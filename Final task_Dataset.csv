1,"Clinton","hello thank you whoa thank you all so much thank you  thank you very very much i have to begin by thanking our host the people of philadelphia  you know a little something about history and about making history and i am so grateful to everyone in this city who hold such a great convention together who were so gracious welcoming and hospitable and i am thrilled that so many americans from everywhere got a chance to see philadelphia to see whats in this great city  people kept coming back from going for walks going to museums going to other sites telling me how much they were impressed and so i want to thank your mayor thank you mayor kenney  i want to thank your congressman who tried to come home to philadelphia every day and i know why because he loves this city bob brady   i am always happy to be here with someone whos been a friend for bill and me over so many years an extraordinary public servant and advocate former governor and mayor ed rendell  now i like tim i had the great pleasure of serving in the senate with senator bob casey and i appreciated his tenacity the attention to detail the work he did for you every single day and so i want to thank bob and i want also to recognize who i hope will be his partner in the senate come november katie mcginty  and i hope the next attorney general for the commonwealth of pennsylvania josh shapiro  this has been such an vigorating exciting week as i said last night we heard from the man from hope bill clinton  and we heard from the man of hope barack obama  and i was so excited to introduce to america our partners it  its going to be fun to travel with both tim and ann because they  they are going to demonstrate to the country what the people of virginia already know theres no better people to have in your corner than tim kaine and ann holten  now i  i dont know about you but i  i stayed up really late last night it was just hard to go to sleep we  oh thank you thank you it  it was so exciting and but i  i have to tell you it was also kind of overwhelming i  i take deeply and with great humility the responsibility that this great campaign imposes on us there is no doubt in my mind that every election in our democracy is important in its own way but i cant think of an election that is more important certainly in my lifetime and its not so much that i am on the ticket it is because of the stark choice that is posed to america in this election so when i did  when i did wake up this morning  thank you  when i  when i  when i did  did start moving and bill and i started drinking our coffee or asking that it be administered through an iv    we suddenly looked at each other and we realized as of tomorrow we have  days to make our case to america  so what better place to kick off this campaign than right here in philadelphia where it all started  years ago i  i believe with all my heart that our founders came together to create one nation because they understood what we understand we are stronger together  and  and as we pointed out during our four great days of our convention you heard something very different from the republicans didnt you we  we might as well have been talking about two different countries or as someone said to me two different planets donald trump painted a picture a negative dark divisive picture of a country in decline he insisted that america is weak and he told us all after laying out this very dark picture that i alone can fix it now as i  as i watched and heard that it set off alarm bells because just think about what happened here  years ago think about our founders coming together a declaration of independence writing a constitution they set up our form of government the longestlasting democracy in the history of the world  and you know they did it they did it  they did it because they knew they didnt want one person one man to have all the power like a king and think about george washington our first president after he served he stepped down voluntarily people around him couldnt believe it but he said no this is the example we should set a democracy requires something from all of us not just people we elect but every single one of us and washington set that example and i dont know any founder no matter how  how strong they were how smart they were who believed that only they could solve our problems so   and ill tell you something else   ill tell  ill tell you something else they also expected a kind of raucous debate in america but at the end of the debate we have to come together and get things done dont we  so as tim said we are going to get on a bus as soon as we leave here and were going to drive through pennsylvania and into ohio its kind of nostalgic for me my dad was born in scranton i spent every summer of my life up in northeast pennsylvania my father my brother went to penn state so i know  i  i know how beautiful this commonwealth is and how wonderful the people are but weve got work to do im not satisfied with the status quo im not telling you that everything is just peachy keen im telling you weve made progress but we have work to do if were going to make sure everybody is included  and  and you know i think that weve got to have more good jobs weve got to raise wages weve got to tackle inequality weve got to make this economy work for everyone not just those at the top  and  and if you listened really closely to the republican convention you know that donald trump talked for  minutes and did not offer one solution in fact his  his speech his whole convention seemed more about insulting me instead of helping the american people  so heres what ive said i will do and were going to get to work on the very first day within the first  days of our administration were going to break through the gridlock in washington and make the biggest investment in new goodpaying jobs since world war ii  were going to do it in infrastructure technology clean energy advanced manufacturing  and im also going to pay special attention to those parts of our country that have been left out and left behind from our inner cities to our small towns from indian country to coal country from communities ravaged by addiction and places hallowed out by plant closures anybody willing to work in america should be able to find a job to get ahead and stay ahead thats my goal  so on our bus tour were going to be visiting a few places where people are making things i find it highly amusing that donald trump talks about make america great again he doesnt make a thing in america except bankruptcies  so theres a lot to be done my friends and im excited im excited to have tim and anne as part of this team and im excited to have the nd president of the united states as part of this team  the four of us are going to barnstorm the country because as a very smart president who just so happens to be here today once said there is nothing wrong with america that cant be cured by whats right with america  so now we had a great convention but weve got to go out and weve got to fight for our vision of the future and i cant do it alone i need each and every one of you heres what id ask you to do please join us go to hillaryclintoncom or text join  join  to  to be part of this campaign and we are hiring organizers here in pennsylvania and across the country  and between now and election day we are going to register three million more people  and were not just going to register them were going to get them to commit to vote  we feel deeply the responsibility for continuing the work that started down the road from here  years ago now nobody who looks like me was thought to be possible to run for president back then no one who looked like barack obama was thought to be possible  but contrary to donald trump i believe every time we knock down a barrier in america it liberates everyone in america  i have to say last night after  after the end of our convention i knew  i knew that every parent in this country could look at their son or their daughter and now say the very same thing you too could be president of the united states thank you all god bless you"
2,"Clinton","and after the convention was over starting friday morning tim kaine and his wonderful wife anne and bill i and i got on a bus and started traveling across pennsylvania into ohio   we visited factories small towns bigger cities we met with so many hardworking people who told us their stories and they proved every day that donald trump is wrong america is not weak   i agree with warren this is the greatest nation on earth and our best days are still ahead of us   now that doesnt mean we dont have challenges and problems of course we do right here at home and around the world  but i dont believe there is anything that americans cant do if we make up our minds because you know why we are stronger together   but as warren said too many people havent gotten a raise since the great crash theres too much inequality and too little opportunity washington is paralyzed by special interests and big money but dont let anyone tell you we dont have what it takes if we make up our minds to solve our problems and dont believe anyone who tells you i alone can fix it    when donald trump said that in his convention speech i did a bit of a mental doubletake i listened to that speech  minutes of it and it was like he was talking about a different country forgetting about everyone in america who gets up every day and works together people who make a difference every single day   hes forgetting our troops on the front lines hes forgetting police officers and firefighters who run toward danger hes forgetting about doctors and nurses who save lives and teachers who change lives hes forgetting about unions who fight for working families and communities that pull together through hard times   i grew up in the midwest i was born in chicago raised outside of chicago my dad was a small businessman i mean really small it was mostly just him and occasionally my mother my brothers and me and sometimes he would hire helpers to get one of his orders out because he printed fabrics to be made into draperies and he had a print plant with long tables he was a very selfreliant man but i dont think he for a minute through his growing up in scranton pennsylvania through his service as a chief petty officer in the navy through his work and business or his raising our family ever thought to himself i alone can fix it thats just not the way we were raised we were raised to get together we were raised to follow up on the extraordinary example of our founders  years ago in philadelphia who came together you see that across nebraska you see people working i have been in omaha i have visited projects schools other kinds of nonprofits and institutions where people are working together thats what we do in america we see a problem and we say we will fix it together and thats what were going to do when we get the white house to move us forward in the direction we need to go   now i know how hard the great recession was it was a terrible time the worst financial crisis since the great depression and people in nebraska worked hard to come back i think it was a terrible moment it could have gotten even worse i believe that a lot of difficult decisions had to be made and we have come back from that terrible financial crisis thanks to the hard work of nebraskans americans and president obama we got out of the ditch we were in   so i think if were going to solve the problems we have we ought to be really clear about where we have come from we now have  million new jobs that have been created in the last sevenandahalf years we now have  million more americans who have access to health care    we have the highest percentage ever in our history of young people walking across graduation stages to get their high school diplomas   so i know we have made progress but i know we shouldnt be satisfied as americans we always have to be asking ourselves what can we do better how can we make more progress how can we help more people were still facing tough challenges that developed long before the recession and they have stayed with us the economy is not working the way it should for everyone   starting in iowa back in april of  until the convention this week i have met so many people who tell me you know they dont expect a handout they dont even expect you know life to be easy but they dont think it should be this hard it shouldnt be that people feel like theyre out there on their own like no one cares about them that theyre not respected that the dignity of their job is not something that we all support i know a lot of people who feel that way i bet there are some in this gymnasium who feel that way well heres what i want you to know you deserve a president who will get up every single day in the white house and do everything she can to give you the chance you deserve to have    and i will quickly add as important as it is to have someone who gets what youre going through i think its also really important that that person tells you what her plans are for producing results   so if you saw what i said on thursday night let me give you the short punchier version and it starts by making clear we do have to rewrite the rules so that our economy works for everyone not just those at the top  my overriding mission as president will be to do everything i can to help our country create more jobs with rising incomes i believe anyone willing to work hard should be able to find a job that pays well enough to support a family   so in my first  days we are going to break through the gridlock in washington and make the biggest investment in new goodpaying jobs since world war ii we are going to make the boldest investment in american infrastructure since the highway system   warren read you some of the quotes from donald trump well he has said so many things that i profoundly vehemently disagree with and for the life of me i dont know why someone runs to be president of the united states who thinks and says we never win anymore our country is full of losers well he could not be more wrong we are going to fix and build the roads the bridges the tunnels the ports the airports the water systems we need   and i want to say a particular word to any of you here from rural nebraska we are going to bring diverse economic development to rural communities to support our farmers and others in small towns who keep america going   and one specific way we will do that is to make sure we have an electric grid that can take and distribute energy from clean renewable sources    in fact i know because ive seen them in the crowd there are few people from iowa here today and your neighbor iowa is already getting onethird of its electricity from clean energy primarily wind energy   and what i love about them is theyre also giving farmers extra income for hosting the turbines on their farm and they are taking abandoned factories and actually assembling the wind turbines putting people to work in iowa to produce the energy for iowa   the other thing were going to do is finish the job of building out broadband so everybody in america no matter where you live has access to the internet"
3,"Clinton","good morning i am so pleased to be here i want to thank you all for the invitation for the introduction to everyone associated with nabj and nahj i want to just mark the moment because you were created in this hotel i dont know if there are any original founders but if there are could you all stand up and we could give you some recognition i am delighted to thank you for the important work you do everyday and now more then ever we need you to keep holding leaders and candidates accountable and in the tradition of pathbreaking journalists like ethel payne and ruben salazar we need you to make sure that americas front pages and nightly new casts and online information reflects the great diversity of our nation someone that i had the privilege of knowing the late great bob maynard former owner of the oakland tribune once said  and i quote bob it is in seeing ourselves whole that we can begin to see ways of working out our differences of understanding our similarities and becoming a more cohesive nation and that is what you do everyday helping us to see ourselves as whole  im looking forward to our discussion which im sure will cover a wide range of issues but i want to take just a few minutes to focus on a challenge that doesnt get enough attention on the campaign trial although ive been trying and that is how do we expand economic opportunity for africanamericans and latinos across america and you know very well  its been said  that when the economy catches a cold communities of color get pneumonia the great recession hit our whole country hard but the toll was especially difficult for black and latino families black wealth was cut in half for latinos it dropped  percent that represented decades even generations of hard work and during these past  months people across our country have described to me how hard its been to get back on their feet in an economy that is still not working the way we all want to see it and barriers of systemic racism makes that even harder now i believe that president obama does not get the credit he deserves for leading us out of the great recession  and i like to remind people he had nothing to do with creating it in the first place  he came into office in this worst of all financial crises since the great depression  was handed to him and i think if you fairly look at the record you have to conclude that his leadership saved us from a great depression  so as bad a things became   million jobs lost  million homes lost  trillion in family wealth wiped out  as bad as it was theres no telling how far down we would have gone without his leadership so we are out of the ditch that we were in and now weve got to do even more weve got to build on the progress weve made  million new jobs in the last seven and a half years  million people now have health insurance who did not have it before he became president so weve got to have the will and the plans together to move forward thats why ive proposed a comprehensive new commitment to african american and latino communities to make serious sustained investments to create more good paying jobs to help families build and rebuild wealth to support black and latino owned small businesses for me these arent just economic issues theyre part of a long continuing struggle for civil rights rosa parks opened up every seat on the bus now weve got to expand economic opportunities so everyone can afford the fare and we have to make sure the bus route reaches every neighborhood and connects families with safe affordable housing and good jobs  sylvia mendez and ruby bridges helped desegregate our schools now weve got to help every family afford the books computers and internet access that our kids need to learn in the st century and so in my first  days as president we will work with both parties to pass the biggest investment in new good paying jobs since world war ii that includes jobs in manufacturing clean energy technology and innovation small businesses and infrastructure if we invest in infrastructure now we will not only create jobs today we will lay the foundation for the jobs of the future were going to also focus on creating jobs and communities where unemployment remains stubbornly high after generations of underinvestment and neglect im a big fan of congressman jim clyburns  plan steering  percent of federal investment to neighborhoods where  percent of the population has been living below the poverty line for  years we need that kind of focused targeted investment in urban places rural places wherever americans have been left out and left behind were also going to invest  billion in creating jobs for young people theres a big gap here the unemployment rate among latino and african american youth is significantly higher than for whites you know its hard to write a resume if you have nothing to put on it were going to help our young people get that first job so they can get that second job so they can build a good solid middle class life that will give them and their families a better future were also going to do more to help black and latino entrepreneurs get access to capital so they have a real chance at turning their ideas into thriving businesses now i think thats not only good for those entrepreneurs its good for their families their workers and their communities additionally as part of our end to end reform of the criminal justice system were going to help people succeed when they return home from jail or prison were going to ban the box so they can be judged by their skills and talents not by their pasts and we will dedicate  billion to provide training and support to returning citizens so they can get a good paying job and in my first  days im going to introduce legislation for comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship  thats not only the right thing to do every independent analysis shows it will add hundreds of billions of dollars to our economy it will also keep families together we need to bring hard working people out of the shadows america has always been a place where people from around the world work hard and apply their talents to american growth and innovation in pursuit of their own dreams so were going to do everything we can to get this done  we need to build an economy and a future that every american can be proud of and be a part of an economy that works for everyone not just those at the top that will be my mission as president these are just some of the highlights of our plan i hope you will go to my website hillaryclintoncom to read the details including how we are going to pay for everything i have proposed and of course i hope you will compare what im proposing to what my opponent is talking about now heres one measure that you could use for that comparison an independent economist recently calculated that if my agenda for jobs and growth is put into place our economy would create at least  million jobs within four years we actually think it could be more than that now this economist also ran the numbers on donald trump including his disastrous and inhumane plan to round up and deport millions of hard working immigrants the result according to mark zandi who was the economic advisor to john mccain during his  run for the presidency the result of trumps plans would be a lengthy recession with  million jobs lost now of course donald trumps problems go far beyond economics at every turn he stokes division and resentment he says horrible things about one group of americans after another hes hearkening back to the most shameful chapters of our history and appealing to the ugliest impulses of our society you know the list youve reported on it he started this campaign by describing mexican immigrants as criminals and rapists he retweets white nationalists he says a distinguished federal judge cant be trusted because he is of mexican heritage he talks about banning muslims from coming to the united states a land built on religious freedom and yes he also talks about curtailing press freedom as well we need to stand up as a country and say that donald trump doesnt represent who we are and what we believe that is what my campaign what tim kaine and i and everyone supporting us is doing everyday and were going to keep at it because i believe with all my heart that america is better than this america is better than donald trump we just launched an all spanish twitter account because we want to bring as many americans as possible into this conversation weve opened offices in every state because we want to compete everywhere we want to bring our message and our vision to all corners of our country but we cant do it alone everyone republican democrat and independent needs to stand up and speak out now i think journalists have a special responsibility to our democracy in a time like this as ida b wells once said people must know before they can act and there is no educator to compare to the press now many of you are showing the way its a badge of honor when jorge ramos gets thrown out of a press conference for challenging donald trump  or when another news organization gets banned for reporting what he says as jorge said the best journalism happens when you take a stand when you denounce injustice so i hope youll keep calling it like you see it keeping holding all of us accountable you know i have laid out all these plans and im well aware that i have been sometimes made fun of for putting out these plans about the economy and education and criminal justice reform and healthcare and gun safety measures and all the rest of it but i do have this old fashioned idea when you run for president you ought to tell the voters of america what you would do as president so i am going to keep telling you what i would do because i want you to hold me accountable press and citizen alike because the stakes are as high as theyve ever been in our lifetimes and we all have to do our part so thank you for what you do everyday thank you for inviting me to address you today and i look forward to taking some of your questions thank you all very much     great   right   its a great question and its one that i obviously have given much thought to because i am determined that we are going to achieve comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship so here is how i see it  first of all we are going to start immediately i want this to be a clear high priority for my administration we will be prepared to introduce legislation as quickly as we can do so i am hoping that the outcome of the election which i am working hard to ensure a victory will send a clear message to our republican friends that its time for them to quit standing in the way of immigration reform if you remember after the  election the republican national committee did what they called an autopsy of their loss and concluded that they could not continue to deny the importance of immigration reform and they urged republicans running for office to get on board now that hasnt turned out the way that they seemed to have hoped we have instead a republican nominee who has been virulently anti immigrant but theres nothing like winning to change minds and i think number one we have a good chance of having a democratic senate if everybody does what i hope they will do and vote for democratic candidates for the senate i believe we will pick up some seats in the house and at least if not take it back narrow the numbers if we move in the senate and then we demand that there be a vote in the house because i am convinced that if the bipartisan bill that had been achieved in the senate  remember when marco rubio was for it and people worked hard and achieved it if it had been allowed to come for a vote in the house it would have passed so i view the political landscape as increasingly favorable to us making this happen i will also defend the presidents executive actions i like you was disappointed with the supreme court decision but remember what it did it sent the case back to be tried it did not determine the case so daca and dapa are still alive trump has said one of his first acts as president would be to eliminate every executive order that president obama has signed including those on immigration issues so i will defend daca and dapa while i work vigorously for immigration reform  i have proposed an office of immigrant affairs for the white house so that we are able to answer questions and provide information and help people i will take a very hard look at the deportation priorities my priority are violent criminals people suspected of any kind of connection to terrorism not hard working mothers and fathers and people who go to work help support this economy pay  billion a year into social security so we will take a hard look at that we will close private detention centers just like i want to end private prisons were going to close private detention centers so i have a very active agenda and were going to be moving on it and i believe  and you know obviously it depends upon the outcome of this election  which is why its so important to register more voters my campaign is trying to register  million more voters convince people to turn out because were going to start early and were going to be tenacious and absolutely committed to getting a positive result i think the chances once we win will improve dramatically   well look i think that the president was committed to immigration reform its one of the reasons we got the bipartisan bill passed in the senate and what we didnt get though was enough political pressure to turn that bill into a voting issue in the  midterm election and heres one of my frustrations people turn out to vote for presidential elections and then often dont for midterm elections so we lost  we lost a lot of the leverage because we lost the house of representatives so nothing happens easily or quickly in modern politics in america but here is what i know as i have said we are not going to be deporting hard working people and breakup families ive been on record for a yearanda half about this and that will be how i direct the department of homeland security to act we are going to push on immigration reform and i will need not only a considerable vote in november but i will need people across our country to make it clear to their elected representatives that theyre going to be held accountable for how they are going to act on immigration reform we put enough organizing and political effort into this i am optimistic and i believe we can get this done but it wont happen simply because we want it and i can only say that i will give you my very best efforts and i will do everything i can to help elect a democratic senate ive already talked to some of my former colleagues in the senate this will be fasttracked we already know what can pass the senate because it happened just a few years ago and if we then put enough pressure on the house and do everything we can to really force them to have to take what the senate passes i think the outcome will be very different this time thats my goal and thats what im going to do every thing i can to achieve    well kristin i appreciate your asking that because i was pointing out in both of those instances that the director comey had said that my answers in my fbi interview were truthful thats really the bottom line here and i have said on  during the interview and in many other occasions over the past months that what i told the fbi  which he said was truthful  is consistent with what i have said publicly so i may have short circuited it and for that i  you know will try to clarify because i think  you know chris wallace and i were probably talking past each other be  because of course he could only talk to what i had told the fbi and i appreciated that now i have acknowledged repeatedly that using two email accounts was a mistake i  and i take responsibility for that but i do think you know having him say that my answers to the fbi were truthful and then i should quickly add what i said was consistent with what i had said publicly and  and thats really sort of in my view trying to tie both ends together   well he  heres  heres what  here are the facts behind that as well you know that i preside i  i sent over  emails to the state department that were workrelated emails director comey said that only  out of  had anything resembling classified markers what does that mean well usually if any of you have ever served in the government a classified document has a big heading on the top which makes very clear what the classification is and in questioning director comey made the point that the  e mails out of the  did not have the appropriate markings and it was therefore reasonable to conclude that anyone including myself would have not  suspected that they were classified and in fact i think that has been discussed by others who have said two out of those three were later explained by the state department not to have been in any way confidential at the time that they were delivered so that leaves the  out of  emails that director comey testified  contained classified information but again he acknowledged there were no markings on those  emails and so what we have here is pretty much what i have been saying throughout this whole year and  and that is that i never sent or received anything that was marked classified now if in retrospect which is what is behind the  number if in retrospect some different agencies said but it should have been  although it wasnt  it should have been thats what the debate about  is about but director comey said there was absolutely no intention on my part to either ignore or in any way dismiss the importance of those documents because they werent marked classified so that would have hard to do and i will go back to where i started i regret using one account ive taken responsibility for that but im pleased to be able to clarify and explain what i think the bottom line is on this   well i had the great honor of working with mike morell spending a lot of hours with him in the situation room in the white house he is a consummate professional who has devoted his entire professional career to protecting our country i was honored to receive his endorsement i will let his comments speak for themselves but i  i really appreciated his explaining as he did in his oped  some of whats at stake in this election    well i  i really  i really believe that the core of his support  im not going to speak for everyone who supports him because i think there have been some quite distressing statements coming out of his rallies and his supporters and who has aligned themselves with him  but i think the core of his support really centers on the disappointment in the economy that so many americans feel and what i have been saying is you know im going to bring this country together i think we have three overarching goals we need more economic opportunity we need to protect our national security and we have got to work toward american unity so i have been trying to understand what it is that has driven people to support trump and ive met with some people i have listened to them and so many of them are looking for an explanation as to why they lost the job they had for  years when the factory closed and nobody cared about them what theyre going to do when their whole life was spent mining coal and they made  thousand a year now they can barely find a job making minimum wage why the centers of so many old industrial towns in america are hollowed out and people are turning to opiates and heroin and the list goes on and thats what ive heard so i think we have to recognize that of course some of the appeal is xenophobic and racist and misogynistic and offensive  we have to acknowledge that but lets not lose sight of the real pain that many americans are feeling because the economy has left them behind so i have said  i said it again in my acceptance speech last thursday i want to be the president for all americans i want to lift up and give everybody a chance to pursue their dreams and that means people who are supporting him when i went to west virginia i knew that i was not gonna win west virginia i can tell you that and i was in a meeting with a group of folks including a coal miner who was incredibly emotional and talking to me and outside there was a big trump protest going on and one of the people at the protest for goodness sakes was blankenship who had just been convicted of reckless indifference toward the wellbeing of his coal miners  causing deaths so clearly the lines are pretty stark but i have said you know ive got a plan for coal country ive got a plan for indian country ive got a plan for inner cities ive got a plan for rural communities its one of the reasons as i said in my remarks that i support jim clyburns  proposal which would help all kinds of communities in america jim and i have talked about this so we have to reject and stand up against the appeals to the kind of bigotry and the use of bluster and bullying that we see coming from trumps campaign but lets not forget the real economic challenges that too many americans of all backgrounds are facing today so thats how i think about it and thats how im going to try in this campaign to respond to and rebuke all of the horrible things he says on a pretty regular basis  but not about me i could care less about that  but when he goes after individuals when he accuses a distinguished federal judge of mexican heritage of not being fair when he insults a gold star family of a muslim american who served in the military  you know the list i will stand up and call him out on that but i will also keep reaching out to americans of all races and ethnicities and where ever they live to tell them that i am not going to forget about them after this election im going work my heart out to help every single person have a better job with a rising income and make sure their kids get a good education and everything else that i think theyre owed here in america    well let me start by saying every time i have done a job people have counted on me and trusted me and at the convention last week we highlighted the fights of my life starting as a lawyer for the childrens defense fund taking on the problem of juveniles in adult jails in south carolina segregated academies socalled in alabama fighting for kids with disabilities to get an education and all the way through the work i did as senator after  and representing all of you as secretary of state so there is  i  and i  i take this seriously dont you know dont doubt that i take it seriously you know it doesnt make me feel good when people say those things and i recognize that i have work to do but when i started running for the senate in new york a lot of the same things were said i won i worked hard for the people of new york and i was reelected with  percent of the vote after i demonstrated that i would be on their side i would fight for the people i represented i ran a really hard campaign against barack obama as i think everybody remembers it got a little contentious from time to time and to my surprise he turns around asks me to be secretary of state because he trusted me and then i served as secretary of state and when i left i had a  percent approval rating so ask yourselves  were  percent of the people in new york wrong were  percent of the american public wrong or maybe just maybe when im actually running for a job there is a real benefit to those on the other side in trying to stir up as much concern as possible so i take it seriously and im going to work my heart out in this campaign and as president to produce results for people to get the economy to work for everybody not just those at the top to do as much as i can to help people who as i said earlier may not even vote for me because i think our country is at a crossroads election president obama said it extremely well both in what his speech discussed in the convention what his press conferences since have pointed out this is a crossroads election there is so much at stake you can look at my record of public service you can meet people and families who were benefited by the childrens health insurance program you can meet people who were benefited by reforming the foster care and adoption system you can meet first responders and survivors from  who were benefited because i went to bat for them you can meet national guards members and their families who didnt have health care unless they were deployed before i worked with republicans to fix that you can go down a long list and wed be happy to provide it to you of what i have done because i believe in public service and i am proud that ive had the great great opportunity to work on behalf of giving more people a better life ever since i was right out of law school so im just going to get up every day and make my case and i think therell be an opportunity for a lot of people to actually hear it   mmhmm   oh my gosh well could i tell you that i am blessed to have a  a crew of great friends and ive had two chiefs of staff who were my africanamerican women friends maggie williams and cheryl mills i have been blessed to have people by my side in politics like minyon moore who is one of the leaders of my campaign ive had a great group of young people who i have been really motivated by and frankly learned from so i really have had a lifetime of friendship going back to my college years when one of my best friends was an africanamerican student so i cant compress into one conversation  theyve supported me theyve chastised me theyve raised issues with me theyve tried to expand my musical tastes so weve had  weve had a lot of  weve had a lot of great great times because of our friendships so i cant really pick one conversation out of you know  years of conversation and i dont want to embarrass my friends peggy lewis is here she just became the dean of communications at trinity washington and i want to congratulate her donna brazile is here shes our acting chair of the dnc so i  i guess ill leave it at that i think im going to  im going to respect the code of friendship silence but please know ive got a lot of great friends who have given me so much more   well i take them seriously because ive had the great privilege of working for many years with latino leaders activists business men and women you know just as i responded to the question my first experience working on behalf of latinos was  well actually even before i was a legal services lawyer through my church i babysat latino kids on saturdays while their parents and older siblings went to the fields outside of my home in chicago which used to be  hard to believe now miles of farmland it was my first real lesson in how much more we all have in common there i was  or  years old babysitting these little kids and at the end of the day the old ramshackle bus stopped at the end of the road and the parents and the older brothers and sisters got out and these little kids just broke loose and started running down that road with their arms outstretched calling for their mothers and their fathers and getting swept up in very tired arms and then when i was a little bit older my church arranged exchanges with latino churches we would go into the city of chicago sit in church basements talk about our lives and again it reinforced what to me was so much of a common sense of you know what we wanted in our lives even though their lives and mine were very different and as a legal services lawyer  as the chair of the legal services corporation we expanded legal services into places against a lot of political opposition  so i feel very fortunate that ive had the chance to work with and learn from so many latinas and latinos across america when i ran for the senate i worked closely with our elected representatives both at the city state and national level i was honored that they rallied around to support me and were part of the great victory that we had in the primary in new york so no i dont take any voter for granted and i particularly dont take any voter who is placing their trust and confidence in me for granted because i am going to get up as i said every single day and work my heart out to get the results that i have told you were going to achieve together and i know its hard ive been around as you all know very well im not new to this it doesnt happen by hoping it happens or wishing it happens it happens by doing everything you possibly can and i am blessed to have such close working relationships and friendships with latino leaders tonight at my house we will be having a big event with latino business leaders coming from around america and so im going to do what ive always done you see i think at the core of political leadership is relationship youve got to build relationships with individuals and communities i know that doesnt happen by just asking for it it happens because you work hard to achieve it so im going to do everything i can to make sure that any latino voter who votes for me knows that im going to be doing my best to deliver on everything that ive said and i will tell you as we go along what the challenges are because i may need to ask your help i may need you to put pressure on elected officials i may need you to flood the internet or flood the old fashioned mailbox of elected representatives so they know people are watching but thats how were going to get it done and im actually pretty confident and optimistic about that so i hope that people will take this election seriously because i sure take you seriously and together i think we can create the kind of future that everyone of our kids and grandkids deserves thank you all very much"
4,"Clinton","i am so happy to be back here and to have this chance to talk with all of you and to be introduced by two of the people that i admire most people who have really made a difference in the lives of so many i know everybody in iowa understand that tom and ruth harkin are as good as you can get there isnt anybody better  and i loved serving with tom i had to confess that i miss the idea that hell be in the senate but you got to hear from patty judge and she would be a great senator for iowa  i want to thank all the elected officials and party officials who are here ive been in lincoln high school before and im glad to be back  how many of you saw the democratic convention  ill tell you i had just the greatest sense of joy and pride as democrats took that stage and not just elected officials and people running for office but so many americans who talked about their lives and what they had gone through and what they had accomplished it was positive it was optimistic it presented a stark contrast to what we had seen the week before at the republican convention  and thats why in this campaign im crossing the country to talk about what we can do to improve the lives of the vast majority of americans to create more opportunities for more people to live up to their own potential and to pursue the american dream and i cant think of a better place to talk about that than right here in iowa because if you build it they will come  after the convention my running mate and i tim kaine got on a bus we went through pennsylvania and ohio stopping at factories and businesses talking to groups listening  doing a lot of listening  about what we need to do together and thats why ive rolled out specific plans about how to create more jobs to get incomes rising in the first  days of my administration we will make the biggest investment in new jobs good paying jobs since world war ii   now how are we going to do that well were going to invest in infrastructure  our roads our bridges our tunnels our ports our airports  these are good jobs and a lot of them are good union jobs with good pay and good benefits for families  you see i have this oldfashioned idea that the middle class of america is what makes americas economy work and what weve been seeing in recent years is a deliberate effort to undermine the middle class some of it because of whats called trickledown economics  cut taxes for the wealthy get out of the way of corporations and that didnt work out so well did it  some of it is because the incredible efforts to undermine the right to organize and bargain collectively the american labor movement helped to create the american middle class  so in addition to infrastructure that you can see were going to do water systems were going to do sewer systems we are also going to build a modern electric grid to take the clean renewable energy that is produced in places like iowa and make sure it can be distributed where it can be used  you know i  i am someone who believes that if we do infrastructure and we do clean renewable energy jobs were going to be on the way to a st century economy that will work for everybody not just those at the top and how do i know this well because in the past weve done infrastructure havent we in fact we are living off the infrastructure built by our parents and our grandparents and in some cases our greatgrandparents a lot of it is overdue  overdue for maintenance overdue for upgrades so this will be good for the economy as well as for individual workers and businesses and how do i know about clean renewable energy partly because i spent a lot of time in iowa last year  anybody who says to me well you know we cant really transition to clean renewable energy i ask them have you been to iowa lately  you already get a third of your electricity from wind and theres going to be a lot of people who will be helped by the kind of work were going to do to make sure that clean renewable energy is available around the country and people who understand that know we can be the clean energy superpower of the st century  and some people get a little carried away have you noticed that  well i get carried away thinking about all the jobs were going to create  and all the families that are going to have a better chance for the future  i also get carried away by thinking about advanced manufacturing because what happened in iowa was not just putting up the turbines you all figured out that you could actually put them together in iowa and employ people who are doing that work and then train people in apprenticeship programs at community colleges to make sure you could maintain those turbines  so the last time ive checked there were about  iowans working in clean renewable energy  the other thing were going to do is help small businesses i just came from visiting a great tshirt company raygun right youve been there raygun  met a young man from iowa who started that company employs about  people right here in des moines has stores all across iowa i see another small businessman that i have gotten to know whose got his own ballet bowl bowling alley thank you so much  but heres what weve got to do weve got to make sure that small businesses particularly those started by young people get the credit they need and if theyve got student debt i want to put a three moratorium on their student debt payments so they can start their business and see whether they can be successful  my dad was a small businessman and i was really excited to see them making tshirts on silk screens because thats what my dad did on a bigger scale when he had a little print plant that printed drapery fabrics using silk screens i used to help him from time to time and i believe in small business thats why i want to be a small business president and thats a big contrast with donald trump who has spent his career stiffing small businesses refusing to pay the bills  i dont know what would have happened in my family if after my dad had worked so hard he showed up with the fabrics that he printed for the drapes and they said sorry were not paying you honestly that is not how we do business in america and so were going to stand up for small business and help create more of them to help create more good jobs here in iowa and across america  we are also going to make the economy fairer how are we going to do that were going to raise the national minimum wage so its no longer a starvation wage  we are also going to do what tom harkin has stood for his entire life were going to make sure people with disabilities have jobs and opportunities in this economy  and were going to make sure that women finally get equal pay for the work we do  so yes ive been laying out plans ever since i showed up here in iowa back in april of  and i am thrilled to be the democratic nominee to be able to campaign on those plans and take them to washington  now ive got to tell you if you look at the plans ive laid out and one of independent analysts have done that heres what they conclude under my plans well create about  million new jobs in america  under donald trumps socalled plans we will lose about three and a half million jobs now let me translate that into iowa because if you divide the country by population here in iowa you could gain  jobs under my plans and lose more than  jobs under donald trumps plans so ive got to tell you what i believe which is that if we want to get the economy working for everybody then we need a campaign that lays out the agenda so people can vote for it so that when im elected i can tell the congress this is what the people of america voted for us to do  so i get pretty excited and pretty carried away enthusiastic about what we can do because weve done it before i couldnt believe all that negative pessimistic talk coming out of the republican convention i didnt know what country they were talking about of course we have challenges yes we have problems of course we do but there is nothing america cant do if we decide to set some goals and pursue them because you know what we are stronger together  and let me say  let me say something about what i think is a critical difference between my opponent and myself words matter my friends  and if you are running to be president or you are president of the united states words can have tremendous consequences yesterday we witnessed the latest in a long line of casual comments from donald trump that cross the line his casual cruelty to a gold star family his casual suggestion that more countries should have nuclear weapons and now his casual inciting of violence every single one of these incidents shows us that donald trump simply does not have the temperament to be president and commanderin chief of the united states  so the stakes have never by higher i am humbled and moved by the republicans who are willing to stand up and say that donald trump doesnt represent their values  not only as republicans but as americans i have to tell you i feel that same sense of responsibility we may not agree on everything but this is not a normal election and i will work hard for the next three months to earn the support of anyone willing to put our country first  as a young man said to me in florida the other day friends dont let friends vote for trump   i also think trumps belief that he alone can fix americas problems is so contrary to who we are as a nation our founders set up our country so that we had three branches of government that had to work together we had the federal government state and local governments that had to work together and thats what weve done so successfully and along comes trump and basically says i can do this alone  well what about the troops on the front lines who rely on each other and support each other what about our law enforcement officers who rely on each other and support each other  what about our teachers and our educators who rely on each other and support each other  what about our doctors and our nurses who rely on each other and support each other  we know that were stronger together because weve seen what happens when we work together and that is exactly what were going to do to build on the progress that weve made to set those goals and go after them together but i cant do this without your help i hope you will join this campaign please join us  join us by texting join  join  or go to hillaryclintoncom we are organizing across iowa  were going to be helping people vote early so that they can make sure that their vote will count were going to be reaching into every part of this state and were going to be talking and listening as we did way back in april to learn whats on the minds of iowans and to figure out what you need from the next president now i know that any election is hard its filled with unpredictable twists and turns but i want you to imagine what you will feel like the day after that election if we have not come together to chart a course of confidence and optimism that will really get our economy working for everyone keep us safe and maintain american leadership around the world and unify our country that is what i will spend every single day working to achieve and with your help iowa we will win iowa we will win the election and then we will work together for the future we are seeking thank you and god bless you"
5,"Clinton","thank you thank you so much i have to tell you i am thrilled to be here for a number of reasons first back in michigan  its wonderful to be back in michigan you can really feel the energy and dynamism that is driving this state to come back and in detroit weve got new businesses opening neighborhoods like midtown and eastern market are coming back the auto industry just had its best year ever  over in ann arbor high tech firms are thriving  the next generation of engineers are getting trained up in houghton and here at future amic so well named you are on the front lines of what i believe will be a true manufacturing renaissance in america  i just was give a short but exciting tour by by mark jurcak and john couch who were telling me about how this company was started as and for most of its early history was an auto supply company and then in  as the market began to change and some of the auto companies began to realign they were faced with a choice we all face choices in life dont we and this company could have just said hey you know our business is not going to be what it was weve got to just fold up lets you know just kind of quit but thats not what happened here and what happened here is what can happen across america you are in now what is largely an aerospace company and   because of the workforce and the work ethic and the commitment of futuramic you are seeing the future unfold so i got to see whats happening here to help build the sls rocket that is going to go from macomb to mars  i saw the two halves of an f nose cone waiting to be put together i talked with some of the workers about the absolute perfection that is required to do this work and what i believe with all my heart is that whats happening here can happen in so many places if we put our minds to it if we support advanced manufacturing if we are the kind of country that once again understands how important it is to build things we are builders and we need to get back to building  so were making progress none of us can be satisfied until the economic revitalization were seeing in some parts of michigan reaches every community but it is inspiring to see this combination of old fashioned hard work and cutting edge innovation and i know my opponent in this election was here in michigan about a week ago and it was like he was in a different place when he visited detroit on monday he talked only of failure poverty and crime he is missing so much about what makes michigan great  and the same is true when it comes to our country he describes america as an embarrassment he said and i quote were becoming a thirdworld country look around you my friends go visit with the workers building rockets that doesnt happen in thirdworld countries  now we have a lot of urgent and important work to do and thats what im going to talk about today because all the people that i have met throughout this campaign really prove how wrong this negative pessimistic view is americas best days are still ahead of us if we make up our minds to actually go out and make that happen  just consider our assets we have the most dynamic productive workforce in the world bar none  we have the most innovative businesses the top colleges universities community colleges training programs in the world and the best science and technologies we have enormous capacity for clean energy production we are resilient determined hardworking there is nothing america cant do if we do it together  and i  i know this because this is how i was raised and i dont think mr trump understands any of it he hasnt offered any credible solutions for the very real economic challenges we face now those challenges emerged long before the great recession and they have persisted through our recovery there is too much inequality too little upward mobility it is just too hard to get ahead today but there are common sense things that your government could do that would give americans more opportunities to succeed why dont we do it because powerful special interests and the tendency to put ideology ahead of political progress has led to gridlock in congress and how can you not be frustrated and even angry when you see nothing getting done and a lot of people feel no one is on their side and no one has their back and that is not how its supposed to be in america if i am fortunate enough to be your president i will have your back every single day that i serve  and my mission in the white house will be to make our economy work for everyone not just those at the top this is personal for me i am the product of the american middle class i was born in chicago i was raised in a suburb but my grandfather worked at the scranton lake mill in scranton pennsylvania for  years and because he worked hard my dad was able to go to college and eventually start his own small business and then send me out into the world to follow my own dreams no matter how far those dreams have taken me i have always remembered i am the daughter of a small business owner and the granddaughter of a factory worker and proud of both  so heres what i want i want every american family to be able to tell the same story if you work hard you do your part you should be able to give your children all the opportunities they deserve that is the basic bargain of america now whether we will be able to renew that bargain on even better terms for the st century depends in large measure on the outcome of this election so here are four questions that i hope the american people will ask of both candidates and that the answers should help make your choice in november crystal clear first which candidate has a real plan to create good paying jobs second who will restore fairness into our economy and ensure that those at the top pay their fair share of taxes  third who will really go to bat for working families and fourth who can bring people together to deliver the results that will make a difference in your lives now  now i hope that after giving a fair hearing to both sides you will join the millions of people across our country supporting this campaign not just democrats but a growing number of republicans and independents as well now when it comes to creating jobs i would argue its not even close even conservative experts say trumps agenda will pull our economy back into recession and according to an independent analysis by a former economic advisor to senator john mccain if you add up all of trumps ideas from cutting taxes for the wealthy and corporations to starting a trade war with china to deporting millions of hardworking immigrants the result would be a loss of  million jobs now by contrast the same analyst found that with our plan the economy would create more than  million new jobs  so let me tell you how we would do that i believe every american willing to work hard should be able to find a job that provides dignity pride and decent pay that can support a family so starting on day one we will work with both parties to pass the biggest investment in new good paying jobs since world war ii  we will put americans to work building and modernizing our roads our bridges our tunnels our railways our ports our airports  we are way overdue for this my friends we are living off the investments that were made by our parents and grandparents generations we will also help cities like detroit and flint connect underserved neighborhoods to opportunity expanding affordable housing and we will repair schools and failing water systems as well  you know i happen to think we should be ambitious while were at it lets connect every household in america to broadband by the year   its astonishing to me how many places in america not way way far away from cities but in cities and near cities that dont have access to broadband and that disadvantages kids who are asked to do homework using the internet five million of them live in homes without access to the internet so you talk about an achievement gap it starts right there and lets build a cleaner more resilient power grid with enough renewable energy to power every home in our country as well  some country is going to be the clean energy super power of the st century and create millions of jobs and businesses its probably going to be either china germany or america i want it to be us we invent the technology we should make it and use it and export it which will help to grow our economy and heres something that you dont always hear enough of from democrats a big part of our plan will be unleashing the power of the private sector to create more jobs at higher pay and that means for us creating an infrastructure bank to get private funds off the sidelines and compliment our private investments twentyfive billion dollars in government seed funding could a lot more than  billion and really get our country moving on our infrastructure plans and were going to invest  billion in what were calling make it in america partnerships to support american manufacturing and recommit to scientific research that can create entire new industries   when mark and john were giving me the tour and i was talking to some of the workers along the way and asking them where some of the precision machinery came from that is being used here at futuramic it what i hear all over the country germany japan italy i want to bring that precision manufacturing back to the united states there is no reason we cant begin to make those machines ourselves and supply the rest of the world instead of buying from somewhere else lets also expand incentives like the new market tax credits that can bring businesses government and communities together to create good jobs in places that have been left out and left behind from neglected neighborhoods in detroit and flint to logging country coal country native american communities from rural areas ravaged by addiction and lost jobs to industrial regions hollowed out when factories closed  as president i will also make a major push to empower small businesses and entrepreneurs with   with new national initiatives to cut red tape at every level and expand access to credit especially through community banks and credit unions i will propose a new plan to dramatically simplify tax filing for small businesses  right now the smallest businesses the kind that my dad had  it was a really small business  spent  times more per employee to prepare their taxes compared to larger companies it should be as easy as printing out a bank statement lets free entrepreneurs to do what they do best initiative grow and hire as mark said this company started because of a drive down a road and thinking about it talking about it then seeing one of the old oldsmobile futuramics and deciding  hey not only do i have an idea ive got a name in america if you can dream it you should be able to build it and were going to get back to doing that  now donald trump has a different view hes made a career out of stiffing small businesses from atlantic city to las vegas there are companies that were left hanging because he refused to pay their bills a lot of those companies scraped together what they could to pay their employees and many of them put their businesses at risk and someone of them ended up taking bankruptcy it wasnt because trump couldnt pay them it was because he wouldnt pay them and thats why i take it personally my dad ran a printing plant he had two really long tables he printed fabric for draperies he would lay out the fabric and then he would take a silk screen and he would go down the table hed put the silk screen down and hed pour the paint in hed take the squeegee hed go across the screen hed lift it up hed go down  go down all the way to the end and then he would start on the other table he worked hard and then when he finished he would load all that fabric up put it in his car and take it to the business that had ordered it maybe a restaurant or a hotel or some office he expected to be paid when he showed up he did the work he paid for the supplies and the labor that he often hired to help him on big jobs he expected to be paid i cant imagine what would have happened to my father and his business if he had got a contract from trump and showing up and submitting his bill had been told were not going to pay and if you dont like it sue us my father never could have sued a big organization like that i just dont understand it ive met all kinds of workers painters plumbers ive met small businesses that provided pianos installed glass or marble all of whom were denied payment and after going back time and again being told well maybe well pay you  cents on the dollar or  cents on the dollar thats not how we do business in america so weve got to create more good jobs that are going to help more people for example our modern service economy is empowering consumers with more choices than greater flexibility but we do have to empower the workers in our service sector too the people taking care of our children and our parents they deserve a good wage and good benefits and a secure retirement  and its crucial that every american have access to the education and skills they need to get the jobs of the future so we will fight to make college tuition free for the middle class and debt free for everyone  we will also liberate millions of people who already have student debt by making it easier to refinance and repay what you owe as a portion of your income so dont have to pay more than you can afford  it  it is just not right that donald trump can ignore his debts but students and families cant refinance their debt  and heres something else that i really want to emphasize i dont think anybody in america is talking about this enough and that is a fouryear degree should not be the only path to a good job in america  you should be able to learn a skill practice a trade make a good living doing it so many americans have the talent and the will to succeed whether theyre kids right out of high school or older people displaced by automation and outsourcing and for too long big promises about the power of training and retraining havent delivered like they should it doesnt help anybody to be trained for a job that doesnt exist so heres what were gonna do we will support highquality union training programs we will propose  we will propose new tax credits to encourage more companies to offer paid apprenticeships that lets you earn while you learn  we will do more including a national campaign to dignify skills training across the board  i  i think we gotta reverse what has become a kind of you know common placed view which is everybody needs to go to college well in fact more than half of the jobs that are going to be available in  do not require a college fouryear degree so for welders and machinists and tool and dye  makers and health technicians and coders and so many others lets get the word out there are really good jobs for people right now and there will be more in the future if you get the skills in high school at community college in an apprenticeship or other training programs  and i  i wanna acknowledge the great role that the community college here in macomb county has played in working with companies like this one to make sure people do have the skills now i imagine some of you might be thinking well that all sounds good but what about trade after all trump talks about it all the time well lets start with this it is true that too often past trade deals have been sold to the american people with rosy scenarios that did not pan out those promises now bring hollow in many communities across michigan and our country that have seen factories close and jobs disappear too many companies lobbied for trade deals so they could sell products abroad but then they instead moved abroad and sold back into the united states it is also true that china and other countries have gamed the system for too long enforcement particularly during the bush administration has been too lax investments at home that would make us more competitive have been completely blocked in congress and american workers in communities have paid the price but the answer is not to rant and rave or cut ourselves off from the world that would end up killing even more jobs the answer is to finally make trade work for us not against us so my message  my message to every worker in michigan and across america is this i will stop any trade deal that kills jobs or holds down wages including the transpacific partnership  i oppose it now ill oppose it after the election and ill oppose it as president as a senator from new york i fought to defend new yorks manufacturers and steel makers from unfair chinese trading practices  and i opposed the only multilateral trade deal that came before the senate while i was there because it didnt meet my high bar and as secretary of state i fought hard for american businesses to get a fair shot around the world and to stop underhanded trading practices like currency manipulation and the theft of intellectual property so as president i will stand up to china and anyone else who tries to take advantage of american workers and companies  and i am going to ramp up enforcement by appointing for the first time a cheap trade prosecutor i will triple the number of enforcement officers and when countries break the rules  we wont hesitate to impose targeted tariffs  now mr trump may talk of big game on trade but his approach when it comes to trade is based on fear not strength fear that we cannot compete with the rest of the world even when rules are fair fear that our country has no choice but to hide behind walls if team usa was as fearful as trump michael phelps and simone biles would be cowering in the locker room afraid to come out and compete instead they are winning gold medals america isnt afraid to compete right now thousands of michigan companies are exporting billions of dollars of products around the world we want them to sell even more and create even more jobs here at home but corporations should not abandon profitable operations in the united states to move abroad just to give shareholders a quicker return ceos a bigger bonus and unions a weaker hand to play now before he tweets about how he is really the one who will put america first and trade lets remember where trump makes many of his own products because it sure is not america  he has made trump ties in china and trump suits in mexico instead of here in michigan he keeps saying its not possible to make these things in america anymore thats just wrong so we created a website hillaryclintoncommakeithere on it we list  places across the united states that are already producing similar goods one positive thing trump could do to make america great again is to actually make great things in america again now lets look at the second question which candidate will fight for fairness and this is an urgent need we need to grow the economy and make it fairer the tide is not rising fast enough and certainly not lifting all boats since the crash too many of the gains have gone to the top one percent the rules and incentives in our system reward corporations for putting shortterm stock prices above long time investment in their workers equipment and research while corporate profits are at near record high paychecks for most people have barely budged incomes arent growing fast enough to keep up with the cost of living for things like prescription drugs and childcare i believe every employee from the ceo suite to the factory floor contributes to a business success so everyone should share in the rewards especially those putting in long hours for little pay so im proposing a new tax credit to encourage more companies to share profits with more  and more broadly we will fight for a more progressive or patriotic tax code that puts american jobs first right now when a corporation outsources jobs and production it could write off the cost we must stop that and we must make them pay back any tax break they ever received them from any level of government in our country  and for those that move their headquarters overseas to avoid paying their fair share of taxes theyre going to have to pay a new exit tax so if they want to go theyre going to have to pay to go  and wall street corporations and the super rich should finally pay their fair share of taxes thats why i support the socalled buffet rule because multimillionaires should not be able to pay a lower tax rate than their secretaries  we should also add a new tax on multimillionaires crack down on tax gaming by corporations and close the carried interest loop holes something ive advocated for years now compare what trump says now there is a myth out there that he will stick it to the rich and powerful because somehow hes really on the side of the little guy dont believe it not when he pledges to rip up basic rules that hold corporations accountable when he wants to scrap regulations that stop polluters from poisoning the air our children breathe and the water we drink let insurance companies write their own rules again trump would roll back the tough rules that we have imposed on the financial industry ill do the opposite i think we should strengthen those rules so wall street can never wreck main street again  trump even wants to abolish the consumer financial protection bureau a new agency that has already returned more than  billion to  million americans who were taken advantage of by corporations why would you get rid of that and then there is trumps tax plan he would give trillions in tax cuts to big corporations millionaires and wall street money managers that would explode our national debt and eventually lead to massive cuts in priorities like education healthcare and environmental protection in his speech on monday he called for a new tax loop hole lets talk it the trump loop hole because it would allow him to pay less than half the current tax rate on income from many of his companies hed pay a lower rate than millions of middle class families one non partisan expert at the tax policy center described this plan as and i quote a really nice deal for donald trump of course its hard to say how nice because he refuses to do what every other presidential candidate in decades has done and release his tax returns  but we do know that the  richest tax payers in america would get an average tax cut of more than  million a year from the trump loop hole and then theres the estate tax which trump wants to eliminate all together now if you believe that hes as wealthy as he says that alone would save the trump family  billion it would do nothing for  percent of americans so theyd get a  billion tax cut and  percent of americans would get nothing just think of what we could do with those  billion we could pay for more than  veterans to get a four year college degree we could provide a years worth of healthcare to nearly three million kids or we could fund a years worth of federal assistance to state and local law enforcement  i think there are a lot of better ways to spend the money on monday im going to be in scranton pennsylvania with vice president biden and he has a saying dont tell me what you value show me your budget and i will tell you what you value well   donald trump wants to give trillions in tax breaks to people like himself i want to invest it in veterans our kids our police officers and so much more and you can then draw your own conclusion about values now its true that both of us have proposed to cut taxes for middle class families hes making a big promise but his advisers have said  his own advisers have said he may not stand by them instead the tax cuts he doubledowns on in his speech in detroit on monday offered trillions to the richest americans and corporations and one of the differences between donald trump and me is im telling you what i will do im laying out my plans and i will stand by them and want you to hold me accountable for delivering results  you know this all reminds me of that old saying if it sounds too good to be true it probably is and that brings us to the third question which candidate can you actually count on to go to bat for workers and working families it is not enough to pay lip service to being on your side we have to recognize how americans actually live and work in the st century and then offer real solutions that make your lives easier we know that women are now the sole or primary breadwinner in a growing number of families we know more americans are cobbling together parttime work or striking out on their own so we have to make it easier to be good workers good parents and good caregivers all at the same time thats why ive set out a bold vision to make quality affordable childcare available to all americans and limit the cost to  percent of family income  on monday trump offered his first real ideas on this topic because previously he had dismissed concerns about childcare he said it was quote not an expensive thing because you just need some blocks and some swings now he says he wants to exclude childcare payments from taxation his plan was panned from the left the right the center because it transparently is designed for rich people like him he would give wealthy families  or  cents on the dollar for their nannies and little or nothing for millions of hardworking families trying to afford childcare so that they can get to work and keep the job  i think instead we should expand the child tax credit to provide real relief to tens of millions of working families struggling with the cost of raising children  the same families that his plan ignores and thats just a start because the more we do to help working families the more our entire economy will benefit for example guaranteeing equal pay wont just increase paychecks for women it will boost family budgets and get incomes rising across the board  and i dont understand why trump is against that paid family leave will not only make life easier for moms and dads it will also keep skilled talented americans in the workforce and grow our economy thats why every other advanced country already has it again hes against it raising the federal minimum wage wont just put more money in the pockets of lowincome families it also means they will spend more at the businesses in their neighborhoods  this is  this is something that even the original automakers understood way back at the beginning of the th century when they decided to pay the unbelievable sum of  a day to autoworkers and when they were criticized by other businesses  how can you pay that much they had the best answer we want people to be able to buy our cars this is economics  we need to get incomes and wages rising and it will help the whole economy grow and be fairer  and protecting and expanding social security doesnt just help older americans retire with dignity it helps to ease burdens on families and communities and i also believe the same thing about comprehensive immigration reform we already have millions of people working in the economy and paying  billion a year to social security even though they are undocumented so by moving toward reform we will unleash a lot of new income and growth and we will level the playing field so that american workers cannot be taken advantage of because undocumented workers can be exploited by employers which is one of the reasons we have this disconnect and finally strengthening unions does not just serve members it leads to better pay and benefits and working conditions for all employees  so i have also said i will defend and improve the affordable care act for me that includes giving americans in every state the choice of a public option health insurance plan that will help everyone afford coverage it will strengthen competition and drive down costs now these are all causes i have worked on for decades and i believe they point to a fundamental truth about the economy it can seem like zero sum  when you are competing for a job promotion or contract if someone wins and someone loses but that is not the full picture if you step back you can see we are all in this together if we grow together we can all rise together and you know what i like to say we are all stronger together the fourth question is key and its this who can bring people together to get any of this done right well  i believe i can because i think i can provide serious steady leadership that can provide common ground to build on it based upon hard but respectful bargaining with the other side leadership that rises above personal attacks and namecalling not revels in it i just do not think insults and bullying is how we are to get things done i do not think that that is the appropriate approach for us i know its hard to imagine but there was a time when democrats and republicans actually worked together i know thats true i did it as first lady senator and secretary of state it is how we created the childrens health insurance program which covers eight million kids it is how we rebuilt new york after  and how we passed a treaty to reduce the threat from russias nuclear weapons so i am convinced based on my experience that we can do this one of the reasons that i asked senator tim kaine to be my running mate is that he also has a record of working across the aisle to get things done as a mayor governor and a senator so we are going to make full use of the white houses power to convene we are going to get everyone at the table not just republicans and democrats but businesses and labor unions academics but most importantly americans like all you i think there are a lot of great ideas out in america and i want you to have a say and that means weve got to get unaccountable money out of politics overturn citizens united and expand voting rights not restrict them i intend starting even before the election to bring together leaders from across the economy from a lot of different places to talk about jobs and competitiveness i hope mark and john can join me because we need the best ideas that are out there making a difference  we need to pull together the bottomline is this i am running for president to build an economy that works for everyone not just those at the top  and based on what we know from the trump campaign he wants americans to work for him and his friends at the expense of everyone else he has offered no credible plans to address what working families are up against today nothing on student loans or the cost of description drugs nothing for farmers or struggling rural communities  nothing to build a new future with clean energy and advance agriculture nothing for communities of color in our cities to overcome the barriers of systemic racism nothing to create new opportunities for young all it is just a more extreme version of the failed theory of trickle down economics with his own addition of outlandish trumpian ideas that even republicans reject and as we heard him say at his convention he may believe that he alone can fix our country but clearly he doesnt know the people of michigan he doesnt see the businesses and the labor unions the local governments the clergy coming together every single day to make things better so yeah there is still a long road ahead but michigan is on the rise and everyone is contributing thats america at its best so i hope you will stay active and engaged and working together to create jobs and to strengthen your own communities and i hope you will work to get out the vote in november because if we  if we are able to win then i want you all to work with me to build the kind of progress that america deserves to see were going do this together we are stronger together lets go out and build the future thank you all god bless you"
6,"Clinton","hello  wow hello everyone   thank you thank you all so much it is so great to be back in scranton pennsylvania  i cant tell you how important this is we both have a lot of memories of scranton and lake winola thats right  and it is such a nostalgic trip for me because my brothers are here we came to lake winola every summer of my life and loved every minute of it  and there are a lot of people in this crowd who our family has known or joes family has known over the years and we are grateful to each and every one of you its also wonderful to be here in scranton with senator bob casey  and your congressman matt cartwright  and your amazing lackawanna county recorder of deeds evie rafalki mcnulty  and we sure miss that husband of yours were thinking about you and sending you our best wishes were also here with auditor general eugene depasquale too  and of course as i said im here with the one the only vice president joe biden  you know joe grew up over on north washington avenue  no matter how far he travels he never forgets where hes from i have seen him in a lot of settings in the spotlight as vice president and senator in quiet moments with constituents and in the situation room helping to make decisions that affect our lives and security and wherever he goes hes always the same guy a fighter for everyone a champion for towns like scranton and above all a fighter for families    and you know i think hed be the first to say that he cares about your families because of his family joe senior and catherine taught joe that all people deserve to be treated with dignity when you see someone fall you help them back up because we are all in this together that is the biden way  we have seen how he fights for working families because he passionately believes in the basic bargain that makes america great that our economy should work for everyone not just those at the top  he stands up against injustice he has led the fight to end violence against women and girls  and he stands up for peoples lives and health including the project hes now leader on behalf of president obama the cancer moonshot to fund breakthroughs and save lives  as many of you know his wonderful son beau a great father a great public servant a great human being passed away last year so this is personal to joe biden he knows its personal to a lot of families thats why hes fighting so hard to make a difference and if im elected this fall im going to ask joe to continue the important work hes begun to help us fight and defeat cancer  so as someone who has worked with joe for years first in the senate then as a member of the obamabiden cabinet i can attest to that passion for standing up for people trying to make lives better its what pushes him to work as hard as he can every second of every day for all of us and joe and his wonderful wife jill have raised their children and grandchildren with those same values so joe i hope you know how much not just scranton but america loves you and your family so it means a great deal to have him by my side you know when joe and i were deciding where to have our first campaign rally there really was only one answer scranton isnt just joes hometown its my dads hometown too while the bidens were on north washington avenue my family the rodhams were a few blocks away on diamond avenue i was christened at the methodist church on court street my grandfather went to work at the scranton lace mill starting as a teenager it wasnt easy work but you know what i learned that business treated its workers right believe it or not the scranton lace company all those years ago actually offered a profit sharing plan and health benefits at the beginning of the th century they understood something that a lot of folks have forgotten they understood that their workers were responsible for much of the businesses success so it was only fair that they shared in that success and that their families benefited too and because of that job my grandfather could give my father a better life my father was able to go to college went to penn state where he played football then after he got out of penn state it was  right in the depths of the depression and he was looking for a job he heard a friend of his knew somebody who heard that somebody was hiring in chicago so he literally hopped a freight train from scranton to chicago  i dont recommend that anymore  where he got a job as a salesman he went into the navy during world war ii and when he got out he started a small business in chicago where i grew up and just like his father before him my dad was determined to give us even greater opportunities than he had and to me that is the american dream no matter where life takes me i always remember i am the granddaughter of a factory worker and the daughter of a small business owner and i am so proud of it and you know the story of the rodhams and the bidens isnt unique whats unique is the country where those stories were written no matter what donald trump says america is great and the american dream is big enough for everyone to share in its promise but that doesnt mean we can take it for granted and just wait until it happens to us we have a lot of work to do here in scranton you know that president obama and vice president biden pulled us back from the worst financial crisis since the great depression and put our economy back on a stronger footing i personally dont think they get enough credit for that under their leadership weve created  million new private sector jobs  million people now have health care and the auto industry just had its best year ever so i think the job of the next president is to build on that but to take on the deeper challenges that emerged long before the crisis and have persisted through our recovery inequality is too high wages are too low it is still too hard for too many to get ahead  so my top priority is create an economy that works for everyone not just those at the top which is why ive set five ambitious goals to get us there first we are going to make the biggest investment in new goodpaying jobs since world war ii  second were going to make college debtfree for all and help millions of people struggling with existing student debt  third were going to crack down on companies that shift jobs and profits overseas  and were going to reward companies that share profits with their employees like the scranton lace company did almost a century ago  fourth fourth   thank you  fourth were going to make sure that wall street corporation and the super rich finally pay their fair share of taxes  and fifth were going to respond to the way american families actually live and work today by making childcare affordable because in todays economy there is often no parent or grandparent staying home with the kids and were going to fight for paid family leave because sometimes you need to take care of your child or your spouse or sick parent and you should not lose your job for taking care of the loved ones  now you know whenever i mentioned these issues you know donald trump always said that im playing the womans card well you know what i say if thats playing the womans card then deal me in  i really believe that together this plan will go a long way toward building a stronger fairer economy where everyone can contribute to its growth everyone can share in its rewards now by contrast whats trumps plan well he laid it out last week and ill admit even before he did i didnt think it was going to be good for working americans but it turned out to be worse than i ever imagined  i know some of you may have friends up here in north eastern pennsylvania who are thinking about voting for trump you know  i know i know friends should not let friends vote for trump   but just in care you can have a conversation explain that donald trump would give trillions  thats trillions with a t  in tax cuts to big corporations millionaires and wall street money managers that would explode the national debt  and it would lead to massive cuts in things like education and healthcare hes even called for a new tax loophole lets call it the trump loophole because it would allow trump to pay less than half the current tax rate on income for many of his companies a pretty sweet deal he would end up paying a rate lower than millions of middleclass families now that is assuming he pays any taxes at all because we really dont know because we havent seen his tax return  but we do know just by looking at the data we know that the  richest taxpayers in america would get an average tax cut of more than  million a year from the trump loophole and then of course theres the estate tax that trump wants to eliminate all together now if you believe that hes as wealthy as he claims that would save the trump family  billion but it would do nothing for  percent of all the other americans in our country so yes  billion tax cut for trump  percent of americans get nothing think of what we could do with those  billion we could pay for more than  veterans to get a fouryear college degree  we could provide a year  years worth of healthcare to nearly  million kids or we could fund a years worth of federal assistance to state and law  local law enforcement so there are a lot of better ways to spend the money  and theres one more part of trumps plan that i want to mention hes now saying he wants to help people pay for child care by excluding those payments from taxation well again guess who that will help the most it will help rich people who will get  to  cents on the dollar to pay for their nannies hardworking families who cant afford childcare in the first place well get little to no real help thats why his childcare plan has been panned by experts across the political spectrum left right and center because remember right now childcare costs as much as in state college tuition in most of the country so we need real solutions that will work for working people not just the well off and to prove that he really cares about this issue trump made a point about talking about how his businesses offer on site child care to workers well that kind of perked  me up  because if he really did that it would be a big deal i wish more companies would provide onsite childcare that would be a huge benefit for employees but like so much of what he says is not true it turns out some of his resorts hotels and clubs offer child care services but for guests not employees just saying if you stay at a trump hotel you could enroll your kid in something called trump kids  they will get special childrens room service childrens spa service even a nanny for a fee but if you work for his business if you clean the rooms water the lawns carry peoples bags you get nothing im not even sure trump knows that providing a trump kids program for paying customers is not the same thing as providing real child care for your workers just like his tax breaks for billionaires arent the same as a real plan to help americas working families you know vice president biden has a saying i love dont tell me what you value show me your budget and ill tell you what you value  no its pretty clear donald trump wants to give trillions of tax breaks to people like himself not invest in our veterans our kids our police officers our teachers and anyone who really provides services and we have real serious challenges in america we need serious leadership this is not a reality tv show its as real as it gets look at whats happening in milwaukee right now weve got urgent work to do to rebuild trust between police and communities ad get back to the fundamental principle  everyone should have respect for the law and be respected by the law  so on all these important challenges you have to ask yourself is trump up to the job hes giving a speech  hes giving a speech about isis today now ive laid out my strategy for defeating isis over many months we will strike their sanctuaries from the air and support local forces taking them out on the ground under president obama and vice president biden we are making progress we will surge our intelligence so we detect and prevent attacks before they happen we will disrupt their efforts online to reach and radicalize young people in our country it wont be easy or quick but make no mistake we will prevail there is no doubt in my mind    and once again in comparison donalds been all over the place on isis he talked about letting syria become a freezone for isis a major country in the middle east that could launch attacks against us and others hes talked about sending ground troops american ground troops  well that is off the table as far as i am concerned  so well wait and see what he says today but sometimes he says he wont tell anyone what hell do because he wants to keep his plan quote secret and then it turns out the secret is he has no plan  and that was very clear when he said i know more about isis than the generals no donald you dont and on top of that he says more countries should have nuclear weapons including in the middle east he talks about walking away from our european allies he has the temerity to say that the united states military is a disaster well i wish hed spent as much time as joe and i have meeting the brave young men and women who serve in the military meeting their families meeting with gold star families those are not the words of someone who respects our military and the sacrifice that our young men and women make every single day  i said in philadelphia that a man you can bait with a tweet is not a man you can trust with nuclear weapons its also not a man you can trust to run our economy help heal our cities or be a role model for our children there is no doubt donald trump is temperamentally unfit and totally unqualified to be president of the united states and commanderinchief  so my friends america deserves a president who can get the job done bring our country together not tear it apart deliver real results for hardworking americans and we cant win this election without you thats why im asking you to join right now take out your phone and text join or go to hillaryclintoncom we are hiring organizers right here in pennsylvania and across the country we are going to run a vigorous campaign across pennsylvania were going to keep building the future that you and your families deserve and i am so sure we can do this especially with this man fighting alongside us just like he always has so scranton please lets give it up for the vicepresident of the united states joe biden"
7,"Clinton","hello philadelphia  wow i  thank you thank you thank you so much i  i am so excited to be back in the city that hosted the greatest convention  i  i cant tell you as ive been travelling across the country how many people have said to me how much they loved being in philadelphia  and believe it or not there  there are some people who hadnt been to philadelphia before the convention and they left loving this city and i cant thank all of you enough for all the hospitality i want to thank my longtime friend congressman bob brady  thanks to mayor jim kenney  state senator vincent hughes state representative dwight evans councilwoman jannie blackwell city council president darrell clarke a long time friend of mine former city councilwoman marian tasco  and all those who spoke in the preprogram and to everybody gathered here it is exciting to be back and as you heard we want you all to register to vote we have places to register because we dont want you on the sidelines come november this is the most consequential election the stakes could not be higher and we want everybody in philadelphia everybody across pennsylvania to be part of a great victory in november and then  the future that were going to build together  have any of you been watching the olympics  well ive got to tell you i am a big olympics fan i  those athletes what they give up the sacrifice the work i understand that philadelphias own nia ali just made the first round heat in the  meter hurdles today team usa is showing the world what this country stands for  i am proud of our team there and im proud of the incredible teamwork that they show i was thinking the other day when donald trump speaks he speaks about fear he speaks about such negativity and such pessimism and then i watched the olympics and its exactly the opposite you have young people going out doing their best every day to get prepared to compete and thats what were going to do in america  there is nothing we cant do if we put our minds to it   i i was up in scranton yesterday with vice president joe biden    and we had a great day both joe and i have in scranton so we saw a lot of people that were related to a lot of      how do you do it they see me on tv and on  tape  and im in another state then im in another state and im lucky i can sleep on      and held but what its really all about is getting up everyday and being motivated to make sure that every person  and every person in this commonwealth and every person in this country has the same chance to live up to your dreams the same opportunities that previous generations of americans enjoyed      educators in the audience who make dreams come true   because actually so i know what we can do together but how are we going to pay for it well ill tell you how were going to pay for it  were going where the money is were going after the super wealthy were going after the corporations were going after wall street so they pay their fair share  thats why i was so surprised when donald trump came out and talked about the economy because actually he would give trillions of dollars in more tax breaks to the wealthy he wants a new tax loophole that we call the trump loophole that would actually help him and everybody else who is really wealthy to cut their tax rate in half on a lot of their income he wants to eliminate the estate tax which does nothing for  percent of all americans but you know if trump is as wealthy as he claims to be it would save his family  billion i got to tell you   billion early childhood helping our veterans helping our law enforcement do what they need to do helping more people get the job training and the skills training in fact we could hire  public school teachers for  billion  we could actually    health care for our veterans for  billion and we could invest in affordable housing and small businesses for  billion right here in pennsylvania so i think we know what we need to do the question is whether we will do it and that all comes down to who shows up and votes thats why we have been registering voters in our campaign we launched a drive to register  million voters and get those voters to commit to vote it doesnt do you any good if youre registered and you dont show up right so weve got people waving over there theyve got their voter registration forms for you  and we want you to be part of this so heres what im asking im asking you to register yourself and im asking you to ask everybody you know to register because when we do that we make a commitment that we care about whats gonna happen in this election  and we also care about winning back the senate that  making the senate democratic again    and trying to pick up some more democrats in the house of representatives that will help too  you see i have this oldfashioned idea looking at our last two democratic presidents president obama and    and a guy named clinton that we got a lot done for america when they were in office right  you know when i hear folks criticizing president obama im thinking well what dont they like they dont like the fact that he helped save the economy from the worst financial crash since the s they dont like the fact we now have  million more people who have access to affordable health care they dont like the fact that his intervention saved the auto industry and imposed the toughest new rules on wall street what dont they like when i hear people criticize bill i think what dont they like the peace or the prosperity its kind of hard to know  so dont be complacent my friends because even though were doing fine right now im not taking anybody anywhere for granted were going to work hard these next  days and i cant do it without your help  now we have packets for you at the door so you can also canvass meet your neighbors canvass across west philly after this event this evening were opening our southwest philly office on nd and cedar stop by the deadline for registering is october the  so we have work to do but heres what i promise you i promise you that were going to go not only as hard as we can to win this election but then to go as hard as we can to achieve the results that the country needs and thats why i talk specifically about what i want to do i know that some people make fun of me they say oh she has all these plans and you can go to my website and read my plans but ill tell you  you know why i do that because i want you to know what im going to try to do so you can both help me and hold me accountable for doing what i told you i want to do  we want to create millions of new good jobs and infrastructure because our roads our bridges our tunnels our ports our airports are falling apart our water systems our sewer systems are falling apart and we also need a new modern electric grid to be able to take and distribute all the clean renewable energy that were going to be producing and when people say to me we cant bring manufacturing back to the united states i say but ive seen it i have seen what we can do i have been in plants in pennsylvania in ohio across america who are doing just that and when i meet the people theres such pride and dignity when i was in johnstown wire technologies on our bus trip with tim kaine and i met people working there i met a young marine veteran hes been there now a couple of years he is as proud as he can be because hes making something that really makes a difference and that is exported around the world from johnstown pennsylvania so dont tell me we cant make things i know we can i was in a plant outside of detroit last week it used to be an autosupply plant then in   it was started in  by the grandfather of the guy whos the chair of their board now in  they started they were making auto parts then in  their main customer one of the auto makers moved a lot of their production  now they could have been really just broken by that they could have said you know what we gotta close up shop but thats not what they did they were so determined to keep that business going so they said what skills do we have what can we do now and they got into the aerospace business  there i saw the nosecone of a f there i saw the parts theyre making for nasa for the rocket that will take astronauts on the manned mission to mars in warren michigan a place that used to make auto parts which is now literally making rocket parts and you know what i thought i thought wait a minute this could have been one of those sort of poor me stories you know we cant do it we cant compete but instead people got up and said yes we can and yes they did right  and i started looking at the machines that they were using a lot of precision machines made in germany made in japan made in italy i said to the workers there could we make those machines they said you bet we could if we have the right partnership between our government and manufacturing we can have a renaissance in manufacturing and jobs that will give people good livings and the pride and dignity of work and heres something we dont say often enough more than half of the jobs that are predicted for  are not going to require a four year college degree so i want to make college affordable for everybody and were going to get that done  i want to help you refinance and pay down your student debt if you already have that but i also want to make sure community college is free and we have more technical education back in our high schools i want us to have more apprenticeships so that more young people get the skills that they can use to fill those jobs in   so i am optimistic and another big area where im optimistic is green renewable energy where were going to be the st century clean energy super power not china not germany the united states of america  so i know we can do this we got ourselves out of the worst financial crash were standing now were going to start running again and we are particularly going to focus on young people who have been left out of education and the job market and middle aged and older people who have lost jobs and need new skills to be able to compete and win again in the job market  and while were doing that were going to start at the very beginning with early childhood education universal prekindergarten because we are stronger together and we need all of our people to feel that theyve got a shot you know even abraham lincoln talked about how important it was     give every american a fair shot in the race of life thats what weve got to get back to its just wrong that some people do well and other people feel like theyre never going to catch up so i want to be a president for not only democrats but republicans and independents too i want to be a president for the struggling the striving and the successful i want to be a president for those who voted for me and those who dont vote for me because we are all in this together  so theres a lot we could do on the economy theres a lot we can do on education theres a lot we could do on healthcare we are going to build on the affordable care act and were going to get the cost of premiums copays and deductibles down and we are going to tackle the high cost of prescription drugs  and we are going to do more to help people deal with mental health and addiction problems  i probably have more people talking to me about mental health and addiction than nearly anything else you know folks talk about the economy they talk about education but when it gets really personal you know im in a coffee shop or talking to folks on a line here and somebody takes my hand and pulls me closer what they talk to me about is mental health and addiction  and shame on us if we dont do more to help people who are suffering and families who are in pain because of that  and we are going to have a national security and foreign policy that america can be proud of we are going to lead the world in accordance with our value in pursuance of our interests and furtherance of our security along with our friends and allies it just absolutely bewilders me when i hear donald trump trying to talk about national security its not just as joe biden said its not just he doesnt know what hes talking about thats bad enough but what he often says hurts us it sends the wrong message to friend and foe alike in the world  and we are living in a complex world one where we need steadiness where weve got to have a real sense of how were going to get where we want to go to help as many people to keep our country safe but to do it with the kind of bigness the kind of confidence that really marks america at our best you know sometimes when i hear trump talking about how we should all be so afraid all the time and then i find a few minutes to watch the olympics i think my goodness you know when you go out and compete not everybody can win but you got to do your best  and can you imagine you know michael phelps or simone biles or all these other great american athletes in the locker rooms well i dont know im too afraid to go out and compete no they get out there they compete they do their best they demonstrate the kind of spirit that we want from all americans  and then finally i think we have to defend the advances and rights that we have made here in america and    i am very proud of our young people this is the most tolerant and generous generation that weve ever seen in america and yes we are going to defend human rights and civil rights and womens rights and gay rights and voter rights and worker rights   because if were going to lift everybody up we need to do it in a way that lets those people feel that their dignity is respected as well and yes i am going to take on the gun lobby to try to save lives here in philadelphia and across pennsylvania    and as i  as i said here in philadelphia in my speech that doesnt mean i want to abolish the second amendment that doesnt mean that i wanna round up peoples guns what that means is i wanna keep you from being shot by somebody who shouldnt have a gun in the first place  we cant let this go on we need comprehensive background checks close the gun show

8,"Clinton","hello  thank you  thank you so much wow oh i  i am so happy to be here it is great being in cleveland thank you all  i want to thank kim bratak  a teacher right here at john marshall for introducing me  and i want to thank all the teachers and educators the staff and the students of john marshall  i am delighted to be here with your mayor mayor frank jackson  also with my longtime friend your former governor candidate for the senate ted strickland  with your county executive county executive budish i know is here somewhere  and with my great friend who did an excellent job presiding over the democratic national convention congresswoman marcia fudge  i always love being here and today is particularly special because i got a tour of this high school  and i first of all want to thank the people of cleveland for investing in a high school that is really all about the future  what a stark contrast this high school poses to what happened here in cleveland during the republican convention because honestly they painted such a bleak negative picture of america i couldnt recognize our country listening to their angry speeches the kind of negative view that they had of our people donald trump saying we never win anymore well tell that to the cavaliers  tell that to our olympic athletes who are cleaning up in rio  there is nothing we cant do if we put our minds to it and thats how i want america to feel about itself and how i want every american to feel and i saw the future  the students and teachers who showed me what theyre doing here in robotics in d design in laser design in entrepreneurial and civic education i for one am really proud of this high school and what it represents for the students here  and why is that so important for those of us who are no longer in high school because weve got to get the economy working for everybody not just those at the top and how are we going to do that well i know that too many families right here in ohio are feeling a lot of financial stress worrying about theyre going to make ends meet dealing with all the costs from childcare to prescription drugs i understand that  thats why i have laid out specific plans about how were going to get the economy working for everyone and i think its important when someone comes to you and asks for your support running for president that maybe they tell you what they want to do so that you can decide who you want to vote for  and sometimes you know i get criticized for doing that people say oh there she goes she has another plan  well i do ive got an infrastructure plan to create millions of jobs fixing our roads our bridges our tunnels our ports our airports our water systems our sewer systems  as part of that plan i want to start a national infrastructure bank so that we have public and private funds working together so we dont just wait on congress to act but we are building rebuilding maintaining all the time and its not just what we can see as important as that is we need a new modern electric grid that can take and distribute clean renewable energy across america  and we need to finally finish the job of connecting every home and business everywhere in america from inner cities to remote rural areas to highspeed broadband access so they can be a part of the st century digital economy  you know i was talking to a group of my friends who are teachers i love teachers thank you all for being here with me  and they were telling me that there had just been a national survey done and the teachers were asked do you ever  you know do you ever assign homework that requires your students to go on the internet and the answer was  percent yes they did now that makes perfect sense if you just saw what i saw you gotta have knowledge of the internet youve got to be able to learn to use it it can spark your imagination create new dreams i met young people i said well what got you interested in computer design d design robots well they were interested in the arts they were interested in what they could do to design and make things so the answer was  percent of teachers but heres the problem  million students   million homes with students in them in america do not have access to the internet and so were already creating a big gap  a homework gap which turns into an achievement gap and doesnt give every kid the chance to go as far as his or her hard work and talent will take them so when i talk about infrastructure im talking about making our economy more competitive and creating more opportunities for more americans willing to work for it because i believe in the basic bargain if youre willing to work you ought to be able to get ahead and stay ahead thats how i was raised and thats what i want americans to believe again  you know this past monday i was in scranton pennsylvania with joe biden  and joe was born in scranton my grandparents my father was born in scranton i went back to scranton every summer lot of christmas holidays my grandfather was an immigrant came as a young child he worked in the scranton lace factory making lace which was a big deal back in those days i remember we used to have lace curtains and lace tablecloths and things like that  and my grandfather worked really hard because he believed that if he worked hard he could provide a better life for his kids and he did my dad got to go to college he went to penn state where he played football and  and he took a job in the midwest as a salesman and then went into the navy during world war ii when he came out he started a small business and he worked really hard and i used to go help him sometimes because he printed fabric for draperies and he had a print plant and he had two long tables and it was you know not a  it was just an old plant  it was low ceiling no windows and he would print that drapery fabric hed take an old fashioned silk screen and hed put it down and hed pour the paint in then take a squeegee and then go from one side to another pick up the screen keep going down the table and he provided a good life i grew up in a suburb of chicago and so i know what the american dream is all about i am proud to be the granddaughter of a factory worker and the daughter of a small businessman and standing here before you  and so when i think about how hard my dad worked and i think about him printing those fabrics and then loading them into his car and delivering them to whoever ordered them and then expecting to be paid because he had done the work it just really hits me personally when people are standing up and telling their stories they were smallbusiness people they were plumbers electricians painters who did work for donald trump and he refused to pay them that violates the basic bargain if you do your job youre supposed to be rewarded for your work not stiffed not told to go sue somebody  and i cant help but take it personally because i think about what would have happened to my family if my father had taken a job like that and put his heart and soul into it bought the material bought the paint did the labor shows up delivers the product and is told were not paying you but person after person small business after small business is telling the same story that they were not paid they were told to go sue donald trump now youre a small business you cant afford lawyers to go sue somebody thats not the way its supposed to work so when i talk about creating new jobs in infrastructure advanced manufacturing clean renewable energy i also talk about creating more small businesses and small businesses that will actually grow and give more people a chance to fulfill their dreams and will be part of the basic bargain who will be paid for the work that they do so they can stay in business  now i got to tell you creating the jobs of the future means weve got to make sure that all americans not just young americans have all the education and all the skills that are needed thats why i want to start with early childhood education so that more young kids get prepared to succeed in school  i want to see more technical education like i saw right here in john marshall across america so that high school students can be better prepared you know when we stopped doing vocational education some years ago we basically sent a message to so many young people theres only one way to be successful in america youve got to go to a four year college  that is so unfair and its also untrue  actually if you look at job projections more than half of the jobs that will be available in america in  will not require a fouryear college degree and so how are we going to get our people prepared were going to bring more technical education not the old fashioned kind but what i saw here at john marshall were going to bring computer coding like i saw in a classroom just a few minutes ago were going to bring engineering and design work were going to give young kids in high school the chance to either get that education right in their own school or go to a community college that will provide it and give them credit to get them credentials an associate degree or credit to go on to a four year college so were going to be more on apprenticeship programs  i want everybody whos willing to work to be prepared i dont want any excuses im a kind of no excuse person if you are willing to do the work i want to make sure weve got an economy that will produce the jobs and then i want to make fouryear college affordable if you go to a fouryear public college or university it should be affordable and were going to make community college free for everybody that wants to go to community college and were going help everybody with student debt pay down the debt get it off their backs now i think  i think its fair to say ok how are you going to do all that thats fair to ask well were going to do it in two ways number one we are going to tax the wealthy who have made all of the income gains in the last  years  the super wealthy corporations wall street theyre going to have to invest in education in skills training in infrastructure because we have to grow this economy we do need to have the resources to do that and ive laid out what i want to do and how i would do it closing the loopholes creating a fairer tax system but ive made very clear im the only candidate who ran in either of the democratic or the republican primary who said from the very beginning i will not raise taxes on the middle class the middle class has to catch up to they were before the great recession  and so ive laid this all out and so independent analysts economists and others are looking at what ive said and what donald trump has said and in fact according to an independent analysis by moodys analytics carried out by the man who was john mccains economic adviser  if you were to implement what i am proposing we would create at least  million new jobs in the first term of my administration  by contrast if you look at what trump is proposing and how he wants to give huge tax breaks to people who are wealthy like him it would cost our economy  million jobs now this is not me saying it this is an independent analysis saying it that has tried to look at this very objectively but what does that mean for ohio  if we divide across the country by population ohio would gain  jobs under my plans and lose more than  jobs under donald trumps plans  and its hard  its not hard to see why because he wants to give tax cuts to big corporations millionaires wall street money managers hes even created a new tax loophole that we call the trump loophole because its really good for trump  it would let millionaires and billionaires cut their tax rate in half on a lot of their income under his plans donald trump would pay a lower tax rate than middleclass families of course we have no idea what tax rate he pays because unlike everybody else whos run for president in the last four or five decades he refuses to release his tax returns so the american people cant really judge  and then theres the estate tax which he wants to eliminate altogether so if you believe donald trump is as wealthy as he claims  we cant say that for sure but lets assume it  he would  by eliminating the estate tax  save the trump family  billion and do absolutely nothing for  percent of all americans now think about what we could do with  billion in ohio we could build  new elementary schools we could eliminate the outstanding student loan of  ohioans  we could provide health care to  veterans  and we could sure rebuild every crumbling bridge in this state and fix a lot of the highways that are causing folks to incur expenses  donald trump doesnt need a tax cut i dont need a tax cut its time for the wealthiest americans whoever you are as well as corporations and wall street to pay your fair share in taxes you have been successful in this country because of everything this country represents were going to stop giving tax breaks to corporations that out source jobs and profits were going to reward those who invest in their employees again if corporations move their headquarters overseas were going to slap an exit tax on them and try to persuade them not to move  were going to add a new tax on multimillionaires crack down on tax gaming and close loopholes and then use that money to make the kind of investments that will grow the economy for everybody so here  heres the bottom line there are just  days left in this election i keep track of them cross them off  and for anyone waiting for donald trump to suddenly become more responsible   remember what a great american maya angelou said when someone shows you who they are believe them  and i  i think its fair to say that donald trump has shown us who he is he can hire and fire anybody he wants from his campaign they can make him read new words from a teleprompter  but he is still the same man who insults gold star families demeans women mocks people with disabilities and thinks he knows more about isis than our generals  there is no new donald trump this is it and you know i hope you will talk to any of your friends who are flirting with the idea of voting for donald trump friends dont let friends vote for trump  so now  now heres what i have to ask all of you im proud that we have run a campaign of issues not insults thats what im going to continue to do for the next  days because i think the details actually matter thats why i sweat the details you know i  i really care a lot about what happens to the young people and the families and our seniors thats why im going to do everything i can to raise the national minimum wage so that it is a living wage  im going to do everything i can to make sure that you have the health care you need at an affordable price  and get the costs of prescription drugs down because they are once again getting out of reach i was at an event the other day and a very distinguished doctor the head of a big hospital in new york he said weve got to do something about prescription drug costs this is not a  not a patient or a family this is one of the most distinguished doctors in new york city he said its getting to the point where i cant prescribe certain drugs that my patients need because the insurance wont pay for them medicare medicaid  nobody will pay for them because they are too expensive and he mentioned particularly a drug by gilead that will cure hepatitis c and it is so expensive that a lot of americans are being left out and you know what really is upsetting about this is that drug company sells that same drug all over the world at a much lower price to everybody else now im proud  im proud that our drug companies invent drugs to cure really terrible diseases and treat chronic diseases im proud of that but lets be clear your tax dollars help support the research that is used to create those drugs in the first place  your tax dollars support the food and drug administration that tests those drugs to determine whether or not they are safe and effective to be able to go to market and then we end up in america paying the highest price for those drugs that we have helped to create we have got to take this on and we can do it without hurting research and discovery and new drugs and new devices  and there are two other issues that i want to mention respecting health because ive been on the campaign trail now for  well about a year and a half ever since april of  so i have talked with and mostly listened to thousands of americans now people talk to me about their jobs they talk to me about education they talk to me about student loans and the high costs of college they talk to me a lot about gun violence they talk to me a lot about the things that are on their minds but the most emotional encounters i have are when families grab my hand and talk to me about mental health and addition  we have got to do a better job we have too many families and too many individual americans whose lives are being either totally undermined or shortened because of mental health and because of addiction so im going to work on those things too as your president because weve got to tackle these two problems  and i also want to defend the rights that americans now have from all of the various attacks that people are waging thats why i  i support human rights and civil rights i support womens rights  and yes i will defend planned parenthood against all of these partisan attacks  i support gay rights  voting rights which are under attack across america including right here in ohio  i support workers rights the right to form and organize a union and bargain collectively  i support the rights of people with disabilities who deserve more chances to be integrated into the economy and society  and yes i will take on the gun lobby and try to get common sense gun safety measures passed  and know  i know  i know how difficult this is but here is what i want to say i want to say what i said at the convention in my speech i am not at all advocating the repeal of the second amendment i am not at all advocating any program that would in any way take peoples guns away here is what im advocating i want to help you stay alive so that nobody who shouldnt have a gun in the first place gets one and hurts you or other people  because when i think about the three big challenges the next president faces getting the economy to work for everybody not just those at the top keeping us safe and leading the world with steadiness and unifying america its not just the job for the president we all have to do our part  and when it comes to keeping americans safe i want to keep you safe in your own communities and your homes from gun violence i want to keep us safe from terrorists no matter where they are from or what they are after  i want to make sure that we keep our alliances strong because i know how important it is that we work together to defeat the terrorist threat and i will bring all the experience i had as a senator serving on the armed services committee as a secretary of state to make sure that america remains the most free the most safe the most important leader in the world  but i also want to unify our country you know i bet if we had the time wed find something that every single one of us disagreed about with everybody else we have different experiences different backgrounds i think thats part of the american dna you know our founders had some big arguments we have a lot of impassioned people who care about the future of our country and what we should do  but at the end of the argument weve got to come together we are the greatest example of freedom and opportunity and justice that the world has ever known and we cant do anything that ever undermines that and thats why it is so important that we seek and find common ground together i did that as a first lady i worked with republicans to create the childrens health insurance program that now covers  million kids  i worked with republicans to reform the adoption and foster care system which i care deeply about  i worked with republicans after  to rebuild new york and to make our country safer to get health care to national guard men and women i worked with every republican i served with just about i worked with republicans as secretary of state we got a new treaty with russia to lower the number of nuclear weapons and that took  votes and we had to get republicans as well as democrats to agree with that  i happen to believe i dont have all the answers i happen to believe we are stronger together in charting a course toward the future  so i need your help stronger together is not just a slogan for our campaign it is what i believe in my heart i will get up everyday in the white house trying to figure out how were going to create more jobs more opportunity keep us safe unify us and thats where you come in i hope you will join this campaign you can do so today by texting join join at  or you can go to hillary clintoncom were hiring organizers in ohio so if your interested in working as an organizer see one of our people who will be at the doors as you leave if this a consequential election i understand a lot of the concerns that many americans have wondering and worrying about our country about their lives about their kids lives about their retirement about the purpose and dignity of their work so i know weve got challenges that we have to address but i am absolutely sure we can do this i believe americas best days are still ahead of us  if you will join this campaign join our cause together we will not just win an election but chart a course of confidence and optimism getting results for the american people come join me please thank you all very much"
9,"Clinton","thank you thank you so much i  i am so thrilled to be back in reno thank you i  i have to say though i know when im here in reno im the other hillary and i am more than ok with that because i think your mayor is doing a terrific job and the fact that she herself is a small businesswoman and committed to really lifting up reno and giving everybody in this great city the biggest little city with a big heart a chance to get ahead and stay ahead i could not be more honored than to have her support and endorsement in this race so thank you so much mayor schieve and let me also thank dr karen hilgersom and everybody here at truckee meadows community college i love community colleges and i know something about what this college is doing to give people of all ages  not just young people  a real chance to get the skills and opportunities that everybody in america deserves so thank you now i have to i have to begin by saying my original plan for this visit was to focus on our agenda to help small businesses and entrepreneurs this week we proposed new steps to cut red tape and taxes to make it easier for small businesses to get the credit they need to grow and hire i want to be a small business president my father was a small businessman and i believe that in america if you can dream it you should be able to build it and so well be talking a lot more about small business and about our economic plans in the days and weeks ahead but today here in this community college devoted to opening minds and creating a great understanding of the world in which we live i want to address something that i am hearing about from americans all over our country everywhere i go people tell me how concerned they are by the divisive rhetoric coming from my opponent in this election and i i understand that concern because its like nothing weve heard before from a nominee for president of the united states from one of our two major parties from the start donald trump has built his campaign on prejudice and paranoia he is taking hate groups mainstream and helping a radical fringe take over the republican party his disregard for the values that make our country great is profoundly dangerous  in just this past week under the guise of outreach to africanamericans trump has stood up in front of largely white audiences and described black communities in such insulting and ignorant terms poverty rejection horrible education no housing no homes no ownership crime at levels nobody has seen right now he said you can walk down the street and get shot those are his words but when i hear them i think to myself how sad donald trump misses so much he doesnt see the success of black leaders in every field the vibrancy of blackowned businesses the strength of the black church he doesnt see   he doesnt see the excellence of historically black colleges and universities or the pride of black parents watching their children thrive he apparently didnt see police chief brown of dallas on television after the murders of five of his officers conducting himself with such dignity he certainly doesnt have any solutions to take on the reality of systemic racism and create more equity and opportunity in communities of color and for every american it really does take a lot of nerve to ask people hes ignored and mistreated for decades what do you have to lose because the answer is everything now trumps lack of knowledge or experience or solutions would be bad enough but what hes doing here is more sinister trump is reinforcing harmful stereotypes and offering a dog whistle to his most hateful supporters its a disturbing preview of what kind of president hed be and thats what i want to make clear today a man with a long history of racial discrimination who traffics in dark conspiracy theories drawn from the pages of supermarket tabloids and the far dark reaches of the internet should never run our government our command our military  ask yourself if he doesnt respect all americans how can he serve all americans now i  i know that some people still want to give trump the benefit of the doubt they hope that he will eventually reinvent himself that theres a kinder gentler more responsible donald trump waiting in the wings somewhere because after all it is hard to believe anyone let alone a nominee for president could really believe all the things he says but heres the hard truth there is no other donald trump this is it and maya angelou a great american whom i admired very much she once said when someone shows you who they are believe them the first time well throughout his career and this campaign donald trump has shown us exactly who it who he is and i think we should believe him when he was getting his start in business he was sued by the justice department for refusing to rent apartments to black and latino tenants their applications would be marked with a c c for colored and then rejected three years later the justice department took trump back to court because he hadnt changed and the pattern continued through the decades state regulators fined one of trumps casinos for repeatedly removing black dealers from the floor no wonder the turnover rate for his minority employees was way above average and lets not forget that trump first gained political prominence leading the charge for the socalled birthers he promoted the racist lie that president obama is not really an american citizen part of a sustained effort to delegitimize americas first black president  and in  trump launched his own campaign for president with another racist lie he described mexican immigrants as rapists and criminals and he accused the mexican government of actively sending them across the border none of that is true and oh by the way   by the way mexicos not paying for his wall either  if he ever tries to get it built the american taxpayer will pay for it well be stuck with the bill but there has been a steady stream of bigotry coming from him i think we all remember when trump said a distinguished federal judge born in indiana could not be trusted to do his job because quote hes a mexican think about that the man who today is the standard bearer of the republican party said a federal judge who by the way had a distinguished record as a us attorney had to go in hiding because mexican drug gangs were after him who has mexican heritage but just like me was born in this country is somehow incapable solely because of his heritage even the republican speaker of the house of representatives paul ryan described that and i quote as the textbook definition of a racist comment and to this day  to this day trump has never apologized to judge curiel but for trump that is just par for the course this is someone who retweets white supremacists online like the user who goes by the name white genocide tm trump took this fringe bigot with a few dozen followers and spread his message to  million people his campaign famously posted an antisemitic image a star of david imposed over a sea of dollar bills that first appeared on white supremacist websites the trump campaign has also selected a prominent white national  nationalist leader as a delegate in california and they only dropped him under pressure when asked in a nationally televised interview whether he would disavow the support of david duke a former grand wizard of the ku klux klan trump wouldnt do it and only later again under mounting pressure did he backtrack and when trump was asked about anti semitic slurs and death threats coming from his supporters he refused to condemn them through it all he has continued pushing discredited conspiracy theories with racist undertones you remember he said that thousands of american muslims in new jersey cheered the  attacks they didnt he suggested the senator ted cruzs father was involved in the kennedy assassination now perhaps in trumps mind because mr cruz was a cuban immigrant he must have had something to do with it and there is absolutely of course no evidence of that just recently trump claimed that president obama founded isis and he has repeated that over and over again his latest paranoid fever dream is about my health and all i can say is donald dream on   but  but my friend     but my friend this is what happens when you treat the national enquirer like gospel they said in october id be dead in six months its also what happens when you listen to the radio host alex jones who claims that  and the oklahoma city bombings were inside jobs  he even said and this really just is so disgusting he even said the victims of the sandy hook massacre were child actors and no one was actually killed there i dont know what happens in somebodys mind or how dark their heart must be to say things like but trump doesnt challenge these lies he actually went on jones show and said your reputation is amazing i will not let you down this from the man who wants to be president of the united states you know ive stood by president obamas side as he made the toughest decisions a commanderinchief has to make in times of crisis our country depends on steady leadership clear thinking calm judgment because one wrong move can mean the difference between life and death i know we have veterans here and i know we have families mothers and spouses and children of people currently serving the last thing we need in the situation room is a loose cannon who cant tell the difference  or doesnt care to  between fact and fiction and who buys so easily into racially tinged rumors  someone so detached from reality should never be in charge of making decisions that are as real as they come and that is yet another reason why donald trump is simply temperamentally unfit to be president of the untied states  now i  i hear and i read some people who are saying well that  his bluster and is bigotry is  is just overheated campaign rhetoric an outrageous person saying outrageous things for attention but look at his policies the ones that trump has proposed  they would put prejudice into practice and dont be distracted by his latest efforts to muddy the waters he may have some new people putting new words in his mouth but we know where he stands he would form a deportation force to round up millions of immigrants and kick them out of the country hed abolish the bed rock constitutional principle that says if youre born in the united states youre an american citizen he says that children born to undocumented parents in america are anchor babies and should be deported millions of them hed ban muslims around the world from entering our country just because of their religion now think about that for a minute how would that actually work the people landing in us airports would line up to get their passports stamped  just like they do now but in trumps america when they step up to the counter the immigration officer would ask every single person what is your religion and then what what is someone says im a christian but the agent doesnt believe him do they have to prove it how would they do that really ever since the pilgrims landed on plymouth rock america has distinguished itself as a haven for people fleeing religious persecution believing in religious freedom and religious liberty  under donald trump america would distinguish itself as the only country in the world to impose a religious test at the border now come to think of it there actually maybe one other place that does that the so called islamic state the territory that isis controls what a cruel irony that someone running for president would equate us with them now but dont worry some will say as president trump will be surrounded by smart advisors who will rein in his worst impulses so when a tweet gets under his skin and he wants to retaliate with a cruise missile maybe cooler heads will convince him not to well maybe but look at who hes put in charge of his campaign  trump likes to say he only hires the best people but hes had to fire so many campaign managers its like an episode from the apprentice  and the latest shake up was designed to quote let trump be trump so to do that he hired stephen bannon the head of a right wing website called breitbartcom as the campaigns ceo now to give you a flavor of his work here are a few headlines that theyve published and im not making this up birth control makes women unattractive and crazy would you rather your child had feminism or cancer gabby giffords the gun control movements human shield hoist it high and proud the confederate flag proclaims a glorious heritage and that one came shortly after the charleston massacre when democrats and republicans alike were doing everything they could to heal racial divides that breitbart and bannon tried to inflame just imagine donald trump reading that and thinking this is what i need more of in my campaign now bannon has nasty things to say about pretty much everyone this spring he railed against speaker paul ryan for quote rubbing his socialjustice catholicism in my nose every second no wonder hes gone to work for trump the only presidential candidate ever to get into a public feud with the pope its truly hard to believe but according to the southern poverty law center which tracks hate groups breitbart embraces ideas on the extremist fringe of the conservative right this is not conservatism as we have known it this is not republicanism as we have known it these are racist ideas racebaiting ideas antimuslim anti immigrant antiwoman all key tenants making up an emerging racist ideology known as the altright now altright is short for alternativeright the wall street journal describes it as a loose but organized movement mostly online that rejects mainstream conservatism promotes nationalism and views immigration and multiculturalism as threats to white identity so the de facto merger between breitbart and the trump campaign represents a landmark achievement for this group a fringe element has effectively taken over the republican party and this is part of a broader story  the rising tide of hardline rightwing nationalism around the world just yesterday one of britains most prominent rightwing leaders nigel farage who stoked antiimmigrant sentiments to win the referendum to have britain leave the european union campaigned with donald trump in mississippi  farage has called for a bar on the children of legal immigrants from public schools and health services he has said women are  and i quote  worth less than men and he supports scrapping laws that prevent employers from discriminating based on race thats who donald trump wants by his side when he is addressing an audience of american voters and the grandgodfather of this global brand of extreme nationalism is russian president vladimir putin in fact farage has appeared regularly on russian propaganda programs now hes standing on the same stage as the republican nominee trump himself heaps praise on putin and embraces prorussian policies he talks casually of abandoning our nato allies recognizing russias annexation of crimea giving the kremlin a free hand in eastern europe american presidents from truman to reagan to bush to clinton to obama have rejected the kind of approach trump is taking on russia and we should too  all of this adds up to something weve never seen before of course theres always been a paranoid fringe in our politics a lot of it arising racial resentment but its never had the nominee of a major party stoking it encouraging it and giving it a national megaphone until now on david dukes radio show the other day the mood was jubilant we appear to have taken over the republican party one white supremacist said duke laughed no theres still more work to do he replied so no one should have any illusions about whats really going on here the names may have changed racists now call themselves racialists white supremacists now call themselves white nationalists the paranoid fringe now calls itself altright but the hate burns just as bright now trump is trying to rebrand himself as well but dont be fooled theres an old mexican proverb that says tell me with whom you walk and i will tell you who you are so we know who trump is  a few words on a teleprompter wont change that he says he wants to make america great again but more and more it seems as though his real message seems to be make america hate again and this isnt just about one election its about who we are as a nation its about the kind of example we want to set for our children and our grandchildren next time you see trump on tv think about all the children listening across america kids hear a lot more than we think parents and teachers are already worrying about what they call the trump effect they report that bullying and harassment are on the rise in our schools especially targeting students of color muslims and immigrants at a recent high school basketball game in indiana white students held up trump signs and taunted latino players on the opposing team with chants of build the wall and speak english after a similar incident in iowa one frustrated school principal said they see it in a presidential campaign and now its ok for everyone to say this we wouldnt tolerate this kind of behavior before and we wouldnt tolerate it in our homes and we should not stand for it from a presidential candidate  my friends this is a moment of reckoning for every republican dismayed that the party of lincoln has become the party of trump its a moment of reckoning for all of us who love our country and believe that america is better than this twenty years ago when bob dole accepted the republican nomination he pointed to the exits in the convention hall and told any racist in the party to get out the week after  george w bush went to a mosque and declared for everyone to hear that muslims love america just as much as i do in  john mccain told his own supporters that they were wrong about the man he was trying to defeat senator mccain made sure they knew barrack obama he said was an american citizen and a decent person we need that kind of leadership again  we can have our disagreements and believe me i understand that i think thats healthy we need good debates but we need to do it in a respectful way not fingerpointing and blaming and stirring up this bigotry and prejudice every day more americans are standing up and saying enough is enough including republicans and i am honored to have their support in this campaign  and i promise you this with your help i will be a president for democrats republicans and independents for those who vote for me and for those who vote against me i will be a president for all americans  because i truly believe we are stronger together and this is a vision for the future rooted in our values and reflected in a rising generation of young people the young people in america today are the most open diverse and connected generation we have ever seen  how many of you saw any of the olympics right  i was  i was so proud i always get carried away every time the olympics are on and you look at the diversity of our athletes look at our fabulous olympic team representing the united states of america  ibtihaj muhammad an african american muslim from new jersey won the bronze medal in fencing with grace and skill  would she even have a place in donald trumps america and ill tell you when i was growing up in so many parts of our country simone manuel and katie ledecky would not have been allowed to swim in the same public pool and now together on our swimming team theyre winning olympic medals as teammates  i dont know about you but i dont think we have a person to waste we want to build an america where everyone has a place where if you work hard and you do your part you can get ahead and stay ahead thats a basic bargain of america and we cannot get to where we need to be unless we move forward together and stand up against prejudice and paranoia and prove again that america is great because america is good thank you all so very much lets go out and win the election god bless you and god bless the united states of america"
10,"Clinton","good afternoon i am delighted to have this great honor of being here and having this opportunity to address you i want to thank the national commander  thank you commander barnett i want to thank verna jones your executive director and dewey mothe   commander and i want to thank a longtime friend and adviser to me someone whom i am very grateful to and that is your national treasurer george buskirk most of all thanks to you all the legionnaires here and across america thanks for your service in our armed forces you wore the uniform you took an oath you put your life on the line to protect the greatest country on earth  there are some who may argue with that but not around me  when you came home you joined the american legion and by doing so you kept serving just look at what the legion does you care for wounded warriors you help raise the next generation of american patriots i want to give a special shout out to boys nation which meant so much to my husband when he was growing up and when i told him i was coming here today he said youve got to mention boys nation i told him i would but i also have to mention girls nation too  i want to thank your auxiliary the worlds largest womens patriotic service organization  i was honored to receive the auxiliarys public spirit award in  and i have great admiration for the work you do as a daughter of a veteran as a proud american i am grateful to you all now im not going to talk a lot about politics today but i do want to say this whoever america elects this fall wont just be our next president that person will be our next commander in chief and every person in this room understands how great a responsibility that is now i know some of you are democrats and some of you are republicans and some of you are independents i suppose there are some of you whove never voted for a democrat before i get that my dad was a rock red republican but i learned at our dinner table that we can disagree without being disagreeable  i want you to know if i am fortunate enough to win this election i will be a president for democrats republicans independents for people who vote for me for people who dont for all americans that is what i think we need we need to unify our country and go forward into the future with confidence and optimism  today i want you to know a little bit about where i stand and how i see the world and americas place in it i spent four years as your secretary of state eight years before that as senator from the great state of new york six years on the senate armed services committee if theres one core belief that has guided and inspired me every step of the way it is this the united states is an exceptional nation i believe we are still lincolns last best hope of earth were still reagans shining city on a hill were still robert kennedys great unselfish compassionate country and its not just that we have the greatest military or that our economy is larger than any on earth its also the strength of our values the strength of the american people everyone who works harder dreams bigger and never ever stops trying to make our country and the world a better place and part of what makes america an exceptional nation is that we are also an indispensable nation in fact we are the indispensable nation people all over the world look to us and follow our lead my friends we are so lucky to be americans it is an extraordinary blessing its why so many people from so many places want to be americans too but its also a serious responsibility the decisions we make and the actions we take even the actions we dont take affect millions even billions of lives  you know that youve seen it now all of this may seem evident especially to men and women who have worn the uniform you may wonder how anyone could disagree but in fact my opponent in this race has said very clearly that he thinks american exceptionalism is insulting to the rest of the world in fact when vladimir putin of all people criticized american exceptionalism my opponent agreed with him saying and i quote if youre in russia you dont want to hear that america is exceptional well maybe you dont want to hear it but that doesnt mean its not true my opponent misses something important when we say america is exceptional it doesnt mean that people from other places dont feel deep national pride just like we do it means that we recognize americas unique and unparalleled ability to be a force for peace and progress a champion for freedom and opportunity our power comes with a responsibility to lead humbly thoughtfully and with a fierce commitment to our values because when america fails to lead we leave a vacuum that either causes chaos or other countries or networks rush in to fill the void so no matter how hard it gets no matter how great the challenge america must lead the question is how we lead what kind of ideas strategies and tactics we bring to our leadership american leadership means standing with our allies because our network of allies is part of what makes us exceptional no other country in the world has alliances like ours russia and china have nothing close we stand with our allies because generations of american troops fought and died to secure those bonds and because they deliver for us every day our allies share intelligence on terrorists they provide staging areas for our military so we can respond quickly to events on the other side of the world other nations soldiers sailors airmen and marines often fight side by side with ours some of you may have served and fought alongside men and women from other countries you say them in action you know how important these bonds are to our security threatening to walk away from our alliances ignoring the importance that they still are to us is not only wrong its dangerous if im  if im your president our friends will always know america will have your backs and we expect you to have ours american leadership means bringing the world together to solve global problems as only we can the united states built the international coalition against isis now were working with partners to take back territory and defeat them without getting drawn in to a ground war we brought the world together to impose sanctions on iran and secure a deal that puts a lid on irans nuclear program without firing a single shot you dont build a coalition by insulting our friends or acting like a loose cannon you do it by putting in the slow hard work of building relationships getting countries working together was my job every day as your secretary of state its more than a photo op it takes consistency and reliability  actually its just like building personal relationships people have to get to know that they can count on you that you wont say one thing one day and something totally different the next and it certainly takes more than trying to make up for a year of insults and insinuations by dropping in on our neighbors for a few hours and then flying home again that is not how it works american leadership means leading with our values in pursuance of our interests in protection of our security at our best the united states is the global force for freedom justice and human dignity we celebrate our diversity  as a source of national strength just look at our armed forces which represents all races religions ethnicities and yes immigrants from other countries all fighting for the red white and blue we stand up to regimes that abuse human rights we stand up for religious and ethnic minorities for women for people with disabilities and we comport ourselves with honor theres no better proof of that than what our navy seals did during the raid to kill osama bin laden  i was deeply honored to be part of that small group advising the president i brought to those discussions my experience as a senator from new york on  and my commitment to do whatever i could in whatever role i had to bring bin laden to justice youve all seen the picture of us crowded into the smaller situation room watching the video screen every second counted one of the copters misgauged how high the wall was around the courtyard clipped the tail getting disabled it didnt stop the seals from rushing out getting into the compound returning fire against bin ladens body guards taking on his adult son and finally bin laden himself but the seals knew that they had to destroy the helicopter before they left i was holding my breath through the entire operation because at anytime pakistani soldiers could have arrived this compound was in a military garrisoned city actually the home of their military academy so yes every second counted but still our seals took the time to move the women and children bin ladens family members to safety before destroying the helicopter that is what honor looks like that is america at our best  maybe the soldiers of other nations wouldnt have bothered or maybe theyd have taken revenge on those family members of terrorists but that is not who we are and anyone who doesnt understand that doesnt understand what makes our nation great and let me say something else about american greatness theres no question we face real threats and real enemies that we need to confront and defeat but my opponent is wrong when he says america is no longer great consider the record of the past either years  in  our global economy was collapsing osama bin laden was plotting we had more than  troops fighting two wars iran was racing toward a nuclear weapon many of our allies were less supportive of american leadership than they had been in decades look where we are now we have pulled the global economy out of freefall thanks to the hard work and sacrifice of the american people we have redeployed well over  troops from iraq and afghanistan so they can go home rest and train for future contingencies we cut off irans path to a nuclear weapon we convinced russia to reduce their nuclear weapons arsenal we protected our ally israel and we brought osama bin laden to justice we did that we americans did all of that working together across party lines and there is no question we have more work to do but lets be clear  we are stronger together and it will be my goal if i am fortunate enough to be your president to bring people back together again to set our goals and move forward to achieve them  i know that we cant cozy up to dictators we have to stand up to them we cant contain isis we must defeat them and we will we will do whatever is necessary for as long as it takes to bring them to justice and end their reign of terror once and for all this election is about how to make things better now make no mistake i believe we do have better days ahead but things could also get worse if more countries get nuclear weapons if we abandon our allies if our commanderinchief orders our military to break the laws and commit torture or murder terrorists family members that is why it is so critical we get this right and let me underscore what i have said throughout this campaign we must only send our troops into harms way as a last resort not a first choice that must be our bedrock principle  but we must be able to act decisively on our own when we need to i completely reject anyone including my opponent who calls the american military and i quote a disaster that is an insult to the men and women serving today and all who have served before who put their lives on the line its just not true we do have more work to do to continue to have the strongest most effective military in the world i know this is something that matters a great deal to everyone in this room and here is what we have to do we cannot lose our military edge and that means giving the pentagon the stable predictable funding it needs to make smart investments  youve heard of a sequester the arbitrary caps that congress has imposed on our entire government for the past several years look i am all for cutting the fat out of the budget and making sure we stretch our dollars i am proud of the fact that when my husband left office we had a balanced budget and a surplus and i hope that someday we can get back to doing that but we cannot impose arbitrary limits on something as important as our military that makes no sense at all the sequester makes our country less secure lets end it and get a budget deal that supports americas military our families and our country and lets make reform a priority so that the defense department spends its budget on the right things and by the way the last thing we need is a president who brings more namecalling and temper tantrums to washington weve got to get people listening to each other again getting both parties actually to work together  lets modernize our army and marines our navy and air force our coast guard we need to respond to evolving threats from states like russia china iran and north korea from networks criminal and terrorist networks like isis we need a military that is ready and agile so it can meet the full range of threats and operate on short notice across every domain not just land sea air and space but also cyberspace well invest in new technology so new breakthroughs can transform our military just as stealth precision weapons and advance communications did in the past well make a renewed push to reduce the worlds nuclear weapons because that does make us all safer and well step up our efforts to secure nuclear material around the world and stop terrorists from acquiring or using weapons of mass destruction one of the first things i will do as president is to call for a new nuclear posture review we have to make sure that americas arsenal is prepared to meet future threats well invest in the next frontier of military engagement protecting us interests in outer space and cyberspace youve seen reports russias hacked into a lot of things chinas hacked into a lot of things russia even hacked into the democratic national committee maybe even some state election systems so weve got to step up our game make sure we are well defended and able to take the fight to those who go after us as president i will make it clear that the united states will treat cyber attacks just like any other attack we will be ready with serious political economic and military responses and were going to invest in protecting our governmental networks and our national infrastructure i want us to lead the world in setting the rules of cyberspace if america doesnt others will so in short we have to be ready to win todays fights and tomorrows but you know that the most important thing isnt the size of our military or the sophistication of our weapons the most important thing is our people the men and women who put on the uniform and serve we need to  we need to take a hard look at our militarys personnel policies to make sure we are doing everything to attract and keep the best and the brightest who volunteer we need to support not only them but also their families and as president i will never forget the debt we owe to our veterans and your families who also served i will never ever disrespect gold star families whove made the ultimate sacrifice for our nation  or prisoners of war who endured so much in our name  to insult them is just so wrong and it says a lot about the person doing the insulting in the senate i worked with republicans to increase the benefit paid to gold star families to expand access to military health insurance to make sure all members of the guard and reserves and their families have access to health benefits whether theyre deployed or training at home i fought successfully to amend the  defense appropriations act to establish a training program for family caregivers helping loved ones with traumatic brain injuries senator john mccain and i joined forces to personally raise money for a state of the art rehab facility at brooke army medical center in san antonio to help seriously wounded service members coming home from iraq and afghanistan like you i was outraged by the scandals at va hospitals people waiting for months or years for wheelchairs and basic medications some even dying while waiting for an appointment i know that you heard from secretary mcdonald and i know how hard he and his team are working we are going to build a st century department of veterans affairs that delivers worldclass care and we are not going to let anyone privatize the va were going to reform and strengthen it not privatize it  we will ensure access to timely quality care for all of our veterans improve care for women who are often underserved identify and treat all wounds of war visible and invisible including agent orange and gulf war syndrome and traumatic brain injury and ptsd we will end the epidemic of veteran suicides by expanding access to mental health care and fighting the stigma that isolates too many of our veterans from getting the care that they need  i feel passionately about this because i have looked into the eyes of too many family members who have lost their loved one to suicide thats why just two days ago when i released my plan to improve mental health services for all americans i included a specific section about more help for veterans and their families because we know too many arent getting the help they need right now weve got to serve them just as they served us we are also going to help more veterans looking for jobs with expanded tax credits for businesses that hire veterans more support to veterans who want to start their own businesses and making it easier for veterans to get credit for the skills they learned while serving  and we will crack down on forprofit schools and companies that prey on or discriminate against service members veterans or military families they should be ashamed of themselves and were going to hold them accountable we will also work closely with the american legion to clean up and expedite the appeals process benefits should be delivered as quickly as possible and appeals should be decided as expeditiously as possible i thank you for the work you are doing on that now a lot of what i have mentioned has support from democrats and republicans maintaining our military and caring for our veterans should never be a partisan issue defending american exceptionalism should always be above politics but this is not a normal election the debates are not the normal disagreements between republicans and democrats so i hope you will listen carefully to what my opponent and i propose consider our plans and the values behind them and after youve given us both a fair hearing i hope you will join the growing number of americans democrats republicans and independents who are supporting our vision for the kind of future that we want for our country this election shouldnt be about ideology its not just about differences over policy it truly is about who has the experience and the temperament to serve as president and commanderinchief just three weeks ago  republican national security experts who served in prior republican administrations wrote a letter saying that they will not vote for donald trump because he would be in their words the most reckless president in american history  by contrast i am deeply honored to have so many retired military leaders backing me along with these republican experts im supported by people on both sides of the aisle and both sides of the debates that have defined our foreign policy for the last  years they know i believe in a bipartisan foreign policy they know i believe we should be finding ways to bring our country together around national security our role in the world our values they know they can count on me to do that and what matters to them is that we make the right choice in november  the stakes this fall are as high as any election in our lifetimes so im going to keep raising these issues keep telling people where i stand laying out plans for what id do if elected i have to tell you it is a little funny to me i get criticized for having so many plans people say oh there she goes with another plan about mental health about veterans well i have this old fashioned idea if im asking for your vote for president i should tell you what i want to do as your president so yes i have laid out plans and im going to work my heart out to implement those plans and if i win this fall no one will work harder for our troops our veterans and our military families this is personal to me starting with my dad his name was hugh rodham he enlisted in the navy shortly after pearl harbor he became a chief petty officer at great lakes north of chicago responsible for training thousands of young sailors before they shipped out to sea mostly to the pacific theater after my dad died i received letters from men who had served under him i treasure them to this day my father told me how emotional he got when he accompanied his trainees to the west coast and saw those young sailors get onboard their ships he knew some of them wouldnt survive but he believed in their cause he believed in them and they went to serve to protect our country they knew their country needed them over the course of the last years ive also had the privilege of working with helping and supporting so many active duty and retired military members and families first as first lady then as senator then as secretary of state whenever i would go anywhere representing you and be privileged to meet with the men and women who serve our country i would sit down if we had a chance and hear what was on their minds would shake hands and take pictures sometimes bring messages back to their loved ones and i too knew that some of those young men and women wouldnt be coming home either its that kind of courage and honor that our men and women in uniform demonstrate every single day  i will never forget that and i would expect the american legion to be my partner in the white house to make sure i never do you and all our veterans deserve nothing less our respect our thanks but you also disserve a country that honors your service not just with words but with deeds thats why the american legion is so critical working everyday to make sure america lives up to that standard i will be doing that work right alongside you if i am given the great honor to serve as your president and commander in chief thank you all god bless you and god bless the united states of america thank you    thank you"
11,"Clinton","hey cleveland happy happy labor day  when we were trying to figure out where we could be we all said lets go to cleveland  and i want to thank congresswoman marcia fudge for hosting us    i havent talked so every time i think about trump i get allergic  boy we have  days to go   well thank you well  well you just heard the next vice president didnt you  in addition to thanking marcia fudge let me also thank your great senator sherrod brown also  excuse me also two other great members of congress tim ryan and joyce beatty  and your mayor thanks to mayor jackson  and i hope  i hope that ohio will send ted strickland to the senate  now behind me are some of the great labor leaders of our country  randi weingarten   lee saunders   rich trumka  im proud to be on the same stage with them because theyre always fighting for working families now once i get over my allergic reaction   let me say that we are here in part because we know how important this election is to ohio its not just as tim said  that ohio is one of the battleground states you hear about every four years its that ohio represents everything thats great about america and all of the challenges and the opportunities that we face thats why this election is critical to every person in this state and what i want to emphasize is i know we cant face our problems alone we have to work together we believe we are stronger together and that is in stark contrast to donald trump remember what he said at his convention he said i alone can fix it now think about what that leaves out my friends that leaves out all of our troops on the front lines it leaves out our police officers and firefighters who run toward danger it leaves out doctors and nurses who care for us it leaves out teachers and educators who care for the most important people in our lives our children it leaves out everybody except him and when he says i alone can fix it that clearly demonstrates he doesnt understand how america works how we got great and why we are great today and what we need to do together to face the future because our campaign is about we will fix it together we will work together we will bring our country together  and what better example of that are our labor unions they are built   on the principle of solidarity they look out for each other they fight for fair wages and collective bargaining for safe working conditions just last week we learned once again because another study came out that confirms what we already knew when more workers are in unions wages are higher and not just for union members but for all workers  thats why if tim and i are elected were going to say no to attacks on unions no to rolling back collective bargaining no to unfair trade deals like tpp no to pension cuts that deny you the secure retirement that youve earned no to right to work because right to work is wrong for workers and wrong for america  but were not just about saying no were going to say yes to standing up for workers rights and dignity yes to good jobs and benefits yes to the american dream it is big enough for everyone to share the promise  and so thats why during this campaign i have been running a campaign based on issues not insults  i believe anyone who asks for your vote should tell you what theyre going to do starting tomorrow you can read about the plans tim and i have because were putting out a book did somebody have a copy of that book hey somebody back there you got a copy of the book i can show the crowd were putting out a book called stronger together  thats more than a slogan for the campaign thats a guiding principle for the future we want to build and thats exactly what were going to do now some people say wait a minute youve got so many plans well youre right i do have plans you know why because i want you to know what i want to do to help you and what kind of results were going to work to achieve i have this oldfashioned idea that if youre asking somebody to vote for you they ought to tell you what they want to do and then hold you accountable when you get elected  and ill tell you what our plans start with a very simple idea that were going to get the economy to work for everyone not just those at top were going to do it with the biggest investment in new jobs that weve had since world war ii more infrastructure jobs advanced manufacturing jobs clean renewable energy jobs anyone willing to work hard should have a job that can support them and their families a job with dignity with only a future to be proud of not to worry about were also going to offer new solutions for families families are different today than they were in the s for heavens sakes so we need to make sure we help support families the way they are today not way back when helping people support and balance family and work with paid family leave earned sick days affordable childcare  and finally guaranteeing equal pay for womens work  and here is our book its called strong together for a reason you can read about what we want to do on the economy and everything else it will be available starting tomorrow because the choice for families has never been clearer just look at donald trumps track record when it comes to hardworking men and women i know im allergic to it too but we have to look at his record there are many people you know who are thinking about voting for him and you know friends dont let friends vote for trump  and here is what you can tell among many things he hired a unionbusting firm to break up and organizing campaign at his hotel in las vegas he built his career on refusing to pay workers plumbers painters glass installers marble installers people who did work for him and then he refused to pay them he stiffs small businesses like my dad my dad and tims dad had really small businesses that gave us a good middleclass life i am just so grateful my father never got a contract from donald trump  my dad worked hard he printed drapery fabrics and i would go help him sometimes thered be a long table in his print plant and the fabric would be rolled out and then the silk screens would be laid down and then you pour the paint in then you take the squeegee you push it across the screen you lift it up you go all the way down and you go to the second table all the way back then when he finished hed load those drapery fabrics into his car and deliver them i dont know what would have happened to my family if he had done a big job thinking it was a good deal for trump and he gets there and the trump people say were not going to pay you and then after harassing maybe they say ok well pay you  cents on the dollar he has driven hardworking people into bankruptcy and taken six bankruptcies himself now here in ohio you know very much that a president makes decisions that affect peoples lives and livelihoods when millions of jobs were on the line in the auto industry president obama made the right decision to save the auto industry  i know weve got some uaw members here  i was proud to support them then im even prouder now that the auto industry just had its best year ever  think how differently things could have turned out i know this is hard to imagine if it had been donald trump in the oval office last year  remember this last year he said it didnt matter whether or not we save the auto industry either way would have been acceptable he said we could have just let it go never mind the  people in ohio and millions more across the country whose jobs and paychecks were tied to the auto industry now what else could we expect from someone whose most famous words are youre fired this is the kind of difference that this election really poses people like tim and me who want to create more good jobs with rising wages and benefits for everybody willing to work hard thats the basic bargain of america and somebody who stiffed people to bankruptcy and laid off people one of his bankruptcies put  people out of work every time you hear him talk about how he knows how to create jobs just look at the facts educate yourself and your friends and your colleagues because the kind of bluster and wild claims that he makes about everybody and everything dont stand up to any scrutiny the same is true when it comes to whether we keep our country safe stronger together means working with our allies and our partners right  were not just electing a president were electing a commanderinchief so when donald trump says and i quote i know more about isis than the generals do when he claims as he has that our armed forces are a disaster or he insults a gold star family thats not just wrong and offensive thats dangerous our military is a national treasure and a president must respect the men and women who risk their lives and wear the uniform of our country  some of you know tim kaines son is deployed right now hes a marine  tim and i will not only respect our men and women in uniform we will protect them and we will ensure that they are given the resources that they need to do the dangerous missions we ask them to do on our behalf last week we saw even more evidence that trump is temperamentally unfit and totally unqualified to be president in just a few hours he managed to turn his trip to mexico into an embarrassing international incident he even got into a twitter war with the president of mexico and then he delivered his most hatefilled hard hard line speech yet  doubling down on his absurd plans to send a deportation force to roundup  million people to deport them now you cant make this stuff up can you he can try to distract with divisive dangerous rhetoric he could try to fool voters into thinking somehow hes not as harsh and inhumane as he seems but its too late when you see what he has said and done in this campaign when you see that he cant even go to a foreign country without getting into a public feud with the president i think the answer is clear donald trump does not have the temperament to be our commanderinchief  imagine him in a real crisis ive said it before and i believe it  a man you can bait with a tweet cannot be trusted with nuclear weapons  now look i know that these elections are always tight and hard i am not taking anybody anywhere for granted thats why were here today because we need your help we need to make sure we have an election that validates the kind of positive future that will make life better for the people of ohio and empty promises and raises to tax will do that it wont get your family a job it wont keep our troops safe it wont heal the divides in america ive spent my life fighting for kids and families during the fight for health reforms some of you remember powerful interest blocked our way but i didnt give up i turned around i worked with republicans and democrats to help pass the childrens health insurance program that covers  million kids today  thats how you deliver real results you cant get discouraged you cant give up you can never quit but you got to start from the right values and principles youve got to believe in our country youve got to believe in the american people  im asking for your help in these next two months im asking you to reach out to your friends your neighbors your family  everybody you can possibly touch im asking you to join this campaign you can go to hillaryclintoncom or you could text join join to  because we want to win ohio  but you know we dont want to just win it for the sake of winning it we want to win it so that we can go onto the white house next january and get to work for you  we want to win it so we can take all the plans and all the ideas that will improve your lives that will get the economy working for everybody not just those at the top which will help make education affordable so college is within reach of everyone and help you pay back your student debt we want to defeat isis keep our alliances strong we want to break down the barriers that hold any american back thats why were running were not running because its a nice thing to do after you have a reality tv show right were running because between tim and i we have a lot of years  a lot of years of public service and we believe in what we can do together and we believe that we can make our country even greater so please join the campaign be part of us having an american future that is better than the past that creates the opportunities for every single man woman and child thank you and god bless you"

to be here with three great union leaders people who i admire and really appreciate the chance to work with and look forward to working with as president the uaw president international dennis williams ibew international president lonnie stephenson and of course president of the nea for the educators lily eskelsen  now each of these leaders are pretty special people and i think you know doug was pretty happy that theyre here he told me weve got three international presidents here and i said knowing these three theyre happy to be here this is not some kind of labor day obligation they are with their members theyre working on behalf not only of those in the union but we know it was just proven again last week that unions not only raise incomes and provide benefits for union members but because of unions everybody is better off and thats a message im going to talk about every single day in this campaign  now this is such a beautiful day and you all came out here to celebrate labor day with all of us and i am thrilled that i have a chance to just say a few words i really believe we are stronger together that was the theme of our convention and coming out tomorrow tim kaine and i have a book called stronger together and ill tell you why we did this book i think if you run for president you ought to tell people what you want to do right  and what ive tried to do in this book and its so great having senator kaine by my side now is to lay out a blueprint for americas future how are we going to get more good jobs infrastructure jobs advanced manufacturing jobs clean renewable energy jobs how are we going to make sure that the economy not only is growing and producing more jobs with rising incomes but is being fair so that people are treated fairly thats why we support we support raising the national minimum wage so that youre not living in poverty when you work full time  my opponent thinks wages are too high i dont know who he talks to but he actually says that and he doesnt believe in raising the national minimum wage i also believe in doing more to support small businesses my dad was a small businessman i believe that we need to do everything we can to help small businesses succeed tim kaine and i were together in cleveland earlier we talked about that tims dad ran a union shop iron workers and hes proud of that that he had a small business father who ran a union shop and employed union workers providing good products i also believe that we have to go finally guarantee equal pay for womens work  and thats because i believe in fairness i dont want to see anybody treated unfairly and discriminated against i dont care who you are if youre willing to work and do your part you should be able to get ahead and stay ahead that is the basic bargain of america so if you look at this book which i hope you will it stands in stark contrast to donald trump he says i alone can fix it now the folks i have met during this campaign and for many years before know that we have challenges know weve got to come together and believe we have to work together to fix what our problems are thats my view i want us to bring people together just the way unions do just the way people in communities do and here in the quad cities and across the country we can see proof every day that we have to come together to meet our challenges so im going to continue to emphasize that we want to be the uniters in this campaign we believe that america is already great and that we can become greater if we do our part  when somebody says i alone can fix it think of the people hes leaving out everybody else leaving out our troops on the front lines leaving out firefighters and police officers who run toward danger leaving our teachers and educators who do they best to change childrens lives leaving out everybody else that is his campaign in a nutshell and what weve got to do in the next  days is to present the vision of america we believe in so were going to continue to say were stronger together were going to work together were going to run a campaign of issues not insults and we are going to be absolutely strong in our support for unions because we know  nobody gets through life alone unions help build the largest middleclass in the history of the world in our country they fought for fair wages safe working conditions theyve helped so many people get on that run to the middleclass and their kids like dick durbin go even higher so i am going to say no to a tax on unions i am going to say no to rolling back collective bargaining i am going to say no to unfair trade deals like the tpp im going to say no  no to pension cuts that deny you the secure retirement that you have worked for and im going to say no to right to work its not right for workers and it is not right for america  but i will say yes to the american dream and heres what i believe the american dream is big enough for all of us if we build it we will expand it and create more opportunities and as we run this campaign on issues our most important  our most important goal is getting the economy to work for everybody theres nothing  nothing more important and how do you do that by creating more jobs and what are some of the areas that i think we can really emphasize infrastructure our roads our bridges our tunnels our ports our airports  also what we cant see our water systems our sewer systems we also need a new electric grid a modern electric grid to be able to take and distribute clean renewable energy i have a goal for us to install a half a billion more solar panels by the end of my first term  it takes a lot of  a lot of jobs a lot of people working to do that and then enough clean energy to power every home by the end of my second term  i also want to finish the work of broadband interconnectivity we have places in our country that still have dialup we have places where kids cant do the homework assignments their teachers give them because they dont have access to the internet that is so unfair think of all the jobs well create when we finish that off and then lets look at advanced manufacturing i believe we can compete with anybody if we put our minds to it and im going to have a manufacturing renaissance policy that will put people to work  i  i am so proud that dennis and lonnie are here because theyve been doing so much to really create the new industries and autos and what the ibew does in so many important areas of our economy i want to be your partner and i think its especially important to recognize that when the chips were down and the auto industry was on its back president obama did the right thing he saved the american auto industry  i supported him then and i support him just as strongly now the american auto industry just had the best year its had in a long time and that was because of the teamwork and the partnership that we had between the companies between the union and because the president of the united states knew we had to save the auto industry donald trump basically said he didnt care didnt matter to him it just shows you how he doesnt understand or care about the real jobs that put bread on the table and give people a sense of purpose and dignity well you wont have to look far to find me in the oval office if im fortunate enough to be your president and to do everything i can every single day to create more jobs to save jobs to bring jobs back from overseas  and if you contrast that with trump his track record  his track record is just the opposite he actually hired a union busting firm for one of his hotels in las vegas he built a career out of not paying workers for the work they did were talking painters plumbers electricians people who thought it was a big deal working for donald trump one of his resorts his casinos he stiffed them he stiffs small businesses like i said my dad was a small businessman he printed drapery fabrics hed get an order hed buy the material hed get the silk screens made i would go sometimes to help him in his print plant hed have these long tables the fabric would be laid out you would take the silk screen youd put it down youd pour the paint in youd take the squeegee youd push it across youd lift the screen up you go all the way down get on the next table all the way back took a lot of time took a lot of hard work when he finished hed load up the fabrics in his car and hed go deliver them i am so happy he never got a contract from donald trump  i dont know what my family wouldve done if my dad did business with people like trump who has told hundreds and hundreds of small business hes been sued  times for not paying the bills that he owes if my dad had been told sorry just kidding were not paying you  this is the man who wants to be president of the united states this is someone who doesnt even honor contracts thats what is so dangerous about this election what donald trump says what he says about the economy that he knows how to create jobs he had six bankruptcies in one bankruptcy alone  people lost their jobs the numbers add up he talks about wanting to protect jobs in america but everything he makes hes made overseas he could have made suits and ties and furniture in the united states but no he made it overseas he even hires workers from overseas and he tells people well he couldnt find americans who wanted to work in the heat you cant make this stuff up can you it is truly unbelievable but whats even worse is what he says about foreign policy as bad as he is about our economy he has insulted our allies he has made common cause with dictators he has basically endorsed vladimir putin and his policies when he says i know more about isis than the generals when he claims our armed forces are a disaster or he insults a gold star family thats not just offensive thats dangerous and just today our intelligence professionals said there was credible evidence for them to pursue an investigation into russias efforts to interfere with our election hacking the democratic national committee and when putin was asked about it didnt deny it in fact he said it was probably a good thing it happened and this is the person that donald trump praises we saw even more evidence last week that he is temperamentally unfit and totally unqualified to be president in just a few hours he managed to turn his trip to mexico into an embarrassing international incident i mean just look at what happened he got into a twitter war with  and why because the president of mexico said i told him in the meeting we werent paying for that wall  so not only did trump mess up his first international engagement he choked he couldnt even bring himself to tell the president of mexico one of his very few policy demands i mean he went back to arizona and gave another hatefilled speech about rounding up and deporting  million people even some of his own advisers are having a hard time explaining that away so hes going to try to distract and divide hes going to hope that we dont pay attention to what hes been saying for   months and we just tune in now these last two months that hes somehow softening his positions that theres a really another donald trump out there well youve got to ask yourself if you cant even go to a friendly foreign country without getting into a fight can this person even claim to have the temperament to be in the oval office and deal with real urgent crises as ive said before and ill say it again a man who can be provoked by a tweet should not be anywhere nuclear weapons  but we have a lot of work to do i think every election is close and tight and tough thats why we have to work as hard as we can between now and when the last votes are counted and thats why i need your help i want to get the economy working for everybody not just those at the top i want to be sure that we lead the world with strength and steadiness and that we protect america here at home and around the world and i want to unify our country i believe with all my heart   that every american must vote must vote i see a woman holding a sign you must vote please it will make a difference and then she says im a gold star daughter  god bless you god bless you i spent my life fighting for kids and families i dont give up i dont quit when we didnt get health care reform i went to work with republicans and democrats we passed the childrens health insurance program that insures  million kids every year  as dick said after we were attacked on  i worked with democrats and republicans to make sure we could rebuild new york and the pentagon and make sure we were as safe as we possibly could be this election will determine so much about our future and one thing i know for sure is we have to start listening to and respecting each other again we may have differences thats the american way but we are stronger together we can do anything if we put our minds to it i saw the picture of mother theresa that was being held up here and i was fortunate to know mother theresa i was fortunate enough to actually work with her we didnt agree on everything but we found common ground she asked me when i was first lady to get a home for babies started in washington so mothers who couldnt care for their babies could take their babies to a safe place and those babies could be adopted  and when mother theresa asked you to do something the only answer was yes maam  and i started working and she would call me shed call me from india shed call me from vietnam she called me from everywhere shed say wheres my home  and id say well mother working with the washington dc zoning department requires divine intervention  and so she did and we got it done  heres what i hope you will do i hope you will get involved in this campaign for these last two months i hope you will go to hillaryclintoncom and see how you can work in illinois in iowa i hope you will text join  join and go to  to see what you can do we need everybody involved there has never been a more important consequential election in our lifetimes  and we need to elect progressive leaders like tammy and cheri and dave loebsack and others who are on the ballot as well i am confident and optimistic about americas future when i listened to donald trump when i watched his convention i honestly did not know what country he was talking about it was so dark so dire so depressing thats not the america i know its not the america that i see i dont deny that we have problems of course we do were human beings but my goodness would you live anywhere else  would you give up our freedom our values our opportunity for anywhere else i traveled to  countries as your secretary of state and everywhere i went i was so proud to land that plane which said the united states of america on it and to come down those stairs and begin to meet on behalf of our values our interests and our security and there is not a place despite what they say that doesnt envy who we are and what we have we cannot put any of that at risk my friends  so for these last two months join this campaign help us make history make sure that we are continuing to be not just great but even greater and that were creating opportunities for the next generation like my grandchildren thats what we can do together if we remember we are stronger together god bless you"
13,"Clinton","i know im only the second most exciting thing thats happened here in the last few days  your big win to open your football season got  got some attention but i am always happy to be at a university that is doing such a superb job in preparing the next generation of students i had the great privilege of speaking to your president dr genshaft thank you  and i will talk in a minute about some of what ive learned about usf and why i think a lot of what you do here is a model for what we need to do in higher education but for me its exciting to be here with so many friends i want to start by thanking  who just introduced me air force reservist former commander of the th aircraft maintenance squadron a woman who has served her country with honor and distinction i would be proud to be her commanderinchief  i want to thank your extraordinary mayor bob buckhorn  bob is an example of the kind of leader who gets things done by bringing people together setting big goals and working to achieve them thats exactly what i want to do as president and i look forward to working with bob and the people of this great city and region that includes a longtime friend of mine state senator arthenia joyner  i have known arthenia long before she was in elected office but shes always been an activist always trying to make things better for people ive known her for  oh i hate to admit it   years  and i am so grateful she is my friend this is the countdown to one of the most important elections in our lifetimes no matter what your age this is going to determine so much about your futures the futures of our children and grandchildren the stakes could not be higher  everyone knows what an important state florida is and its not just because its always a hardfought state its because florida shows all of the excitement the dynamism the opportunities as well as the challenges and problems that we have to face together so we have  days   days to make the case and i cant do it without you and im here  im here to lay out my case one more time and to ask for your help because every single vote counts our campaign set a goal in july we launched a drive to register three million americans to vote this election we have hosted thousands of events across the country including right here in florida and today im asking every one of you to give us some of your precious time to be part of this campaign and im going to run through some of the reasons why every single person here has a real stake in making sure our country heads into the future with confidence and optimism that we truly are stronger together because thats what will determine whether we have the economy that produces more good jobs with rising incomes whether we have an education system that prepares our young people for the jobs of the future whether college is affordable whether student debt can be paid back whether our health care system works whether we lead the world with strength and steadiness working with allies and partners to make sure that we move toward peace and prosperity there is an exciting bold agenda before us but it cannot be done by any one person it must be done by all of us and that is something that donald trump does not understand  among the many troubling things that were said at his convention  and honestly i sometimes didnt recognize what country they were talking about it was so dire so dark so divisive so dangerous but among the things he said was i alone can fix it  think of who that leaves out our men and women in uniform troops on the front line people like mary who put on the uniform of the air force to serve our country think about the police and firefighters who rushed toward danger think about those brave police officers and emergency responders in orlando when the pulse nightclub was attacked  think about all the teachers the educators the professors the staff who work to give young people a much better chance in the race of life think about all the hard working people who cant build a house by themselves cant erect one of donald trumps skyscrapers by themselves think of all the small businesses that take a big chance my dad was a small business man i know what a chance it is he couldnt do it alone he needed customers he needed suppliers he needed workers americans dont say i alone can fix it we say well fix it together just watch us nobody  nobody can solve problems better than we can  and i want to be a president for all americans not some americans democrats republicans independents every single american  i want to be a president for those who vote for me and those who vote against me because i want to bring our country together  im very proud that tim kaine and i are running a campaign of issues not insults  because i believe anybody who is asking for your vote for the most important job not just in the country but in the world should tell you what they plan to do i do have this  i guess its an old fashioned idea if youre going to ask people for their vote they ought to have some idea what theyre voting for and i dont think its enough to say oh ill tell you later  i think its important to lay it out and to tell you how its going to be paid for and thats why starting today and especially for young people but really for everybody we are putting out a book its called stronger together and in it  it shows this is more than a slogan for the campaign this is a blueprint for americas future  among the things that we talk about is the core of our agenda as laid out in this book it is building an economy that works for everyone not just those at the top  were going to make the biggest investment in new jobs since world war ii  infrastructure jobs like those here at the port our roads our bridges our tunnels our ports our airports they need work and there are millions of jobs to be done  and in addition to what you can see what about our water systems our sewer systems we need a new modern electric grid to be able to take in clean renewable energy that can then move us toward that future we see  i have a plan to install a half a billion solar panels by the end of my first term  and enough clean energy to power every home in america by the end of my second term  and i want young people especially to be part of this to be in science technology engineering manufacturing creating this future that will determine the quality of your lives and the competitiveness of our economy we also have to finish extending broadband access to every place in america  right now  percent of our teachers say that they assign homework to their students starting in elementary school they require the kids to learn how to use the internet i think thats great we want to have an internetsavvy population but heres the problem five million homes where little kids live where high school kids live dont have the internet what does that mean that means theyre already behind its so unfair were going to make this economy grow but were also going to make it fair were going to have more advanced manufacturing jobs  i think we made a mistake years ago when we eliminated what used to be called vocational education  weve got to return technical education to our high schools our community colleges there are right now more than a million jobs that can be filled by people who are machinists computer designers tool and die makers but for whatever reason they havent been given the chance to get that training and maybe theyve been told you know what the only future is to go to a great university like usf well that is true for a lot of people but its not true for everybody and we need to make the hard work that builds america the kind of great work with respect and purpose that is going to attract a new generation  thats why youll read what i want to do in here were going to try to make community college free were also going to have apprenticeship programs   im going to give a tax credit to any company that is willing to pay a young person while that young  parents made its time for us to step up and build americas future and lets make it fair while we do that thats why ive said were going to emphasis the importance of small businesses right now small businesses are having a tough time in florida and across america getting access to credit right and getting the kinds of regulations and overlapping expectations and standards that dont really make sense i want to make it clean and clear and i particularly want young people with an idea for a small business to feel that they can do it so i have proposed a moratorium for three years on student debt so you can actually get a business off the ground get it started make your future  i also believe we should raise the national minimum wage anybody working full time should not be living in poverty  and finally lets guarantee equal pay for womens work which will raise family income  anyone whos willing to work hard should have enough money to raise a family did anybody of you watch any of the democratic convention  well i dont know if you saw these two young people years old from kansas young man young woman went to the same high school about to be seniors get a summer job working in a pizza restaurant in their home town theyre pretty excited i remember when i had what i thought of as my first real job not baby sitting not you know just kind of knocking around but a real job where i had to actually show up someplace and get a paycheck that was pretty exciting so a young man young woman were at our convention heres the story they told they were talking together one day after work theyd known each other and the young woman said you know im excited because i think im actually going to be able to save some money for college making  an hour and her friend the young man looked at her and he goes im making  an hour and the young woman said well you didnt have any experience before this job doing this did you he said no you know i didnt he  said well what do you think happened the young man said oh it must be a mistake so they together and i give the young man a lot of credit  good guy right  they go to tell the manager that theres been a mistake theyre doing exactly the same job hes making  more an hour what happens the manager fired them both  and you know what thats legal if you find out about somebody elses salary even if youre doing exactly the same job you can be retaliated against including being fired in most places so when i say lets have equal pay and some people i see looking quizzical at me they say well of course youve got to have equal pay well yeah if youre in the military and the pay scale is set or youre in the government and its set or youre under a union contract and its set but if youre in the vast majority of jobs in america you have no idea whether youre being paid fairly so we can not let that continue thats wrong in america if youre doing the job you deserve to get the pay  and so how are we going to fund this well ill tell you were going where the money is were going to the people whove made the money in the last  years were going to the top onetenth percent the millionaires the billionaires theyre going to have to start paying for supporting our military supporting our education system supporting our health care system  there could not be a bigger contrast between what ive proposed when it comes to taxes and what donald trump has proposed he actually has proposed giving trillions  and i mean that with a t  trillions in tax cuts to big corporations millionaires billionaires and wall street money managers  that would not only explode our national debt it would lead to massive cuts in education and health care and many of his proposals would really benefit his own family but do nothing for the remaining plus percent of americans and in fact independent analysts have said this theyve looked at our plans  he doesnt have much in the way of plans but theyve looked at what he has said  and theyve concluded if we did what trump is recommending we would lose  million jobs in four years if we do what im recommending we stand to gain over  million jobs in the next four years  and among the things that i want to do is make sure we have an education system from early childhood through adulthood and that means i want universal prek i want to help more kids get a better start so that when they get to kindergarten and first grade theyre ready to learn i want to work with our teachers and educators i respect teachers and educators and i want to give them the support they need to do the job we ask  and i want to support universities like this one now heres one of the reasons why fifty thousand students  percent on pell grants a lot of people would never have gotten an education if it werent for the federal pell grant program right  but heres whats most impressive a lot of schools have a lot of pell grants this university graduates all categories of students at the same rate if youre a pell grant student a nonpell grant student if youre white africanamerican latina a latino asian everybody graduates at the same rate  and why that happens is because this university makes a particular commitment to every student and moves as quickly as possible to help kids who maybe are first generation college students right  i  you know ive got to tell you when i got to college  now my father went to college on a football scholarship i knew i wasnt going to college on a football scholarship  my mother had a really difficult childhood she never got to go to college so my dad couldnt really tell me much about going to college because he basically paid  played football for four years and loved it my mom couldnt tell me so when i got to college i felt so out of place i was so nervous there used to be something way back in the dark ages called collect phone calls  where you would call collect which meant that your parents had to pay for it and you just waited to see whether theyd accept it so i called home and i said i cant  i cant do this its too hard everybody here is smarter than i am theyre better prepared than i am i want to come home and my father who didnt want me to go so far away to school anyway he said come home  and my mother said no you have to stick it out and if you feel the same way at the end of the year then you can make a different decision of course my mother was right i loved it within a month or two but i know what it feels like to show up and wonder can you make it are you good enough are you smart enough and thank goodness usf has people waiting to mentor and reassure and guide students every single college and university needs to have that and then weve got to make it affordable so kids dont have to leave because they no longer have the funding that they need  and i want to do more in my effort to make childcare affordable no family should have to pay more than  percent of your income on childcare and right now you have a lot of states where it costs more for childcare than tuition at college and university so im going to do  i know youve got childcare here but as i told the president i want to do more to help you to make sure every student parent has a safe place to bring their child while theyre studying and working and trying to get their education and then were going to help everybody with student debt how many of you have student debt  were going to help you pay it back and pay it off quickly were going to get the interest rates down were going to give you new ways of paying it  because right now we have too may people laboring under student debt in a way that holds your own futures back so were going to lift that burden off of you and were also going to make sure you can get quality affordable health care every age you are every place you are were going to get the costs down premiums copays deductibles and especially prescription drug costs  and there are two other things were going to take on because ive heard about this all across america were going to take on helping more people with mental health and addiction problems get the help you need  so im excited about what we can do to create an economy and education and health care system that works and while we do it were going to be protecting the rights of americans all americans we have fought too hard we have come too far and that means civil rights and it means womens rights and gay rights and voter rights and workers rights and disability rights  and you know i believe with all my heart because ive done this work my entire life i was looking at the disability sign there my first job out of law school was with the childrens defense fund i did a lot of interesting things and one of them was to gather evidence about why so many kids with disabilities were out of school there was no requirement that you went to school if you were blind deaf in a wheelchair and we changed the law the first nation in the world to do that and i am so proud of our country  so these rights are not for somebody else we all know somebody we all know a woman we all know somebody in a racial or ethnic minority we all know a worker or a voter we all know a gay person and we all know somebody with a disability these are our rights and the kinds of things that youve been hearing from donald trump demeaning defaming groups of americans people who have every right to be respected by someone who wants to be president of the united states and he stands there and mocks a reporter with a disability and he calls women pigs and he calls mexican immigrants rapists and criminals  and he demeans muslims and attacks a gold star family whose son died in action in iraq thats not who we are so yes we have a lot of plans but we also have values my friends and were going to stand up for american values  our book also outlines how were going to keep our country safe from all threats were going to work with our allies not insult them were going to stand up to our adversaries not cozy up to them were going to have real plans not claims and secret plans this november the american people have a big choice to make when it comes to national security on the one hand we have donald trump who has called the american military a disaster  who disrespects our military leaders by saying and i quote i know more about isis than the generals do his companies  and listen to this because i know there are a lot of veterans and a lot of you know active duty people based here in tampa his companies  trump companies have fired veterans because they had to take time off to fulfill their military commitments  and we all saw him disparage the khans a gold star family who lost their son in a car bomb explosion in iraq as he ran toward it to prevent the loss of life of people in his unit and saving hundreds of his fellow soldiers and when asked why he would insult a gold star family he suggested that his sacrifices are somehow comparable to theirs because he said and again i quote   were going to bolster our defenses including with an intelligence surge to protect us and our allies we will do whatever is necessary for as long as it takes to bring isis to justice and end their reign of terror once and for all  and i will tell you this i am a very patient person i dont quit i dont give up i dont blink this sunday will be the th anniversary of the attack of  i was a senator from new york i knew people who were killed i worked with families and the few survivors i worked to get the health care needed by our first responders and emergency workers who ran toward danger  i worked to make our country safer and to rebuild new york and the pentagon but i always always was determined to do anything i could to bring bin laden to justice  and thanks to the very patient painstaking work of the american intelligence community finally when i was secretary of state we were given the opportunity to evaluate the best evidence we had seen in a long time and i was honored to be part of that small group in the situation room advising president obama as we went through the evidence over and over and over again trying to decide was it credible enough strong enough to take action and if we did what kind of action would it be a missile strike would it be a bombing would it be an attack by special forces and when it came time to go around the table these were all extremely experienced thoughtful experts we all gave our opinions i was one who said i thought it was worth the risk and i was  and i was in that small situation room on that day you all know the story some of you read the book some of you have seen the movies but theres one thing i want to tell you because it demonstrates again what our values are as americans remember donald trump has said he would order american troops to torture he would order american troops to murder family members of terrorists thats what he has said heedless of the consequences that that would lead to in terms of putting americans all over the world at even greater risk heres what happened that night in pakistan this is not an often told part of the story so i want to tell you particularly the young people here particularly active duty and military veterans like mary if you saw any of the reenactment you know that one of the helicopters clipped its tail as it was going into the courtyard on the wall  it disabled that helicopter now thankfully every contingency had been thought through and so we were prepared for that the military was prepared they could get another helicopter there to take out the seals who were going to have to blow up the disabled helicopter after rushing into the compound taking out the two body guards taking out bin ladens adult son taking out bin laden they knew they had to get out of there at any time there could have been pakistani military wondering whats going on somethings happening this was a military garrisoned town so time was really precious and heres what the seals did before they blew that helicopter up they took out all the women and children family members of terrorists including the worst terrorist of all they took them out of the compound around the back to safety before they blew that helicopter up that donald trump is what american honor looks like  i want to mention just three other threats one threat here right at home  the epidemic of gun violence and we have got to have comprehensive background checks close the gun show loophole close the online loophole and the ability of people on the terrorist watch list buying a gun in america this agenda ive just briefly outlined is supported by a vast majority of americans and a vast majority of american gun owners and its time we all said in one voice hey we can respect the second amendment we can respect the right to own arms but we dont want people who shouldnt have guns in the first place killing anybody else ever again  another threat to our country is climate change  was the hottest year on record and the science is clear its real its reeking havoc on communities across america last weeks hurricane was another reminder of the devastation that extreme weather can cause and i send my thoughts and prayers to everyone affected by hermine but this is not the last one thats going to hit florida given whats happening in the climate nobody knows that better than folks right here in tampa and in the broader region sea levels have been rising here about an inch per decade since the s at the rate we are going by  which is not that far away  billion of coastal property in this state will be flooding at high tide and whenever our infrastructure is threatened so too is our homeland security the next president will have to work with communities like tampas to prepare for future storms  when im in the oval office im going to work with local leaders to make smart investments in infrastructure to help protect regions from flooding and other effects of climate change im going to continue to work on the international and national level to try to turn the clock back to stabilize and reduce emissions even more to try to gain more time but were going to have to begin working immediately on mitigation and resilience and prevention as well  and what about donald trump well he doesnt even believe in climate change he says its a hoax invented by the chinese and he says quote you cant get hurt with extreme weather now this is the same guy who at one of his golf courses in some coastal place has demanded that a seawall be built to protect his golf course from rising tides so its all fine if it affects donald but if affects the rest of humanity he could care less if it affects people who lose their homes or their businesses that took a lifetime to build doesnt matter to him when it comes to protecting our country against natural disasters and the threat of climate change once again donald trump is totally unfit and unqualified to be our president  and lets not forget the next president also has to keep our country safe from public health crises like zika its painfully obvious we cant rely on the republican congress or republican governors to fund an adequate response  they cant help themselves from playing games even when lives are on the line i call on all republicans to put people before politics and finally vote in favor of a clean funding bill to fight zika right here in florida  but the failure of the republicans in congress including your republican senator means that we cant always count on them can we so last month i announced that as president i will create a public health rapid response fund to be available when emergencies occur to have a consistent budget to better enable government agencies at all levels to quickly respond to major public health crises and pandemics  this will complement our efforts to prepare our country to deal with those challenges and because of climate change were going to have more of them because of mobility around the world you can get on a plane in africa and bring ebola to the united states you could be a mosquito in brazil and make your way to florida weve got to be better prepared its always better to invest a penny in the frontend than to have to pay many dollars after the crisis has already occurred  thats why it is time that when we talk about protecting public health to put politics aside and put our peoples needs first now im excited about doing all of this with you for you on your behalf but i cant do it without you and heres what im asking the deadline to register voters is october th if any of you are not registered or

registration shift and you can also apply if youre really interested to our get out the vote fellowship program were going to organize special groups to get people to the polls and we need you this state has so much promise and i want to be the best president that you could possibly have in florida i want to work on all of these issues everything thats in this blueprint that we have published and i want particularly to give the young people of this university this state this country the best shot you can have to be part of the american dream however you define that many of us  many of us who came before know that there were barriers in the way when i was a young woman there were schools i couldnt go to jobs i couldnt get scholarships i wasnt eligible for just because i was a woman and a lot of those barriers have been knocked down for every african american latino asian american native american gay american you know that barriers have been knocked down but theyre not all down and weve got to make sure theyre all gone and that no demagogue can ever bring them back and can ever exploit the fears and insecurities of the american people  so please vote this year like your future depends on it because it does and if you give me the great honor of serving as your president i will get up every single day in that white house and i will work my heart out for those better jobs better educational opportunities better health care with quality and affordability protecting our rights protecting our country unifying america  because we need to be the united states not the divided states of america  and yes remember as that sign over there says i believe this too love trumps hate lets have a future that proves thats true thank you all god bless you"
14,"Clinton","good morning good morning good morning everyone last night i was very glad to be able to begin a conversation with the american people and offer some of my thoughts about isis iran and how we reform the va system to provide better care for our vets and im honored that in the last  hours more retired generals and admirals have decided to endorse my campaign to focus more on these crucial challenges tomorrow im convening a meeting of bipartisan national security leaders and experts including former secretaries of homeland security michael chertoff and janet napolitano general john allen former acting director of the cia michael morell and former nato supreme allied commander james stavridis and others we will discuss how to intensify our efforts to defeat isis and keep our country safe to that end i want to underscore something that i mentioned last night we should make it a top priority to hunt down the leader of isis abu bakr albaghdadi and bring him to justice just as we did with osama bin laden as with that operation getting albaghdadi will require a focused effort driven at the highest levels but i believe it will send a resounding message that nobody directs or inspires attacks against the united states and gets away with it let me be clear last night was yet another test and donald trump failed yet again we saw more evidence that he is temperamentally unfit and totally unqualified to be commander in chief he trashtalks american generals saying theyve been quote reduced to rubble he suggested he would fire them and replace them with his handpicked generals he attacked dozens of former flag officers by saying that quote weve  been losing for us for a long time thats how he talks about distinguished men and women who have spent their lives serving our country sacrificing for us thats how he would act as commander in chief meanwhile bizarrely once again he praised russias strongman vladimir putin even taking the astonishing step of suggesting that he prefers the russian president to our american president now that is not just unpatriotic and insulting to the people of our country as well as to our commander in chief it is scary because it suggests he will let putin do whatever putin wants to do and then make excuses for him  i was just thinking about all of the presidents that would just be looking at one another in total astonishment what would ronald reagan say about a republican nominee who attacks americas generals and heaps praise on russias president i think we know the answer and when asked how he would stop the spread of global terrorism trumps answer was simply take the oil the united states of america does not invade other countries to plunder and pillage we dont send our brave men and women around the world to steal oil and thats not even getting into the absurdity of what it would involve massive infrastructure large numbers of troops many years on the ground of course trump hasnt thought through any of that every republican holding or seeking office in this country should be asked if they agree with donald trump about these statements now one thing you didnt hear from trump last night is any plan to take on isis one of the biggest threats facing our country he says his plan is still a secret but the truth is he simply doesnt have one and thats not only dangerous it should be disqualifying so i have a very different vision for how we keep our country safe and strong i respect the men and women who put their lives on the line to serve america i will work with our allies to defeat isis and i will hold true to our countrys most cherished values you know even with all of the attention paid to the campaign we cannot forget how important this decision is this weekend is the th anniversary of  i will never forget the horror of that day but i will never forget either the victims and survivors and the brave first responders and emergency responders that i met with and served and worked for as senator from new york thats what kept me working so hard in the senate on behalf of  families thats who i was thinking of  years later in the white house situation room with president obama when the decision was made to bring osama bin laden to justice thats the kind of commander in chief i will be someone who will bring us together in common purpose to keep our people safe and our country strong   well as ive said many many times ive always thought this was going to be a close election thats why weve been putting organizations in place gearing up for these final weeks to mobilize and turn out our voters thats exactly what were going to do and i feel were in a strong position but were not taking anyplace anyone anything for granted were going to keep working as hard as we can and hopefully pull out as many voters who agree with me as we possibly can muster   hi jeff    well jeff  first of all ive said that before ive said it on numerous occasions i believe it i think putting a big contingent of american ground troops on the ground in iraq and syria would not be in the best interest of the fight against isis and other terrorist groups in fact i think it would fulfill one of their dearest wishes which is to drag the united states back into a ground war in that region however ive been very clear and i said this again last night i support the air campaign i support special forces i support enablers i support surveillance intelligence and reconnaissance i will absolutely be prepared to do whatever is necessary to support the arab and kurdish fighters on the ground to take out as much of the infrastructure of isis from the air to go after baghdadi as i said today with a very focused commitment to taking him off the battlefield  i think the approach ive outlined intensifies what we are doing but also recognizes that there is no in my opinion path forward to ground troops that would be in our interests   well im going to let all of you ponder that last question i think there will be a lot of phd theses and popular journalism writing on that subject for years to come i dont take my advice and i dont take anything seriously that comes from the rnc we were talking about serious issues last night i know the difference between what we have to do to fix the va what we have to do to take the fight to isis than just making political happy talk and i had a very short window of time in that event last night to convey the seriousness with which i would approach the issues that concern our country donald trump chose to talk about his deep admiration and support for vladimir putin maybe he did it with a smile and i guess the rnc wouldve liked that   like the hat   is this a new look   oh youre bringing it back   went shopping in your closet   yeah i do a lot of that   i think what he said was totally inappropriate and undisciplined i would never comment on any aspect of an intelligence briefing that i received   thats a very fair question i  i have been somewhat heartened by the number of articles recently pointing out the quite disparate treatment of trump and his campaign compared to ours i dont understand the reasons for it i find it frustrating but its just part of the landscape that we live in and we just keep forging ahead look i  i think this is a really important moment for everybody in our country as you have seen by the numbers of republicans concerned about trump coming forward and saying this is not acceptable they are willing to put their names out there people whove never endorsed a democrat people whove never endorsed before because they are so concerned about this man and how totally unqualified he is to be president and how totally temperamentally unfit he is to be commander in chief so i know that he says outrageous things on a you know pretty regular basis and i know thats part of the coverage and i know that it may be difficult to feel that you know exactly how to respond to some of his behavior but were on the brink of making a very critical decision for our country and if i were not the candidate if i were not the nominee if i were just a concerned citizen id be out here doing everything i could to sound the alarm about someone like donald trump getting anywhere near the white house and i will continue to do that   well you could look on the map and find aleppo   i love you andrea you are indefatigable youre my kind of woman ill tell you what look at this ok i know go ahead i mean the sympathy vote the whole thing i love it   yes   matt olsen right right   right right   no thats not true   well you know look i mean the republicans are just in a terrible dilemma trying to support a totally unqualified nominee i have no sympathy for them its their nominee but i am not going to tolerate them continuing to make misleading inaccurate accusations and putting out misinformation about me and heres the latest example matt olsen the very distinguished and effective former director of the national counterterrorism center was so disturbed by what he has seen coming from the trump campaign that he wrote an article that i guess came online in the last  hours pulling from public sources very clear statements by isis leaders essentially throwing whatever support they have to donald trump they have as matt olsen pointed out said they hoped that allah delivers america to trump they have said that they hope that he is the president because it would give even more motivation to every jihadi someone who has insulted muslims has insulted a gold star family of an incredibly heroic captain khan someone who has said he doesnt want to let muslims around the world even come to our country that is a gift for isis and that is what matt olsen who knows more about this than the republicans trying to somehow muddy the waters very clearly stated thats what i mean and look im not asking for any special treatment i  i know the road that im on ive been on it for  years and i just get up every day and keep moving forward i love this country i will serve it with my entire heart mind and soul i will do everything i can to protect america and i will do everything i can to make sure donald trump is not president for many reasons but this latest information coming from a distinguished counterterrorism expert should put every americans mind in motion to try to figure out what everyone can do to prevent trump from being the president   thank you"
15,"Clinton","good evening this is the day the lord has made let us rejoice and be glad in it  president young pastors friends im very grateful for this great chance to be with you during your week of convention im especially pleased to see my friend the mayor of this great city he is someone who  if you havent gotten to know i hope you do  thank you mayor sly james i was also   delighted to greet on the way in the new jackson county executive major league baseball star and all around good guy frank white who has done such an incredible amount of good work on the field and now off the field i want to thank all of you dr miles dr brown all our friends from this city and this state for hosting us i want to acknowledge on a personal point dr shaw celebrating  years as pastor of the white rock baptist church  when i saw him tonight i kidded him and said he started when he was two  im sure theres a law against that dr shaw dr mckinney dr brown all the members of the executive board and state presidents now i know that reverend jackson was with you on monday and congressman cleaver was with you on tuesday so talk about two tough acts to follow but they are both dear longstanding friends of mine and im honored to be on this same stage as so many distinguished leaders now i happen to be a born and raised methodist but ive been married to a southern baptist for more than  years  and from arkansas to new york  friends of arkansas john weve got friends from arkansas here but across this great country youve welcomed me into your congregations with open arms and open hearts and i am grateful for the friendship support and christian hospitality i have found there as pastors as spouses of pastors families of pastors you know better than anyone the importance of building relationships of trust and respect and i am sure some of you are sick and tired of politicians who think they can just show up at election time say a few nice words and then earn your support right well you and your congregations deserve better than that you deserve a sustained commitment to expanding opportunity equity and justice not just for two or four years not just when the cameras are on and people are watching but every single day and you know better than anyone that people who look at the africanamerican community and see only poverty crime and despair are missing so much  theyre missing the vibrancy of black owned businesses the excellence of historically black colleges and universities  theyre missing the success of black leaders in every field and the passion of a new generation of young black activists and yes they are missing the strength of the black church the solid rock on which so much is built  well i see you i see the work you do and the lives you change and today i want to say something that you dont hear often enough thank you thank you  thank you for answering the charge given to us by jesus as matthew records defeed the hungry clothe the naked visit the sick welcome the stranger thank you for loving all people especially the least the last and the lost among us and you know so well were not asked to love each other not urged or requested we are commanded to love  in deed jesus made it his greatest commandment when i used to teach the occasional sunday school class i often taught on that lesson thats a hard commandment to obey some days its really hard for me  but in so many ways all of you have answered that call ive been privileged to see your love in action with my own eyes ive seen the love at mount zion missionary baptist church in cedar rapids iowa pastor damien epps and his congregation collected tens of thousands of water bottles to send to families in flint michigan suffering from water poisoned with lead  because they remembered that eight years before when the mississippi rose up and flooded eastern iowa others came to there aid as pastor epps said they are fellow americans they are human beings we should want to reach out and help and hes right that ethic is at the core of our christian faith and we all have work together to make sure every child in america has clean water to drink clean air to breathe and good schools no matter what zip code they live in ive seen the love at tabernacle community baptist church in milwaukee reverend don darius butler has helped organize gun buy back programs because none of us can sit back while the epidemic of gun violence ravages our communities and our country it is as you know by the far the leading cause of death for young black men more than the next nine causes of death combined and i promise you this as president ill stand with you in the fight for commonsense gun safety reforms  ive seen the love at the triumph baptist church in philadelphia where reverend james hall guided by what he calls the three es of evangelism education and economic development has been led to set up a credit union to help people in the community overlooked or ignored by the banks so they can get a small business loan save for college or put something away for retirement theyve helped build a supermarket in a neighborhood that hadnt seen one in more than  years and theyre reaching out beyond the pews to help families live healthy prosperous lives ive seen the love at dexter avenue king memorial baptist church in montgomery alabama it was an honor to join reverend cromwell handy and his congregation last december to celebrate the th anniversary of rosa parks courageous action against segregation  and by the way   rosa parks may have opened up every seat on the bus now its our job to create good jobs so everyone can afford the fare and they can actually get bus routes to reach every neighborhood that connects them with safe affordable housing and good jobs as president i will be your partner in this work of translating love into action together well make transformative investments in communities that have been left out and left behind for far too long from our neglected inner cities to struggling rural communities well work with both parties to make the biggest investment in good new jobs since world war ii including  billion to tackle the challenge of youth unemployment which is twice as high for young africanamericans as it is for young white americans  well ban the box and do more to help people whove paid their debt to society find jobs and housing when they get out  and we will embrace congressman jim clyburns    plan steering  percent of federal investments to neighborhoods where  percent of the population has been living below the poverty line for  years  thats a great idea whose time has come and we can translate it into reality together well face head on systemic racism and work to reform our criminal justice system from end to end because everyone in every community should have respect for the law and be respected by the law  well beat back the assault on voting rights it is a blast from the jim crow past that must be stopped  we should be expanding voting rights instead the best way to stand up to those who are trying to prevent any person from exercising his or her vote is to register and show up and vote against them and make sure your vote counts loudly and clearly  theres so much we can do if we keep love in our hearts as we do the nobel work of breaking down barriers that hold americans back now as you well know we are in the final stretch of the election that may be the most consequential of our lifetimes an election in which all of these issues and so many more are at stake our nations values are being questioned in this election we are facing a candidate with a long history of racial discrimination in his business  who traffics in toxic conspiracy theories like the lie that president obama is not a true american  if he doesnt even respect all americans how can he serve all americans  so we must keep calling him out and rejecting the hateful bigoted rhetoric that seeks to pit americans one against each other and continue making the case in every way for our vision of an america that is stronger together an america where all our children have the choice to live up to their god given potential no matter where they come from or what they look like or what the circumstances of their lives have been i have laid out my vision and my agenda in fact senator kaine and i have just published a book called stronger together that lays it out clearly so you know what youre voting for not just against  and were going to get the economy to work for everyone not just those at the top how were going to have more jobs and infrastructure advanced manufacturing clean renewable energy how were going to do more to help small businesses the fastest growing segment of small business in america today our small businesses started by africanamerican women  i want to be a small business president to help everyone willing to take the chance and were going to make the economy fairer we are going to raise the national minimum wage noone who works full time should be mired in poverty at the end of a long hard year  and yes we are finally going to guarantee equal pay for womens work so that we raise family incomes and provide the respect that comes from being paid what you are entitled to earn and were going to make education work for every child early childhood education universal prekindergarten i want to bring technical education back into high school it was a mistake when we took all that vocational education out of our high schools  i want every young person who wants to go to college to be able to go to college but i want every young person who wants to do a good days work in a job that builds america the machinist the tool and dye makers the computer coders i want them to feel they are just as welcome and wanted and were going to make college affordable for everybody and i have a  billion plan specifically focused on historically black colleges and universities that serve our nation and provide the leaders of the next generation  and were going to help you pay down your student debt  it is way past time and lets make sure health care is available affordable of high quality for everybody and weve got to get the cost of prescription drugs down  and we have to do more to help with mental health and addiction two problems i hear about across our country which i know you hear about in your churches so we have a lot of work to do and were going to keep working to earn every vote and never take any community or any person for granted tim kaine and i have launched a nationwide drive to register and commit  million americans to vote by election day and i hope you will be part of it  this election is too important for anyone to sit on the sidelines today for a few minutes i want to leave aside the politics and do something that doesnt always come naturally to a mid western methodist  that is to talk about my own faith how it lead me to a life of service how it will guide me as president sometimes people ask me are you a praying person and i tell them if i wasnt one before   one week living in the white house or on the campaign trail would have turned me into a praying person but i had the great blessing to be raised by a family in a church that instilled in me a deep and abiding christian faith and practice i still remember my late father a gruff former navy man on his knees praying by his bed every night that made a big impression on me as a young girl seeing him humble himself before god my mother taught sunday school at our church partly she said because she wanted to make sure my brothers actually showed up at sunday school when they walked out the door her faith was rooted in gratitude for the love that helped her survive a painful childhood after her own family abandoned and mistreated her she was sustained by the kindness of others like the first grade teacher who saw she had nothing to eat at lunch and brought extra food to share my mother was determined to pay that kindness forward and she really liked the wesley and credo of our church  do all the good you can for all the people you can in all the ways you can as long as ever you can i was also so blessed to have a remarkable youth minister who believed like john wesley the founder of methodism that the world is my parish he told us these young white kids in a suburban area of chicago you cant just be satisfied in your own church and your own middle class life were going into the inner city of chicago were going into church basements for fellowship with young people your age from africanamerican churches and hispanic churches that was the first time i was in a black church when i was a teenager he took us to hear dr martin luther king jr speak  he sent home the permission slips  whether we could get in the church van to go into chicago on a sunday night to hear dr king and some of the parents wouldnt let their kids go my mother said this is a historic opportunity i remember  i remember hearing dr king preach one of those wellknown sermons staying awake during the revolution and then i stood in line with everybody in that big hall just to shake his hand and look into his eye his words the power of his example affected me deeply and added to the lessons of my minister to face the world as it is not as we might want it to be but to commit ourselves to turning it into what it should be so thanks to my family and my church i am braced in activist social justice faith the roll up your sleeves and get your hands dirty faith as st francis of assisi reportedly advised try to preach the gospel always and if necessary use words  the scripture tells us that faith without words is dead the epistle of james tells us we cannot just be hearers of the word we must be doers and i believe that with all my heart i am grateful for the gift of personal salvation and for the great obligation of the social gospel  to use the gift of grace wisely to reflect the love of god and follow the example of jesus christ to the greater good of gods beloved community thats what lead me to devote my life in the ways i could to serving others especially children i went to work right out of law school for the great marian wright edelman the daughter of a baptist minister from bennettsville south carolina and the founder of the childrens defense fund  she sent me door to door in new bedford massachusetts on behalf of children with disabilities who werent able at that time to attend public schools to south carolina to investigate the plight of  and  year old boys imprisoned alongside grown men who had committed serious felonies and to alabama to expose the racism of segregated academies  i went undercover to alabama all by myself mary just said well you just have to go do it and i did now it would have been easier and certainly more remunerative to follow many of my law school classmates to a high powered new york law firm but the call to service rooted in my faith was just too powerful for me it has always been about trying to live up to the responsibility described by the prophet micah that we do justice love kindness and walk humbly with our god  humility is not something you hear much about in politics is it   but we should none of us is perfect st paul reminds us we all see through a glass darkly and for now only know in part its because of that because of the limitations we all face that faith requires a leap the conviction of things unseen its because of our limitations and imperfections that we must reach out beyond ourselves to god and to each other it isnt easy but ive learned to be grateful not just for my blessings but also for my faults and there are plenty ive made my share of mistakes i dont know anyone who hasnt everyone here today has stumbled on their own stony paths its grace that lifts us up and grace that leads us home  but its also our job to learn from our mistakes to do all we can to do better next time and to stay grateful to live by the discipline of gratitude our christian faith is a journey that never ends its a constant challenge to live up to our own hopes and ideals to love and to forgive others as we want to be loved and forgiven ourselves you know as president obama reminded us seeking high office is by definition an act of audacity and yet our greatest leaders are often the most humble because they recognize both the awesome responsibilities of power and the frailties of human action ive sat in the situation room with president obama weighing conflicting advice and imperfect information wrestling with the hardest choices a leader can make whether to send our young men and women into harms way knowing that some of them will never return there is nothing more humbling than that nothing that should drive you to your knees more than that thats why in this time of both peril and promise we need a president who understands that none of us has all the answers and no one person can fix our problems alone  a president who understands we have to look out for each other and lift each other up not tear each other down thats what we need to do together invest in our people believe in each other create the jobs and the schools and the opportunities for young people so that they believe that we care about them send our children to schools that reflect their promise not our neglect make sure every child is given the health care he or she needs whether it is for an ailment of the body or the mind stand ready to lift each other up when we fall as we will give those who have made mistakes a second third chance our faith is a faith of second and third and fourth and fifth chances for those who genuinely are seeking redemption  and we need a president who understands the powerful role that faith and communities of faith have always played in moving our country toward justice from the abolitionists of the th century to the civil rights movement of the th century to the unfinished business of today a president who will pray with you and for you  who will defend the dignity of every individual and the principal of religious freedom that was woven into the moral fabric of our nation from the very beginning yes we need a president who will do justice love kindness and walk humbly with our god my friends one of the greatest privileges of this campaign has been getting to know a remarkable group of women whove lost children to gun violence or police incidents theyre known as the mothers of the movement and their hearts may be broken but their souls shine through ill never forget listening to gwen carr the mother of eric garner describe the mission these mothers feel called to lead we were at the central baptist church in columbia south carolina pastored by reverend ricky ray ezell senior i wish you all could have heard her gwen was as eloquent as any preacher she recalled the pain of losing her son she said at first she couldnt even get out of bed but then she said the lord talked to me and told me are you going to lay here and die like your son or are you going to get up and uplift his name she realized in that moment that none of us can rest as long as there are others out there to be saved and that her voice could move people to action and then she said this i had to turn my sorrow into a strategy my morning into a movement gwen hasnt stopped working since bringing more and more allies to the cause of peace and justice because she knows in a way that tragedy and profound loss can teach us that we are stronger together than we could ever be alone gwen and the other mothers of the movement are living what the scripture tells us let us not grow weary in doing good for in due season we shall reap if we do not lose heart  these are words we all should live by and if i have the great honor of serving as your president these are words that i will lead by thank you all and may god bless you and may god bless our great country thank you"
16,"Clinton","whoa it is so great to be here thank you all so much and i was backstage listening to jordan popes story and it was just so powerful and moving and her ability to stand up here talk about her personal family experienced coming out of katrina staying strong moving forward being a student here at johnson c smith university i am so excited  i want to thank her and i want to thank dr carter thank you for welcoming us here you have welcomed two clintons in the last year there is something about this place that has attracted both my husband and myself i apologize for being late we had a disabled airplane on the runway that had to get moved it took a lot longer than expected but ive been looking forward to joining all of you here in charlotte i want to recognized and thank your mayor mayor jennifer roberts there you are thank you mayor roberts i want to thank trevor fuller chair of the mecklenburg county commission i want to acknowledge josh stein candidate for attorney general and to all of you gathered here today it is  days until the election  and i think its so appropriate to be here in the great state of north carolina at a really well renowned h you know what im saying hbcu historically black college and university   that like so many others has played such an important role in our countrys history producing some of americas finest leaders and i am very proud i was just doing a phone call on the way here with a lot of my young organizers on college campuses across our country and i got a question from a young woman at another historically black college and university fayetteville  and i told her that i have a plan to help all of you afford to go to college  i have a plan to help all of you with student debt to pay it down and pay it off  and i have a special plan of a  billion fund specifically aimed at supporting hbcus   because we need a lot of opportunities for young people from everywhere it shouldnt matter what you look like where youre from or who you love you deserve to be in college if that is your choice  so right now were up and running were organizing across america and as jordan said this election has such high stakes but the highest stakes are for young people young people across america this election is going to determine in so many ways what kind of futures you will have i dont say that lightly everybody always says every election is important i happen to believe that i think its one of the great gifts of our democracy that we have the opportunity to choose our leaders and people brave people going back for so many years have fought to preserve that right and that right is under attack right now and it is under attack in north carolina of all places a state that often set the standard for moving everybody into the future and i admired that so much emphasis on education from literally preschool through college emphasis on research emphasis on job creation and innovation and now north carolina under the current governor and legislature has been trying to restrict peoples right to vote well you know it north carolina voters though won an important victory when a federal court just struck down this states voter id law  and the federal court brought back more days of whats called onestop early voting and heres what the court said this is not me talking this is what the federal court said the court said the north carolina law was designed to target africanamericans with almost surgical precision now thats not just happening in north carolina unfortunately its happening across america and courts have been overturning restrictions that make it harder not just for africanamericans but lowincome people latinos young people one of the provisions in the north carolina law was to make it really hard to vote where you go to school so this has been a concerted effort to undermine the right to vote even to make it hard for people with disabilities to cast ballots well whats the best way to repudiate that kind of underhanded meanspirited effort to deprive people of their votes get out and vote and make it clear were not putting up with that  these laws are a blast from the jim crow past and they have no place in st century america  we should be doing everything we can to make it easier to vote not harder thats why if im elected president i will work to expand early voting we will enact universal voter registration so every young person in every state is automatically registered to vote when you turn   and we will repair the damage done to the voting rights act and take on discrimination in all forms now hb two is another example of trying to discriminate against people that doesnt have any place in our modern society youve seen this firsthand in north carolina discrimination is not only wrong its bad for business the nba you know canceled the game paypal canceled bringing i think  jobs others are not coming to this beautiful state because they dont want to be associated with the discriminatory bigoted policies of your governor and legislature now one thing you can do about that is change your governor in november  and while youre at it change one of your senators  were going to need reenforcements up in washington weve got a big agenda and you know people say to me well what is it youre going to try to get done well ill show you real easy we just published a book right tim kaine and i put this book out its called stronger together its not very long not a hard read but we have this oldfashioned idea that if were asking you to support us as president were ought to tell you what were going to do  not just bluster not just empty words not just demagogic rhetoric real plans that will improve your lives make our country safer and better  so you can pick this up were going to build an economy that works for everyone not just those at the top sounds like a good idea  were going to make the biggest investment in good paying jobs since world war ii infrastructure advanced manufacturing clean energy jobs were going to make the economy fairer raise the national minimum wage get people to work full time out of poverty and we are finally going to guarantee equal pay for womens work it is long overdue  did any of you see the democratic convention well i dont know you might have missed one of my favorite sets of speakers we had these two young people from kansas  years old young man young woman id read about this and i said lets contact these young people and find out their story heres their story seventeen had the same summer job knew each other working in a pizza restaurant and they were pretty excited i remember when i got my first real job not babysitting but you know actually showing up at a job and having to do it and so one day after they finished work they were talking and the young woman said you know i think making  an hour i should be able to at least save something for college and the young man a friend of hers said well im making  an hour and she said well why are you making  cents more an hour than i am neither of us had any experience to do this job were the same age he said well i dont know that doesnt sound right maybe there was a mistake so they go to the manager they tell the manager and the manager fired them both and you know what thats legal if you find out youre not being paid the same for doing the same job you can be fired so this is not some madeup problem and this would raise family incomes and if you have a mother a wife a daughter or a sister whos working its your issue so were going to get that done as well and like i said were going to make college affordable for everybody pay down debt but were going to do something else i think it was a mistake when we got rid of all vocational education in high school  it needed to be improved dont get me wrong it wasnt training people for the jobs that were out in the marketplace anymore but we got rid of all of it we need technical education in high school we need more apprenticeship programs where young people can learn and earn at the same time and were going to go back to emphasizing that in high school community colleges apprenticeship programs creative ideas like coding camps were going to have  million jobs in  for people who have computer science skills and were going to only  if we continue on our present path only have  americans prepared to do those jobs i want those jobs to be american jobs so were going to help train people of all ages to be able to do those jobs we are also going to defend quality affordable health care for everybody but were going to get the cost down were going to get the cost of prescription drugs down for sure  and were going to emphasize two things that we have fallen short on mental health and addiction services  people ive met here in north carolina and across the america talk to me about that all the time so again weve got our ideas in here we want you to engage with us give us your ideas this needs to be an ongoing conversation we want you to hold us accountable when were in that white house trying to do all of this but we also have to keep america safe and we have to lead the world with steadiness and strength now one of the biggest differences in this campaign is donald trump basically says i alone can fix it whatever it is think of who that leaves out that leaves out our troops on the front line it leaves out our police and fire responders to emergencies it leaves out our teachers our educators who are working to help young people it leaves out everybody i alone can fix it i was raised to believe that were in this together and together we can fix it and that is exactly what were going to do  thats why tim kaine and i are running a campaign of issues not insults  donald trump has a different approach he wants to build an economy that works even better for himself starting with a  billion tax cut for his own family hes built a career on stiffing workers mom and pop contractors small businesses that did jobs for him and then he refused to pay them i take this very personally my father was a small businessman thats how he provided a good middle class living for us he printed drapery fabrics he would get the fabric and roll it out on these big long tables you take a silk screen and youd put it down youd dump the paint in youd take the squeegee youd go across youd lift it up youd down the end of one table start at the end of the other table youd do it until the job was done sometimes i would be there helping him and then he would load the fabric into his car and he would deliver it i tell you what i am a so grateful he never had a contract with donald trumps businesses  in fact i just ran across the story in las vegas when i was there a few weeks ago of a small drapery business who got what they thought was the greatest contract ever for trumps new hotel in las vegas they delivered the goods and they were refused payment for no reason other than its a game to him everything is a game its like hes living in his own celebrity reality tv program you know what donald this is real reality this is real people this is real decisions that have to be made for our country  he actually stood on a debate stage and said wages are too high in america now hes got some new advisers hes had a bunch of advisers hes got new advisers and theyre all trying to make him look more presidential sound more serious its not working too well but remember what maya angelou who spent the last years of her life right here in this state at wake forest reminded all of us  i think about it often i was so privileged to know her when someone shows you who they are believe them the first time  you know stronger together also means working together with our true allies and partners around the world and last night i offered some thoughts about isis iran how were going to reform the va system to take better care of our vets and just since last night when i appeared on that program backtoback with trump just in the last  hours more retired generals and admirals have signed up to support my campaign  people who have sacrificed and spent their lives protecting our country valuing what makes us exceptional and already great see donald trump and know he should not be anywhere near the white house he is temperamentally unfit to be president and commander in chief  now tomorrow i will hold  i will hold a meeting of bipartisan bipartisan which is what i want to get us back to where republicans and democrats work together to make the changes to protect our country im going to be meeting with a bipartisan group of leaders and experts to focus more on these crucial challenges but its hard to forget what trump did last night it was a test and he failed it he trash talked about americas generals saying that theyve been quote reduced to rubble he suggested he would fire them all and hand pick his own generals since you know he knows so much about what it takes to be a general he attacked dozens of former flag officers at the same time  and heres what i want you to really hear because even i was shocked by this and i didnt know much could shock me coming out of his mouth anymore he praised russias strong man vladimir putin even taking the astonishing step of suggesting he prefers the russian president to our american president that is not just unpatriotic its not just insulting to the office and the man who holds the office it is scary it is dangerous  it actually suggests he will let putin do what putin wants and even make excuses for him i said this morning i  i was trying to think about what other presidents would be imagining hearing that coming out of the nominee for the republican party what would ronald reagan say about a republican nominee who attacks americas generals and heaps praise on russias president weve never seen anything like this and one thing you didnt hear from him was any plan to take on isis one of the biggest threats facing our country he says his plan is still a secret well the truth is he doesnt have a plan  i served  i served on the senate armed services committee i served as secretary of state as you know i respect the men and women who put their lives on the line for the country that i love and that i believe in  so whether youre passionate about more good jobs better education healthcare whether youre passionate about protecting our country and the brave men and women who serve us you have to realize as so many republicans are that this is a time to put country over party i would be saying that even if i were not running against him we have never been threatened as much by a single candidate running for president as we have been in this election as your commanderin chief i will not trash our countrys most cherished values i will defend them  and that is especially on my mind because this weekend is the th anniversary of  i was a senator serving and i will never forget the horror of that day or the bravery of our first responders the victims the survivors people i had the honor to work with and represent its what kept me really so passionately involved on behalf of the people that i served all during those years and that is what i was thinking of  years later in the white house situation room i was part of the small group advising president obama whether or not the intelligence we had was good enough to take a chance to go deep into pakistan to try to finally bring osama bin laden to justice it was not an easy choice by any means these never are thats why who sits at the head of that table in the situation room has to be able to sort out fact from opinion has to be able to ask the hard questions pursue even the most difficult leads we went through that hour after hour after hour and then the president went around the table asking each of us what we advised and we were split because it was not some kind of easy layup i believed it was strong enough that we needed to take action and i supported taking action that would determine whether or not we were successful that meant sending in special forces now you know what happened i was in that situation room watching that day the most stressful  minutes of my life probably because you remember one of the helicopters nicked  clicked on  hit its tail on the wall going into the courtyard and became disabled that meant  thank goodness there were good contingency plans but you had to get another helicopter in to take out the seals who would no longer be able to fly out on that one but heres what i want to tell you because it is a story that to me illustrate our values in such a clear unambiguous way youve heard donald trump say he would order our troops to torture youve heard him say he would order our troops to kill family members of terrorists you would know that he was advocating illegal actions against our own laws as well as the laws of war thank goodness theres a code of honor in our military stronger than the bluster and the bullying of donald trump because here is what happened on that night  every single second counted that helicopter had to be blown up but before it was  and remember the seals had gone in they had taken out the two kuwaitis the bodyguards they had taken out bin ladens son who was there they took out bin laden they had to get his body out they had to get themselves out but heres what they did first they rounded up all the women and children members of terrorists families they took them outside as far from the helicopter as they could get them in order that they would not be hurt that donald trump is what american honor looks like and that is what were going to stand up and defend in the face of your outrageous disgraceful attacks on the men and women of our armed forces  were going to unify this country my friends we are going to bring us back together we are going to get things done big things thats who we are as americans i cant do any of this unless you join me in this campaign you can start by going to hillaryclintoncom or texting join join to  you can knock on doors you can make phone calls register your friends to vote attend a house party in your neighborhood were going to keep asking for your help over these next two months there is so much at stake in north carolina and in america no one can sit on the sidelines the stakes are high for everyone join the campaign lets build a future where were stronger together thank you"
17,"Clinton","before they cast their votes early or on november th so we will continue to highlight the differences and talk about what we want to do thats going to make life better for the families of america    all right and im sorry guys im working on a feature   well the middleclass is the social and economic engine of our country it is in so many ways a reflection of the success of the united states from the very beginning to create greater economic opportunity for people willing to work for it and it has been one of the premier historic accomplishments of our country going back decades if not longer and the middleclass is a hardtodefine economic target the way i talk about it is to say we know what the median income in america is but if youre living in highcost areas if you have kids youre trying to educate and send to college if you face healthcare costs that are beyond the average staying in and progressing up in the middleclass takes more money in some parts of america than it does in  so my pledge has been that i will not raise taxes on the middleclass and i have defined it as i will not raise taxes on anyone making less than  a year because in highcost places in america that is a  in many ways a cutoff that makes sense its something that president obama had adhered to its something my husband adhered to because when you look at the information and across the country i mean housing is so much more expensive in lots of places than other places and you understand why weve set it at that so the middleclass is both real and aspirational and i want to make sure that it remains strong and it gives people a sense of security and confidence and optimism about their futures    well look i am just going to keep running my campaign and do everything i can to encourage people to actually get out and vote i think either donald trump or i will be the president of the united states and so people have to look carefully in making their decision about who to vote for because it will be either him or me and i am going to do everything i can to make sure its me     i am thrilled of the amount of republican voter support ive gotten i really am and from people who understand the stakes in this election and are real thought leaders with a lot of experience so the  national security professionals who came out and said they could not support donald trump some months ago i think spoke volumes about his lack of fitness and qualifications for the job business leaders from mike bloomberg to meg whitman and so many others who understand what it will take to have a competitive economy that works for everybody not just those at the top theyve been on the front lines and we have an increasing number of people who actually been republican office holders one current one as you know congressman hanna from new york to then yesterday senator  former senator warner from virginia who i had the great honor of working with when he chaired the armed services committee so im really honored and proud to have the level of support and the message that it sends by people who understand what the next president is going to be facing and have said donald trump should not be anywhere near the oval office    oh is this your first flight   welcome aboard   he can run his campaign however he chooses thats up to him im going to keep talking about the stakes in this election im going to keep talking about my agenda that will i believe increase growth make it fairer have it be lasting deal with the real problems that families are confronting what i want to do to keep america safe and to provide the kind of steady strong leadership that the country needs and to bring people together which is going to be one of the highest priorities that i will have when im fortunate enough to be elected president if thats what turns out so you know im not going to comment on how he runs his campaign youll be able to see we have two more debates what he says and what i say    well you know look we have laws in our country and the efforts that trump was making to get into the cuban markets with his business interests ahead of the laws of the united states and the requirements that his businesses were operating under because of the sanction shows that he put his personal and business interests ahead of the laws and the values and the policies of the united states of america now i was a strong supporter of moving toward creating an opening with cuba when i was secretary of state i applauded president obamas efforts and i will continue those when i am president but donald trump knew what the law was and from everything we can tell by those investigative reporting that has been done he deliberately wanted it and why should it be surprising that somebody who is happy to give his tax returns to state agencies deciding whether he gets to have a casino but not with the american people and in fact says its smart not to pay taxes while he at the same time criticizes and denigrates the united states of america so i think its important for voters to see that this is someone who always puts himself first and even in the cubanamerican community there has been a change of opinion about whats the best way to bring freedom and democracy and human rights to cuba but there was also a very clear understanding of what our laws were and who they covered which was clear and unfortunately it looks like he didnt pay attention to them but why should we be surprised      no     no look he can say whatever he wants to say as we well know we have seen it in realtime over the last many months and im going to keep running my campaign talking about what i think the american people are interested in talking about how were going to make a difference in their lives i love the event i had with senator sanders yesterday in new hampshire i loved my college calculator i hope you all will write about it again because thats what i think people are looking for its how can we get our government working for you how can we help you deal with the everyday challenges you face and you know this amazing college calculator that our team put together will really provide good information and i want you to understand that is in line with what i want to do more of in the government we need to use technology more we need to get information out we need to have you know people be able to access easily information about government programs or costs or whatever it is thats on their minds so you know thats what im going to be doing im going to be talking about how we make college tuition free for under  per family and debtfree for everybody else i think that  i think thats what people care about   oh let me think look i like a lot of the world leaders one of my favorites is angela merkel because i think shes been an extraordinary strong leader during difficult times in europe which has obvious implications for the rest of the world particularly our country you know her leadership and steadiness on the euro crisis and her bravery in the face of the refugee crisis is something that i am impressed by ive known her for a long time she and i have known each other back in the s i spent a lot of time with her and i hope i have the opportunity to work with her in the future but we can talk about lots of different leaders if you want to"
18,"Clinton","hello  thank you    thank you so much   thank you   thank you so very much wow  what  what a wonderful welcome its great to be here in fort pierce in this beautiful theater  i love being in the sunshine state and  i really want to recognize a few people us congresswoman lois frankel is here as you saw  randy perkins a candidate for congress  kim johnson chair of the st lucie county commission  larry lee jr state representative  everyone all the elected officials all of the students and young people it is wonderful to be with you and i want to thank eileen for her introduction we know how hard nurses like eileen work  and now that she is retired she is volunteering for our campaign this woman never quit and eileen we are so glad you are on our team  i am grateful to all of the elected officials all of the commissioners the county commissioners martin county st lucie for all you do for the community but especially for all you did this summer to clean up the algae that polluted the water  that threatened wildlife and made life hard for local residents and businesses this is a serious complicated problem isnt it   for the entire treasure coast   and it is a reminder if we needed it how important good leadership is  so i thank all the leaders for their commitment now there are  days between now and november th  just  days left in the most important election in our lifetimes we have to make every single day count we have to get more people registered to vote get more people committed to turn out to vote we have to drive home the stakes in this election stronger family safer communities an economy that works for everyone not just those at the top  and underneath all of the rhetoric and the coverage and the back and forth this campaign really comes down to two questions what kind of future do we want for ourselves our kids and our grandkids and how do we make it a reality now as i said the other night how many of you saw the debate    well as i said i now have two grandchildren and no offense anybody the two most wonderful amazing extraordinary little girl and little boy and so i think a lot about the future and you may have noticed that my opponent and i have different views  about well nearly everything when it gets right down to it not just about what makes america great because i think america already is great  but about what we should do to make it even greater and about that basic question of how progress happens at all my opponent believes in what i call a strongman approach he stood on that stage at his convention and described a hopeless broken nation im sorry im looking at you i dont see that  that in no way resembles the strong vibrant america i know and  and here is what he said he said i alone can fix it  i alone well weve learned that thats his way one person getting supreme power and exercising it ruthlessly that is why he admires dictators like vladimir putin so much but that is now how change happens in america it is never just one person not even someone as powerful as the president every good thing our country has ever achieved has always happened because people have worked together to make it a reality  not just the wealthy or the powerful all of us we see that every day across america and i bet many of you have been part of it maybe youve taught kids to read right or cleaned up your local park or the beach maybe youve organized a cancer walk or youve run a food drive whatever it is chances are you have done something to serve your community and by extension your country how many of you just think back over your lives how many of you have performed some kind of service of some sort for your community for other people  the reason i know you have is because tens and tens of millions of americans do some kind of volunteering in your hometowns every single year it is one of the best things about the american people we are doers   you know we dont just shrug our shoulders when we see something that needs fixing we get resigned or apathetic or blame other people and turn on each to find scapegoats we roll up our sleeves we get to work to try to make things better in our neighborhood our community our city our state and our country that has been our story the american story since the beginning of our nation and it is still going strong today now for many americans including a lot of you here serving our country has included serving in our armed forces  people are starting to call out their services  there is no greater service or sacrifice and we are grateful to our men and women in uniform to their families and our veterans every single day  but whats so great is that national service can take many different forms and its something that i believe in so deeply that every stage of our lives gives us a chance from grade school through grandparenthood to find a way to give back weve got folks here today from americorps  which my husband created back in   and i will tell you to this day it is one of his proudest achievements because every day americorps members are there theyre building houses responding to natural disasters helping people with disabilities my jobs find safe places to live and next week on october th americorps will celebrate a major milestone their one millionth member  i will tell you  i will tell you bill is really excited about this and so am i and by the way americorps has one of the best swearingin pledges i have ever heard here is how it starts i will get things done for america isnt that great  i think we should make that a national slogan   now we also have folks here today from city year which is part of americorps  and every day theyre working with students who are at risk of dropping out of school theyre tutoring and mentoring and running after school clubs all to help young people really discover how capable they are and to be empowered and to stay in school i am really grateful to them we also have people here today from the peace corps which represents the best of america to the world  these corps volunteers are teaching english in kosovo  staffing health centers in nicaragua supporting farmers in nepal distributing malaria nets in uganda  both as first lady and as secretary of state i got to see the results of their work firsthand they are making the world a healthier more prosperous and more peaceful place now maybe not all of you have been a part of one of these programs but i know you serve in different ways maybe you volunteer through your school with your church or synagogue maybe you find through faithbased organizations as i did when i was a teenager service opportunities because for many americans service is part of our faith my running mate tim kaine volunteered in honduras with the jesuits as a young man and it changed his life or maybe your whole family volunteers together bill and chelsea and i every holiday season would work at a food bank back in arkansas however you serve it feels good doesnt it to be part of something bigger than ourselves  to take our time and labor and put it towards something good that can happen in our country and the world and you know something very interesting service makes us happier it makes us healthier and there are studies proving that its not just how we feel theyve actually followed people it can also help us find our next job or our true calling in life its a smart way to use our greatest asset our people and service does something important for us as a society too often we americans can become separated from each other and i think a lot of people are feeling this way during this election its easy to surround ourselves with only those who think like us talk like us look like us read the same news as us thats understandable to an extent but it comes with a cost because it magnifies our differences which then makes it harder to put those differences aside when our community or country needs us there arent many places where people of all ages all races all backgrounds all beliefs come together in common cause but service is one of them and thats one of the reasons i think its so valuable because in addition to the good work it does it helps us reconnect with each other to feel more a part of our shared american life i believe one of the jobs of the president is to encourage more service to help more americans answer president kennedys call you know it ask not what your country can do for you but what you can do for your country  but you know sometimes its hard to figure out how do you make a difference especially with everything else going on in our lives and too often volunteering becomes something only people with lots of time and financial security can do but thats not how it should be everyone should be able to contribute so what if we as a country made it easier for everybody to do that for everybody to give back what if we created more service opportunities for americans of all ages invested in programs that work and encouraged entrepreneurs to add a social component to their businesses what if we strengthen the culture of service in america    so it wasnt just something we did one day a year but it became a regular part of our lives i think that would reflect our values and tap into something so great about america  i talk a lot about how america is an exceptional nation were not exceptional just because of the size of our military or the size of our economy were exceptional because of the generosity and ingenuity of our people  way back  nearly  years ago a frenchman came to the united states his name was alexis de tocqueville he traveled around he was trying to figure out what is this new place called america they fought a revolution what are they doing who are they and he saw how we set up our government and we had three branches and everything that our founders really put into place but the thing that made the biggest impression on him was our spirit of volunteerism that made democracy as diverse and ambitious as ours possible if i am elected president this fall i want to build on that strength by making a major push in support of more national service  so here is what i plan to do first lets triple americorps  that was the goal of my friend and the great senator ted kennedy it was laid out in a law named in his honor the edward m kennedy service america act its finally time we get it done every year there are hundreds of thousands of more applications for americorps than there are spots in the program so if we grow the program from  annual members to  were going to give more people who already want to serve the chance to do so and then i want to double the college scholarships that americorps members earn through their service  and i want to find ways for more students to get college credit for service  because i know too many talented committed young people pass up on serving with americorps because with their student loan they cant afford it   so lets lighten that burden if you do national service we will began a program to forgive your loans because you are giving back to your country  and lets keep working for the ultimate goal of making it possible for any american to serve fulltime if they want to now second lets grow the peace corps  since president kennedy launched it  years ago its given nearly a quarter of a million americans the experience of a lifetime and it has fostered friendships and cooperation between americans and people in more than  nations weve got to do more of that in the world today we need more americans of all ages around the world showing our values serving people so lets make it possible for more americans to be a part of this extraordinary program  third lets expand service opportunities for people of all ages right now lets be fair the younger generation is way ahead on this ive talked to so many young people who are deeply thoughtful about how your lives impact others and the world service isnt just something to do to check a box before graduation it really is woven into your lives and many who are just getting started in your careers say that having a positive social impact is more important to you than getting a job that yes pay a salary but doesnt give you any meaning or purpose in your lives  and i love the fact that as you do service you come up with new ways of giving back and find a path into charities and nonprofit organizations and other ways to serve thats a sign of true commitment ive also been impressed by how many young entrepreneurs tell me that theyre building a social component into their businesses whether it is dedicating a portion of their profits to a charity giving employees time off to volunteer or adopting a school or community center as a pro bono project for the whole company thats why my plan to help you refinance and pay back your student loans includes loan forgiveness if you launch a social enterprise or start a business in an underserved community  we should make it easier for young innovators to follow their dreams while honoring their values and giving back now i also want to get older americans more involved service isnt something only students and young people do i know that so i intend to make sure that  percent of americorps slots go to americans over the age of   lets give people an encore opportunity after theyve ended their formal career so they can apply a lifetime of knowledge and experience toward a stronger community and finally i want to create a new means for people to serve in serious meaningful ways without a fulltime commitment you know americorps is a fulltime commitment the peace corps is a fulltime commitment the armed forces are a fulltime commitment but the armed forces has another model the reserves right it gives people the chance to make a highimpact contribution while still building careers and pursuing their dreams in other ways so lets do something like that in the civilian space lets call it the national service reserve  and heres the idea if you join the national service reserve you will receive some basic training just like you would in the military reserves and then when your city or state needs you youll get the call say a natural disaster strikes and the red cross needs all hands on deck or maybe like the crisis in flint and clean water has to be distributed every day to a lot of families or maybe your city launches a major public health campaign to reduce drug abuse or promote mental health you will then be sent into action  now some of these assignments may be just for a few days a month some might be longer term but they will directly address a vital need in your own community and what are the other advantages because you can help meet that need while still being a fulltime student having a job taking care of your family you wont have to make service your only priority our goal is  million people spread across all  states and  we will have an open door the people of all ages but we want to put a special focus on people under  whove said again and again they want to have a bigger impact in their communities but they cannot leave their jobs understandably well work with governors and mayors republicans and democrats because i want this to be a true bipartisan publicprivate partnership  i also want to include businesses colleges and universities who have unique resources to offer and because we want workers and students to know that as a they make this contribution their schools and their employers will have their backs i really think a national service reserve could make a difference for cities and states theres so much work to be done and so many people who want to help do it so lets bridge that divide get people working together in ways that can help communities now i do not think you will hear anything about this from my opponent  and you know what i think that is a shame because national service has always been a bipartisan goal  of course president kennedy started the peace corps and my husband started america corps but president nixon signed the domestic volunteer service act president george hw bush created the white house office of national service and both president george w bush and president obama have been huge champions of service this should be something that we all can get behind and  when you listen to what is being said in this campaign it can be discouraging right   it can seem hard to find any common ground so that makes it even more important that we come together wherever and whenever we can now i am well aware that candidates do not usually focus on national service in the final stretch of a hotly fought presidential election some might say well hey my gosh youve only got  days to go why arent you just out there you know beating up on your opponent and doing everything to get the vote out and all the rest of it well i will do that but   ive been thinking about this a long time and i did not want this campaign to end without talking about it because it means a lot to m im trying to end the campaign focusing on issues that are really close to my heart and this is one of them    thank you  you know for me service is really all about fulfilling the instruction of my methodist faith and you can see part of  the creed i like to follow behind me  do all the good you can in all the ways you can in all the places you can at all the times you can to all the people you

good  so there are lots of examples were gonna be putting examples up on my website of people who have served and who are inspirations but i want everybody here to know that it can be done we can do more and we can provide the opportunities to enlist more people there are so many examples in this community and communities across america thirtynine days left this is the choice do we lift each other up or do we tear each other down  do we listen and respect each other or do we scapegoat point fingers and insult each other well i tell you what side im gonna be on and with your help were

19,"Clinton","thank you wow hello akron wow i am so excited its just fabulous being back here again i am so grateful to all of you i want to thank your mayor mayor horrigan thank you for welcoming me here i want to thank two great members of congress who fight for akron fight for cleveland fight for youngstown fight for ohio and america congresswoman marsha fudge and congressman tim ryan  now im pretty excited about being here today and i was especially honored to receive the endorsement of lebron james  now i may become president but he will be king of ohio for as long as there is a king im obviously delighted to be endorsed by someone who has demonstrated such leadership and such extraordinary ability but ill tell you what really moved me the most is hes given back to his hometown  he has advocated for small businesses for kids given kids more opportunities hes spoken out on behalf of criminal justice reform he is someone who uses the platform he has earned because he has worked so hard over so many years to speak out and speak up for those who may not have a voice so i am truly honored to have his support and especially to be able to tell people in his hometown how i am looking forward not just to watch him play basketball but to continue to be a leader in so many different ways now we do  we do have an important election coming up  who here is planning to vote  well that is very good news because this is the most consequential election i think in our lifetimes the choice could not be clearer and we need everybody to show up and how many of you still have to register to

text join  join  at  and get involved because we are running to win ohio in this election    and you know everybody everybody in the campaign is crisscrossing ohio my daughter has been here a bunch  tim kaine and his wonderful wife ann have been here  my husband is coming back tomorrow for a twoday bus tour through ohio  and i will be back because we care about ohio and we want to make sure ohio makes the best choice for the future of the people of this great state  now im going to close this campaign the way that i started my career a long time ago fighting for kids and families standing up for people who may need a little extra boost in life making sure that this country delivers on the promise of the american dream see i believe the american dream is big enough for everybody  if youre willing to work for it and do your part you should be able to get ahead and stay ahead in america  now my opponent and i have a really different view about what it takes to get ahead and stay ahead and that may be because we have very different life experiences and you know thats ok people have different families different views of the world but heres what i have noticed i have noticed that he always puts himself first and maybe thats because he was born into a millionaire family he started his business with a  million loan from his father his father bailed him out apparently thats a pattern youve got to be bailed out when you do business with him and he then has taken advantage of every single element of our tax code of our economy that he could and along the way  along the way he has stiffed people small businesses and workers and contractors and thats part of the reason i take this election so seriously my dad was a small businessman my grandfather was a factory worker and so my dad when he got out of the navy in world war ii he started a small business he started a printing business he printed fabrics for draperies and you know he worked really hard he had a print plant in chicago no natural light no windows just a long room where there were two big long tables and the fabric would be laid out on them and then if youve ever seen silkscreens thats what he did you take the silkscreen you put it down you pour the paint in your take the squeegee you go across you lift it up you go down to the end of one long table you start on the end of the other long table and then if it was going to be two colors you would add another color doing exactly the same thing it was before there was machines my dad couldnt have afforded that anyway but he worked really hard and he produced a good middle class life for our family so when i think about the way that my opponent has taken advantage of people ive got to tell you i am really grateful my dad never got a contract from him  because i have met people he stiffed i have met people im talking painters and plumbers im talking dishwashers marble installers glass installers architects a man who sold him pianos for one of his casinos he wouldnt pay them now youve got to stop and ask yourself what kind of person does that somebody who works hard and has a contract which they expect to be honored and so i met one of the men i met a man who had a small family business installed the glass in one of those casinos submitted the bill and trump said no were not going to pay it and the man was stunned as so many hundreds and hundreds of people have been and then they come back the trump organization or trump himself and say ok well give you  cents  cents maybe  cents on the dollar now some of those small businesses couldnt afford that they had bought the material they had provided the services trump didnt care he basically just walked away from them made them feel like they had failed even though they had done the work theyd been asked to provide ive got to tell you that is not the way were supposed to do business in america and  and i cant imagine having a president who believes that thats the way youre supposed to treat people but youre going to help me make sure he never gets near the white house    now earlier today earlier today in toledo i talked about all of the changes i want to make in how we can protect americans from the kind of corporate fraud that we have seen too much of now the most recent example is wells fargo  wells fargo actually had people thousands of their employees putting customers into accounts they either never asked for or they did not understand and then every time they put somebody into a new account they got fees which then gave them the chance to get a bigger bonus a really crummy game that hurt people so thankfully we have an organization now the consumer finance protection bureau in washington that looks out for people who get defrauded like that  that is an important part of how we are going to protect people and it is run you may know by richard cordray from ohio  now will it surprise you that donald trump wants to eliminate that agency   well were not going to let that happen that agency has already recovered  billion for consumers who have been taken advantage of by corporations and the behavior of wells fargo shows clearly that we have got to keep the pressure on these big banks so they can never wreck the economy again the way they did back in   i have said we are never going to let wall street wreck main street again and i mean it contrast that  contrast that with my opponent he wants to do away with the rules that have been imposed on wall street he basically wants to let wall street the banks the hedge funds all these other institutions basically do whatever they want again i tell you what we are not going to let that happen we need more rules not fewer rules on them  i want us to make it easier to start a small business to get rid of the red tape to make credit available to make it clear that most new jobs are going to come from small businesses in america so we should have a big dynamic small business economy but we are not going to let big business and big corporations call the shots anymore that is not working for us  but trumps whole economic vision is really trickledown economics its the same idea that has failed us before you see he believes that all you do is cut taxes on the wealthy and then it trickles down well we know that doesnt work weve been down that road and what he wants to do is i think its fair to say trickle down on steroids  what he has proposed would slash taxes on the wealthy now im a little confused about this because for a long time weve been saying hey where are your tax returns  a lot of us wondered what he was hiding because you know if it was something that would make him look good he would put them right out there  everybody who has ever run for president in at least the last  years has released their tax returns my husband and i have about  years of tax returns out there you can go and look at them and you can see that you know we paid a lot of taxes and frankly we were grateful we could we are grateful for the blessings that we have had over the last  years  so did any of you see the debate last monday  well you know i raised it i said well ok what is he hiding maybe hes not as rich as he claims maybe he is not as charitable as he claims maybe he doesnt want us to see that he owes hundreds of millions of dollars to foreign banks and foreign lenders or maybe he hasnt paid any taxes now shortly after the debate it was discovered that indeed back in the s he apparently lost a billion dollars on bad investments and failing casinos  ask yourself this who loses money on casinos  really  and you know yesterday  yesterday some of his supporters said well it just shows that hes a genius that he didnt pay any taxes  well what kind of genius loses a billion dollars in the first place  you know in the debate he said not paying taxes made him smart  but think about what that means it means that all the rest of us who pay our taxes right whats he saying about us but more than that zero taxes means zero for our vets zero for our military zero for pell grants to send young people to college zero for health zero for education and you stop and ask yourself this is the same person whos been going around really just dumping on america he said our military is a disaster well he could not be more wrong but thank goodness the rest of us pay to support our men and women in uniform who have done so much for us  today in colorado he claims he brilliantly use the laws to avoid paying taxes well that just shows number one he is the poster boy  the poster boy for the same rigged system that he would make even worse just think about it he paid zero at least for about  years we believe now based on what we know and he is advocating for huge tax cuts that would help him and his family even more what does he want us to do pay him to lose money really  but you know   you know theres a lot more to this story and we are just slowly getting it into the public eye so we know he stiffed people didnt pay his bills we know he took bankruptcy depending on how you count four or six times you know that he paid no taxes for probably  years we dont know what his taxes would be after that he has always talked about how he cant release his taxes because he is under audit but he admitted everything before  is not under audit so donald release everything up until  show the american people your taxes  ill tell you another thing if i am  if i am fortunate enough to be president we are going to pass a law requiring anybody who is a nominee of a major national party to have to release their taxes  so what did we find out today well a story just came out saying that donald trump used chinese steel and aluminum for two out of the last three construction projects so instead of buying his steel and aluminum from american plants here in ohio and pennsylvania instead of supporting hardworking families and american jobs he once again stiffed us he sent that money overseas now he spends a lot of time bashing the chinese right you hear that all the time when he talks well turns out he bought his steel and aluminum from the chinese and it turns out he owes big money to the chinese so this is another one of the episodes of his reality television show where he is saying one thing and doing something else now for years china has been undermining american businesses and workers by illegally dumping cheap aluminum and steel into our markets you know that right and it sounds like donald trump has been buying that dumped steel and aluminum how can he make america great again when he wont even buy american products in our country  and ill tell you this is personal to me because as a senator i went before the international trade commission on behalf of steelworkers in new york who i represented and as secretary of state i went toe to toe with the chinese i have put forward an agenda to crack down on trade abuses from countries like china to stand up for american workers and to rebuild american infrastructure with american materials like steel and aluminum  and today in toledo i pointed out because chrysler just announced an expansion of the plant there for the new jeep wrangler about  more jobs right i pointed out when the automobile industry was flat on its back and  workers in ohio could have been absolutely out of a job more than we can even imagine in terms of a longlasting impact on the economy here donald trump said he didnt care save it dont save it didnt matter to him well ill tell you where i stood i stood in favor of saving the american automobile industry  and look what we got last year our auto industry had the best year they have had in a really long time and so we have got to keep building it weve got to keep making sure that there are good jobs and weve got to protect good union jobs against the kind of assault that is coming from all sides  so now i know that ohio is a tough state youve got to get out there and youve got to talk to people answer questions make your case thats what weve been doing thats what we are going to do all the way to the end of this election but i need your help to talk to anybody you know here who thinks they might be voting for trump  i know you know people i know you do and youve got to stage an intervention  youve got to sit them down and point out how everything he says he wants to do is absolutely opposite of what he has done and how everything he has proposed will help people like him and his family but not the vast majority of families in ohio in fact if you look at his tax proposals they benefit him and other wealthy people hedge fund managers and the like and they would actually raise taxes on the middle class families  now thats the kind of contrast we are getting out in the campaign but thats why we need your help to make sure you go out and talk to everybody and you know i know people want change thats part of the american dynamic spirit we want change but ill tell you one thing that is certain is we will have change its just what kind of change its whether or not we have change that helps the vast majority of americans hardworking americans middleclass families or continues to only help those at the top i want an economy that works for everyone not just those at the top  and thats exactly what we are going to fight for and that is what we are going to get i tell you ive been called a lot of things right ive never been called quitter if i tell you im going to get up every day and fight for you that is exactly what i will do  but i know i cant do it  i cant do it alone you know donald trump stood on the stage of his convention and just once again painted this dark and dire picture of america and he said i alone can fix it he gets confused between leadership and dictatorship  he has a hard time remembering who our friends are and who our adversaries are he has a weird fascination with dictators like vladimir putin we have a lot of people living in this part of ohio who either themselves or their parents or grandparents came from countries that were under the yoke of oppression and we are never going to let that happen again  and so when trump basically signs up for putins wish list thats bad enough but then when he is cavalier  and im not talking about basketball  when he is cavalier about nuclear weapons saying that he doesnt care if other countries get them in fact you know if there were nuclear war in east asia japan got nuclear weapons if south korea got nuclear weapons hey you know go at it folks he even said he wouldnt care if saudi arabia got nuclear weapons one thing that has been a bedrock of american foreign policy through democratic and republican presidents going back to the dawn of the atomic age is we were committed to try and keep other countries from getting access to nuclear weapons to be able to stop proliferation and now its even more important because its not only states that we have to worry about like north korea weve got to worry about terrorists getting their hands on nuclear weapons the last thing we want to do is just act like it doesnt matter because it does i was involved in putting together the sanctions against iran that drove them to the negotiating table and what i learned  if you use diplomacy and youre tough about it you can actually get an agreement to put a lid on their nuclear program and we are going to make sure they follow it to the period the comma everything in that agreement im going to enforce  and we still have challenges with iran but i think we are in a stronger position given the fact that they are not racing for a nuclear weapon because we have intrusive inspections so i know diplomacy can work because i have done it and i know that  we can defeat isis and the terrorists if we work with other nations if we have a coalition that actually takes them out from the air takes them out on the ground and fights them online where they are doing so much damage by radicalizing and recruiting young people  ive been laying out my plan for what i think it will take to defeat isis and i have no doubt we will and donald says he has a secret plan that he wont tell us about well theres no secret he has no plan weve got to do more  weve got to do more to make sure we protect our country we need the best intelligence we can get the best cooperation among law enforcement at all levels of government i will not rest you know as a former senator from new york on  i take this as a personal responsibility i will do everything i can to keep our country safe and to work with others to defeat the threat posed by terrorism  finally my friends weve got to bring our country back together  there is too much divisiveness too much fingerpointing and scapegoating you know our diversity is one of our strengths  we have to listen to each other we dont have to agree thats not required but we need to be respectful we need to listen and then we need to roll up our sleeves and get to work when i was first lady senator secretary of state i worked to find common ground with everybody i worked when i was first lady with republicans and democrats to create the childrens health insurance program that ensures  million kids  when i was in the senate i worked with practically every republican i served with and you know they all have nice things to say about me when i am not running for something  and i will work again to move our country forward and to change the economy so it works better for hardworking people and when i was secretary of state we negotiated a treaty with russia to lower nuclear weapons to try to lower the threat of that and we had to get  republicans and i worked tirelessly and we got them we did that theres a lot we can do if we start listening and respecting each other and avoid the kind of namecalling and insults that we see too much of  so im excited about the campaign but im even more excited about getting to work for you being able to get up every day and find a way to try to help somebody i mean that is how i was raised in my church and by my family and that is what i have done through my advocacy work and my legal work on behalf of people who needed a voice and i will do everything possible to make sure i deliver results for you and the reason the reason that i have published a book with my great running mate tim kaine  its right here  is real simple i want you to know what we say we are going to do because i want you to hold me accountable  i dont believe in bait and switch where i say we are going to do something and then i am really over here doing something else that kind of reminds you somebody doesnt it no heres what were going to try to do were going to pay for it by raising taxes on the wealthy and closing loopholes on corporations  and i am the only candidate who ran this whole campaign saying i will never raise taxes on the middle class that is not going to happen when i am president so please join this campaign the last  days talk to your friends remember friends dont let friends vote for trump  i am motivated every day because now i am a grandmother two beautiful grandchildren and i think about their future i think about their lives i think about our country i want our country to be the land of opportunity the place where dreams do come true if you are willing to work for them not just for my grandchildren but for every child i want every child in this country to have a chance to live up to his or her godgiven potential and if you will help me win this election and then help me work to make it come true we will have a country that delivers on our dreams and a future we can all be proud of thank you and god bless you"
20,"Clinton","thank you  thank you wow well i dont know about you but i could listen to elizabeth go on all day  it is so great being here back in new hampshire  i have a significant unruly group of women i went to wellesley with back here  oh and its wonderful to be on this college campus and to see so many young people here as maggie and elizabeth and i were walking out to the stage a lot of folks were hanging out of the windows and were glad that youve got the best view of what were doing here its also exciting to be here with two weeks left because this is the most consequential election of our lifetime and to see the energy and the enthusiasm that this crowd displays  i saw it yesterday in north carolina i saw it the day before in ohio it really does demonstrate that americans are looking at whats at stake and are coming to the conclusion that we all have to be involved involved in the remaining days of the campaign and that everyone needs to turn out to vote and here in new hampshire you have a lot of reasons to vote youve got great candidates for the congress annie kuster and carol shea porter who deserve your support  and youve got a great candidate for governor colin van ostern thank you  i know that  you know maggie and elizabeth and i have been out here giving the full dose but i hope you will also make sure people know whats at stake in the governors race and in sending these two extraordinary women to the house and boy it is exciting to be here with maggie and elizabeth because they are people who fight for you every single day i know both of these women and it is a privilege to be on this stage with them now elizabeth warren has a track record of making it her mission to stand up against wall street and shes going to make sure that wall street never wrecks main street again  but you may not know that she was the person behind setting up the agency that protects consumers the consumer financial protection bureau and it was set up to stand against and do something about the kinds of fraud and abuse weve seen from wells fargo and they are on the front lines of returning billions of dollars to americans who have been cheated and defrauded by big companies by banks and others  you know in fact i think its fair to say some of the best tv that you can see is on cspan when elizabeth is going after a bank executive or a regulator  shes refusing to let them off the hook and shes not just speaking for herself is she   she is speaking for every single american who is frustrated and fed up and i am so looking forward to working with her to rewrite the rules of our economy to make sure we both grow it and make it fairer for every single person working hard here in america  i dont know  were up here without our phones so we cant check tweets but  i kind of expect if donald heard what she just said hes tweeting away she gets under his thin skin like nobody else  whether shes calling him out about his mysterious tax returns she exposes him for what he is  temperamentally unfit and totally unqualified to be president of the united states  and maggie is going to be a great united states senator for new hampshire  you know you dont have to take my word or elizabeths word look at what she has already done under maggies leadership new hampshire has the lowest unemployment rate in the entire country  during her governorship it was ranked as the best state in the country for business and shes done it the new hampshire way she has brought people together democrats republicans and independents i think she has the biggest legislature probably in the world that she has to deal with so she has really honed her skills about listening and then trying to work with people and shes taken on issues that really do keep families up at night from the skyrocketing costs of college and prescription drugs to helping students figure out ways to afford to get their education to helping those suffering from addiction or mental health to raising wages for hardworking families what i love about maggie is that she is independent she knows how to find common ground and how to stand her ground and that is exactly the kind of leader we need in the united states senate  because weve got to break through the gridlock and the dysfunction that has unfortunately marred washington we have got to get back to listening respectfully we can disagree without being disagreeable and thats why we need leaders like maggie and unlike her opponent she has never been afraid to stand up to donald trump  she knows he shouldnt be a role model for our kids or for anybody else for that matter so i hope in these next  days you do everything you can to support her and i want to say a word about colin who i have also known for a number of years now and maggie is leaving some big shoes  she doesnt look like it but she is shes leaving some big shoes to fill as governor and colin is the person for that job you know as a member of the executive council and i remember this because it took a lot of guts he helped lead the fight to protect funding for planned parenthood in new hampshire  against his opponent by the way and he has shown that he will stand up for womens health  percent of the time not just when its politically convenient he also worked with maggie to cross party lines to help expand medicaid to more than  granite staters  and colin wants to do more to invest in clean energy like wind and solar to hold down energy costs to create more good jobs here in new hampshire and to protect the beautiful environment of this state and he will fight to put into action the promise of higher education within reach for more families so please during these next days make sure youre doing everything you can for colin for carol and for annie  now did anybody see the last debate   you know i stood next to donald trump in three debates for four and a half hours proving once again that i have the stamina to be president  i tried to use the time i had in all three to talk about what people talk to me about starting here in new hampshire and going across the country because i take it really seriously i think the problems that keep you up at night that stand in the way of your getting ahead and staying ahead of providing the best opportunity of a good middleclass job with a rising income for you and your kids those are the problems that someone running for president should actually listen to pay attention to and come up with solutions for  so you know i do have a lot of plans i do and i get criticized for having so many plans tim kaine and i have actually written a book  oh theres one copy right there its called  oh another copy its called stronger together and we lay out all of our plans for what we want to do if were so honored as to be president and vice president  and you know i do have this old fashioned idea that if im here asking for your vote to be your president i should tell you what im going to do and  and maybe as i said yesterday in north carolina maybe it is a bit of a womans thing because we make lists  we do we make lists and we try to write down what were supposed to do and them cross them off as we go through the day and the week and so i want you to think about our plans as our lists our list as a country we are going to get the economy working for everybody not just those at the top we are going to make college affordable we are going to lower prescription drug costs and were going to do everything we can to keep faith with what we have said were going to do what a novel idea were actually going to try to deliver results for you  but i got to tell you during that debate donald said something  well he said a lot of things that were troubling but he said something truly horrifying he became the first person running for president republican or democrat who refused to say that he would respect the results of this election now that is a direct threat to our democracy im not going to try to call it anything else because thats what it is all this talk about the election being rigged trying to stir up people who are supporting him at his rallies that is a direct threat to our democracy and i got to tell you as your secretary of state i went to  countries and i went to countries where people were jailed for being political opponents where they were exiled where they were killed i take this really seriously and for me the peaceful transfer of power is one of the things that makes our country great something that   something we cant lose something we shouldnt even doubt we cannot give into cynicism and i dont think we are ill tell you whats exciting to me is across this country at the very moment when donald trump is making this unprecedented attack on our fundamental values our institutions millions of people are standing up for democracy registering volunteering voting early  so when you get a little discouraged or you get frustrated by what you see in this campaign think of this we have just reached a historic milestone more than  million americans are now registered to vote  and most exciting that includes more than  million young people the biggest number ever  now you only see numbers like this when people are standing up for what they believe in and im proud to see americans coming together democrats republicans independents to reject hate and division and you know were seeing that in new hampshire too we are more than our disagreements we americans there is so much more that unites us than divides us im proud to have the support of more than  republican leaders in this state who put country before party  but this energy were seeing is not just because of what were against as important as that is its because what were for its about fighting for a future where everyone counts where everyone has a place and no one is left out or left behind because to me  and i hope to you as well  this is about more than winning an election its about the kind of country we want for our kids and our grandkids thats what this has to be about  its about the lessons we want to pass on to our sons and our daughters you know we believe we should honor the men and women who fight for our country and that america is safer when we work with our allies to lead the world with strength and intelligence yet my opponent attacked a grieving gold star family whose son died in iraq he has no plan to defeat isis and just last night he tweeted that the new effort underway to push the terrorists out of the key city of mosul is already and i quote a total disaster and that our country is quote looking so dumb  imagine imagine you know this is a guy who says he knows more about isis than the generals i dont think so hes basically declaring defeat before the battle has even started hes proving to the world what it means to have an unqualified commanderinchief its not only wrong its dangerous and it needs to be repudiated on november th here in new hampshire and across america  but just in case you think that this is new for donald it shouldnt surprise you or surprise anybody else and ill tell you why he has been denigrating america for decades it started before he ran against me it started before president obama took office in fact back in  he spent  on an ad in the new york times criticizing president reagan he said and i quote the world is laughing at america does that sound familiar this is someone who roots for failure and takes glee in mocking our country no matter who our president is now that may be who donald trump is but this election is about who we are and i want us  i want us to remember america is great because america is good right  and as our wonderful first lady michelle obama said right here in new hampshire when they go low we go high  this election poses a very clear choice on the economy when the middle class thrives america thrives as elizabeth said she is a perfect example of how that works in america so am i so are every one of you here thats what i want for every single person especially young person in america with your help were going to not only have elizabeth back in the senate but send maggie send carol send annie and then make the biggest investment in new jobs since world war ii  what does that mean that means jobs and infrastructure our roads our bridges our tunnels our ports our mass transit our water system theres a lot of great work to be done here and guess what those are jobs that cant be exported theyve got to be done right here in new hampshire and across america  i want us to invest in advanced manufacturing and there are i know a lot of skeptics about that they say well we cant compete in manufacturing any more well ill tell you what i dont want us competing with low wage jobs i want us competing for the high wage jobs germany is a major exporter of advanced manufacturing products i want to compete with germany and countries like that precision machining d printing  i want us to invest more in technology innovation and research and yes in clean energy because were going to make america a clean energy super power of the st century  i think we can deploy a half a billion more solar panels within the first four years and enough clean energy to power every home by the end of  years thats what i want people to be working on and thinking about and striving to achieve  and i am really excited about what we can do to make sure every young american is prepared i want to start in the early years of life in early education universal prek i want kids to be prepared to succeed   because we are in a competition and you know what i want us to step up and compete and win and i want our schools i want kids to have good teachers and good schools in every zip code and i want to be a good partner with our teachers and our educators here in new hampshire  and i want to bring back technical education to high school i think we really  we really shut the door on too many young people who could have gotten skills that would have given them the chance to get ahead and working with our community colleges we need to make sure that every young person and every person coming back to upgrade or change skills can go to a community college and yes we are going to make fouryear college affordable you know just this week a new report came out showing that new hampshire students have very high levels of debt and i know maggie has been fighting that and shes had a moratorium and shes done what she could at the state level but we got to work together at the national level to make this happen for students in new hampshire families in new hampshire  so after our primary was over and  you know what i was really proud i was really proud of the campaign that bernie sanders and i ran and it was a  it was a campaign   it was a campaign about ideas not insults and thats what campaigns should be about and after it was over bernie and i got together we put our heads together and we came up with a plan to make public colleges and universities tuitionfree for any families making less than  a year  and if you make more than that it will be debtfree in other words pay what you can but lets not have kids and families going into debt to get an education this should be an investment that we make on behalf of them and our countrys future  and no matter where you go to a great school like this or anywhere else we will help you pay down your student debt well make it easier because were going to make it as a percentage of your income so youre never on the hook for more than you can afford and if youre interested to see how much you and your family could save you can actually go to hillaryclintoncomcalculator to see how much you can save under this plan that we are proposing  now i think in addition to growing the economy we need to do a lot more on small business twothirds of new jobs will come from small business so were going to be just focused on how we make it possible to start and grow your small business and then we do  we do have to make the economy fair and that starts with raising the national minimum wage because if you work fulltime im talking about fulltime workers you shouldnt still be in poverty at the end work should provide a ladder of opportunity for people willing to work for it to climb right  and we are going to guarantee equal pay we are going to make affordable childcare so nobody pays more than  percent of your income for childcare were going to work for paid family leave because this is the way families are today you know were not living in the s families are under new stresses and strains and i meet so many who are really just at the edge they are making all they can make one parent working fulltime two parents working fulltime sometimes parttime on top of fulltime and the other day tim kaine and i were in pittsburgh and there was a long line of people a big overflow which you know we couldnt get into the main room where we were so tim was talking to the families there and there was a woman there holding her yearold child a daughter i think and you know tim was shaking hands and the woman looked he said i  she said i came here hoping i could tell you or secretary clinton that i had my baby three years ago and the day after i had my baby i was fired because i called and asked if i could have a few weeks because it had been a difficult pregnancy and my baby was fine but not all that she needed to be i got fired and tim came in and you know hes such a wonderful man what a fine fine human being  and he said to me you know there are reasons every day why i get so motivated in this election and i just  i just have another reason and he told me that story i think your president should care about that i think your president should wake up every day thinking ok how do i help empower people to make the most out of their own lives you know how do i knock down the barriers that give you the chance to go as far as your hard work and talent will take you and then sometimes people say well how are you going to get all this done and  i have proposed plans that do not add a penny to the debt because i see some of my longtime friends who were back in the  campaign and you know when my husband ended up we had a balanced budget and a surplus  and actually we were on the way to paying down the national debt but heres what happened what happened is tickledown economics came back so heres what im gonna do were going to ask the wealthy to finally pay their fair share  were going to  were gonna close the loopholes we are going to end the fact that millionaires can pay a lower tax rate than a nurse or a teacher or a police officer were gonna make big banks pay for the risks they pose to our economy because elizabeth is absolutely right no  no bank is too big to fail and no one should be above the law  so were going to enforce that and contrast that with donald trump he believes if you give trillions  and thats trillions with a t  in tax cuts to the wealthy millionaires billionaires and corporations everything will work well it will for him thats trickledown economics on steroids and he would wipe away the tough new rules that president obama imposed on wall street he would eliminate the consumer financial protection bureau that elizabeth did so much to create  and you know that was bad enough but then in the debates we learned he has not paid any income tax for years  so he hasnt paid a penny to support our military our veterans pell grants for kids to get an education health or anything else and his explanation was well he lost  billion in a year now ive pondered this ive really pondered this he actually said it made him smart not to pay income taxes but how smart are you to lose  billion in a year  and  i dont  has anybody here ever been to a casino he lost  billion running casinos who does that ive never heard of anybody  so weve got to make it clear that donald is not on the side of american workers or american families you know for all of his talk about putting america first he makes his products in at least  other countries he stiffs small businesses momandpop contractors who work for him my dad was a smallbusiness owner he worked really heard im just glad he never got a contract from donald trump because it was hard work and people who do that work should be rewarded not taken advantage of so we  we know a lot about how donald trump works and today  today we heard yet another story its about a maintenance worker at one of his golf courses this maintenance worker told his coworkers he was gay and they started harassing him they used antigay slurs to his face they threw rocks and golf balls at him his supervisors saw it and did nothing and it got so bad he wound up in the hospital finally he went to the police for help he couldnt go back to work because he was too scared for his safety and then he was fired by trumps golf club now this is a heartwrenching story on a lot of levels for starters it is a painful reminder of the harassment violence and discrimination that too many lgbt americans still face every day  and it is deeply disturbing that instead of stepping in to stop the tormentors trumps golf club turned on the victim for coming forward  if thats how donald trump runs his business what does that say about how he would run our country so my friends there are lots of reasons so many to take this election seriously but here what i want you to know of course i want you to vote for all of us but more than that i want you to vote for yourselves and for your families and for your hope for our future together  because if you believe women and girls should be treated with dignity and respect and that women should be able to make our own health care decisions and that marriage equality should be protected and that we have to take on the epidemic of substance abuse disorders and addictions if you believe in a foreign policy where we work with our allies not insult them and achieve common goals toward peace and prosperity then you have to vote all of these issues are on the ballot this november and i believe with all my heart that we will after this election get together to help heal the divides that have sprung up and are so painful among us  so please register and vote on the same day go to iwillvotecom to confirm your polling place come help us these last two weeks go to hillaryclintoncom sign up to volunteer take out your phone text join  join to  and get everybody you know to come out and vote i think this election is going to turn on who is motivated to vote so we need each and every one of you to do everything you can to make it clear to everybody you know that our future is at stake if you want to be part of a positive optimistic confident unifying future please come out and vote on november th here in new hampshire and prove once and for all that love trumps hate  thank you all"
21,"Clinton","thank you so much   thank you wow thank you all what a great way to celebrate my birthday being here in tampa  i am so so grateful to jose for that wonderful introduction hes an incredibly talented chef but more than that i have to say hes a humanitarian he just came back from haiti once again where he goes periodically to help feed people hes been doing it ever since the terrible earthquake going to help people in remote villages and he does that all over the world when it comes to making sure that there are clean cook stoves so that people can cook primarily women and children without fear of getting sick from inhaling all the smoke i enlisted joses help when i was secretary of state on the clean cook stoves initiative and as you heard hes also a proud immigrant and  he is standing up to donald trumps antiimmigrant rhetoric and hes doing it in a very courageous way because he sacrificed his business hed been asked by the trump organization to put a restaurant into the new hotel that trump was talking about on tv today in washington and after jose heard the kinds of things that donald trump was saying about immigrants he said no i refuse to open a restaurant in that hotel  that is really gutsy and today was as perfect time to have jose be with us because as i said donald trump is taking time off the campaign trail to officially open the hotel and yesterday here in florida he took time out to invite the press to listen to his employees talk about what a great boss he is while he was watching and listening to them and today in opening that hotel i think its important to note that he once again relied on undocumented workers the same people he has been insulting and demonizing throughout this campaign so like with so much else that donald trump says he says one thing and then he does something different many of the products in the hotel were made overseas rather than here in the united states and he even sued the district of columbia to pay lower taxes that is the way that he does business now  weve actually learned in this campaign that donald trump is the poster boy for everything wrong with our economy  he refuses to pay workers and contractors from atlantic city to miami to las vegas he stiffs small businesses i take that one personally because my dad was a small business man and ive met so many people who did projects for donald trump you know provided pianos for one of his casinos installed drapes for one of his hotels laid the marble put in the glass washed the dishes painted and then werent paid  i just think that is fundamentally wrong and that is not the kind of experience we need in the oval office so im grateful to jose and i want to thank everyone else my great friend your united states senator bill nelson  congresswoman kathy castor  mayor bob buckhorn whos here with his two daughters  governor charlie crist soon to be congressman charlie crist  i have to say weve got two great candidates here david singer candidate for the house of representatives and rena frazier another candidate and we have the great talent of angela bassett with us today  so my friends heres the advice that i got it is a beautiful day in tampa but its warm and some of you have been here a while right and im watching the flags so long as theyre waving i know theres a breeze if they stop waving im really going to cut this short but let me start by thanking you thanking you for being here and    thank you thank you well ill tell you if i ever need a you know pickup im coming back to tampa mayor  and you know with  days left in this election we cannot stop for a minute no complacency here nobody  nobody flagging weve got to get everybody out to vote and i hope in addition to the people that i mentioned someone whos not here i hope you will support that is congressman patrick murphy to send him to the united states senate i think youll be pleased because hes an independent voice hes a problemsolver he believes in comprehensive immigration reform he has stood with planned parenthood against the attacks that it has suffered hes even brought democrats and republicans together to try to protect our environment and fund everglades restoration he will stand up to the gun lobby and advocate for common sense gun safety measures hell defend social security and medicare not cutting or privatizing those two essential programs so please do your best to make sure we send patrick murphy to the senate now i got to ask you did anybody see the last debate  you know i have now stood next to donald trump for fouranda half hours proving conclusively that i have the stamina to do the job  and every time he says one of those outrageous things that he does have a  yes wrong  he does have a way of saying i just keep remembering michelle obamas words when he goes low we go high  but ive got to say he said something in the last debate weve never heard from anybody running for president he basically said that hes not sure  he refused to say that he would respect the results of the election now this is a guy that said the emmys were rigged so you cant really take what he says you know very seriously but this is a problem because the first thing a president does at noon on january th is to take an oath to preserve protect and defend the constitution and if you are casting doubts you want to keep people in suspense as to whether you will respect the outcome of an election that is contrary to who we are as americans we have our elections weve had them from george washington forward and were going to keep having them and show what a democracy looks like to the rest of the world  i believe strongly that the american people are going to reject this dark divisive vision of america and its happening my friends we have reached a milestone more than  million americans are registered to vote thats the biggest number ever and that number includes  million young people  and you know what else more than  million people have already voted including  million right here in florida  im hearing some great stories from people let me just tell you one its about stephen  from saint augustine hes been fighting a rare form of leukemia and heart disease hes been in and out of the hospital a dozen times in the last two years but he knows how important his vote is so i heard yesterday he ditched his oxygen tank which i would not have recommended   clung to his walker stood in line so he could cast his vote for a better america and  if stephen  can do that nobody has any excuses and i think this extends not just to democrats but to republicans and independents and i am proud to have support from republicans and independents here across florida and across america   who agree with me that we should reject hate and division we have seen donald trump insult nearly every person in america and i just  i just find that so intolerable because look at this diverse crowd look at tampa its a cosmopolitan city  florida  florida is paving the way for what our country will look like and we need to be lifting each other up listening to each other respecting each other not sewing seeds of hatred and bigotry and i think one of my biggest jobs after this election will be bringing our country together and im gonna need your help  were going to get the economy working for everybody not just people at the top with new jobs and infrastructure that  that rail that system bob  that you want were going to get it because it would help you so much  think of the people wed put to work technology innovation research advanced manufacturing and yes small business i want to be the best small business president you can have to help people start and grow their businesses  but were also going to make america the clean energy super power of the st century  i know we can create millions of jobs and we can protect florida especially coastal florida and we could protect our planet at the same time you know youre already seeing the results of climate change here in florida you know i was just in miami and they actually have flooding on sunny days with no rain people are calling  because they think a water main broke but its the oceans rising so i know there is no state that could benefit more from a clean energy agenda than florida and thats exactly what were gonna do  were also gonna make public colleges and universities tuition free  if your family makes less than  which is most families in america youre not gonna have to pay a penny to go to a public college or university  if your family makes more than that youre not gonna have to go into debt pay what you can afford and then were going to make sure you can go without getting a big debt because that drags people down  and for people who already have debt we are going to help you refinance it and pay it off  and i wanna say something to all of the teachers and educators i want to work with you and be a good partner with you and i think there should be more than one way more than just a fouryear college degree to get a good job with a good middle classlife for you and your family  so lets invest in more technical education in high school and our community colleges lets have more apprenticeship programs labor and business together  but while we grow the economy lets make it fairer we need to raise the national minimum wage so that people who work fulltime arent left in poverty  you know i gotta tell you i was raised to believe in hard work my grandfather was a factory worker my dad had a small business and we really believed you gotta work for what you get in life right but if youre working you shouldnt be at the point where you cannot even afford food or clothes or rent at the end of the year  and isnt it finally time to guarantee equal pay for womens work  you know this is not just a womens issue this is a family issue if youve got a mother a wife a sister or a daughter working its your issue  and unlike my opponent were going to ask the wealthy the millionaires and billionaires to pay their fair share because were going to close the loopholes and make sure no multimillionaire ever pays a lower tax rate than a nurse or a teacher or a police officer or a fire fighter  and i will not raise taxes on anyone making less than  a year  so when you go to the polls vote to grow the economy more jobs with  rising income vote to make the economy fairer and compare that with what my opponent has proposed he really believes if you give trillions  thats trillions with a t  trillions in tax cuts to the wealthy millionaires billionaires big corporations everything will trickle down now we know that doesnt work weve seen it and its pretty rich coming from a guy who claims to be so rich who hasnt paid a dime in federal incomes in  years  he says not paying taxes makes him smart well i dont know  i dont know how smart you have to be to lose a billion dollars in one year  and besides what kind of genius loses money running a casino for heavens sake    actually it sounds like a few people have been at  casinos here  but you know this means hes contributed zero ok he actually has a gall to call our military a disaster not only is he wrong but what right does he have to say that he hasnt contributed a penny to our military not a penny to our veterans not a penny to healthcare or education not a penny to highways or infrastructure this is  this is a false  false charge that he makes about all the problems in our country and ill tell you something we did a little research hes been denigrating america for decades this didnt start with his birther lie against president obama it didnt even start running against me back in  he took out a  ad in the new york times criticizing president regan he said our leaders were the laughing stock of the world so this is a guy who criticizes everybody but himself and at some point youve got to say wait a minute were better than that we are stronger than that we want to move forward forward into the future with confidence and optimism and thats what were offering in this campaign ive got to tell you it is not just what were against that should motivate you to go to the polls its what we are for  and i believe strongly that what were for will make it possible for all of us and especially our kids and our grandkids to have the best future americas best days can still be ahead of us but we cant make any of this happen if we dont have you voting now donald trump says he can still win and hes right thats why its so important everyone gets out and votes and here in florida  you know in a lot of places you can only vote on election day but here in florida voting couldnt be easier early voting began on monday in south florida it goes through sunday november  around the state you can go to any early voting site between  am and  pm in fact the county center on east kennedy boulevard is just a  minute walk from here  you can go vote right after this event and well have staff ready to help you get there and you can go to iwillvotecom to confirm your polling place and make a plan to vote but i also hope you will volunteer these last two weeks  were reaching out to everybody so go to hillaryclintoncom and sign up to volunteer take out your phone and text join  and that is  we can use you were making millions of phone calls in florida were knocking on  maybe by the time we finish  millions of doors we dont want anybody to be left out or left behind because on january th america will have a new president  now ive got to say say   so ive got to say to you that you know change is inevitable in life right and so the real question is what kind of change are we going to have and i want you to talk to anybody you know whos either thinking of not voting or maybe thinking of voting for my opponent  no im serious im serious you know after this election if im fortunate enough to be elected we are going to reach out to everybody right and ask the people youre talking to what kind of change they really want because i dont think most americans want the kind of divisive and dark change donald trump is offering mass deportations that will rip families apart a repeal of gunfree school zones on day one going back to the day when insurance companies could discriminate against us if we have a preexisting condition letting wall street write its own rules denying the science of climate change rolling back marriage equality defunding planned parenthood   the hugest tax breaks ever for the wealthy and a broad abandoning our alliances and allowing more countries to get nuclear weapons now that may be change but boy thats not the change we need and my vision is different its more hopeful optimistic and unifying i want us to be a country where every student can afford to go to college if thats what you choose i want us to be a country where millions of people are working in good highpaying jobs and in new industries like clean energy and advanced manufacturing i want us to be a country where hardworking immigrants who pay taxes  and by the way onehalf of undocumented workers pay federal income taxes which means they are paying more federal income taxes than donald trump pays  and a country where we not only have equal pay for our work but affordable childcare where were respected in the world working with our allies to defeat terrorism and stop the spread of nuclear weapons so yes change is coming the choice is yours about what kind of change well have and i hope you will choose to be part of this campaign because its not just about winning on november th as important as that is it is about getting to work because i do believe we are stronger together tim kaine and i wrote a book laying out our agenda because i think you deserve to know what i will try to do as your president so if you will help we will come together to give every american the chance to chart your own future and contribute to our great country lets prove once and for all that love trumps hate thank you"
22,"Clinton","wow thank you so much and hello kent state  and happy halloween everybody it is great to be back in ohio even if the world series is making life very stressful for cubs fans everywhere  i want to thank bruce blair for that introduction and for his service to our nation i think every american should hear his story over the next eight days before they vote i also want to thank everyone who was part of the preprogram in particular let me thank senator sherrod brown such a great senator  my dear friend and great congressman tim ryan  state representative john boccieri  state representative kathleen clyde  and let me thank kent clark the acapella group that sang during the preprogram  my friends we are about to enter the final week of this election so i wanted to come back to ohio one of the most competitive and consequential battleground states in the country to talk about whats at stake in this election but let me start with this im sure a lot of you may be asking what this new email story is about and why in the world the fbi would decide to jump into an election with no evidence of any wrongdoing with just days to go  thats a good question and first of all for those of you who are concerned about my using personal email i understand and as ive said im not making excuses ive said it was a mistake and i regret it and now they apparently want to look at emails of one of my staffers and by all means they should look at them and i am sure they will reach the same conclusion they did when they looked at my emails for the last year there is no case here  and they said it wasnt even a close call and i think most people have decided a long time ago what they think about all of this now what people are focused on is choosing the next president and commander in chief of the united states of america  and did any of you see the debates  well i think it was important because i had a chance to talk about my  years of public service and my plans for our country and then people could weigh that against what my opponent has done and said i am running against a man who says he doesnt understand why we cant use nuclear weapons he actually said then why are we making them and he wants more countries to have nuclear weapons japan south korea even saudi arabia imagine imagine nuclear weapons smack in the middle of the middle east and if youre telling yourself hell surround himself with smart people who will stop these crazy ideas remember this when he was asked who he consults on foreign policy donald trump said he didnt need to consult because and i quote i have a very good brain  he says he knows more about isis than our generals do no he does not  and of course the people donald trump has around him include two men whose activities are reportedly being investigated for their ties to russia vladimir putin and putins allies so in these last days lets not get distracted from the real choice in this election and the consequences for your future  i started saying last june i believe that donald trump has proven himself to be temperamentally unfit and totally unqualified to be president and commander in chief  and ive got to tell you i did not take any pleasure in saying that i have known i have known for years now people who ran for president republicans and democrats and i have my differences with republicans and even with democrats but i never doubted their fitness to serve donald trump is different thats as serious as it gets so today i want to talk about national security because when the election is over and people wake up on november th we will have picked the person who will carry the responsibility for all of these weighty decisions and that should really convince anyone how high the stakes are in this election i just want to focus on three of the most crucial questions facing the next president can you be trusted to command our nuclear arsenal and make literally lifeanddeath decisions about war and peace how do you handle a crisis and do you know the difference between our allies and our adversaries  well start with nuclear weapons now i know there are some who will say that any discussion of this topic could be fearmongering but i dont think so and in part because of what you just heard from bruce blair when dozens of retired nuclear launch officers publicly state that donald trump should and i quote not have his finger on the button then this is a topic that cant be avoided and as ive said donald has repeatedly suggested more countries should have nuclear weapons he must not realize or care that the more nuclear material there is in the world the more likely terrorists are to get their hands on it or that someone will miscalculate and start a war that cant be stopped and when a few more countries go nuclear their neighbors will feel pressure to do so as well one of the reasons i worked so hard to impose sanctions on iran so that we could get them to the negotiating table was so we would not have a nuclear arms race in the middle east and i am proud that we put a lid on irans nuclear weapons program  but even the prospect of an actual nuclear war doesnt seem to bother donald trump good luck enjoy yourselves folks was what he had to say about a potential nuclear conflict in asia i wonder if he knows that a single nuclear warhead can kill millions of people these are weapons today far more powerful than the bombs that destroyed hiroshima and nagasaki during world war ii to talk so casually so cavalierly about mass annihilation is truly appalling president ronald reagan once said and he worked hard for arms control and i admired what he did working with the soviet union and he once said he feared and this is a quote from president reagan some fool or some maniac or some accident triggering the kind of war that is the end of the line for all of us that has been the fear and the commitment of democratic and republican presidents since the dawn of the atomic age so what would he think about donald trump who says he wants to be and quote unpredictable about using the most powerful weapons ever produced and heres the thing with nuclear weapons as bruce told you when the president gives the order thats it theres no veto for congress no veto by the joint chiefs the officers in the silos have no choice but to fire and that can take as little as four minutes thats why all those retired launch officers stepped forward and said donald trump should never be put in charge of our nuclear arsenal and when you heard from bruce blair his story is worth remembering in  bruce was a young military officer working in an underground bunker in montana his job was to launch as many as  nuclear weapons if the president ever gave the order then one night in october as the united states and the soviet union squared off over an escalating conflict in the middle east the emergency message he had trained for arrived prepare for nuclear war like other american officers in bunkers and submarines and bombers around the world bruce and his colleagues started the process because that was their duty they unlocked the safe they took out the launch codes and the keys and then strapped into their chairs to brace for the shockwaves that would come if a russian warhead detonated above them then they waited for the final order from the president thankfully it never came but when bruce looks at donald trump he sees his hairtrigger temper and he thinks about what it felt like inside that bunker that night as ive said many times a man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons  and that brings me to the second question i think voters should ask about both candidates how do you handle a crisis weve seen in this campaign that donald trump loses his cool at the slightest provocation when hes gotten a tough question from a reporter when hes challenged in a debate when he sees a protester at a rally when hes confronted with his own words so imagine him in the oval office facing a real crisis imagine his advisers afraid to tell him what he doesnt want to hear racing against his legendarily short attention span   to lay out lifeanddeath choices too complex to be reduced to a single tweet  and then imagine him plunging us into a war because somebody got under his very thin skin now thankfully hes never been in a position where he had to help make lifeanddeath decisions for our country but there was one national crisis where we did get a good look at how donald trump handles himself donald is a new yorker and his finest moment in this campaign was when he defended new york against ted cruzs attacks in a debate and he invoked the days after  when new yorkers really came together to take care of each other i couldnt agree more thats why it was so upsetting to learn what donald was actually doing on  after the world watched with horror as the twin towers fell he called in to a new york tv station and even on that horrible day when thousands of people lost their lives he couldnt stop himself from pointing out that now because the towers had fallen a building he owned was the tallest in lower manhattan what kind of person brags at a moment like that ill tell you someone who should never set foot in the oval office and serve as commander in chief  you know for me i take this very personally my friends because i was one of new yorks senators along with chuck schumer on  he and i were on the ground the very next day meeting with the governor the mayor emergency officials and i will never forget the site of ground zero the thick smoke made it hard to breathe or see some of the firefighters and other first responders we met had been on duty nonstop since the planes hit the towers they had all lost friends in a makeshift command center we were briefed on the damage and it was clear we were going to need a lot of help to recover new york and we were going to have to really make it our absolute mission to not only rebuild new york but to keep america safe thats what i did for eight years as a senator i never stopped fighting to keep our country safer and to ensure that first responders got the medical care they needed  and i think its important to reflect on what each of us has done in moments like that because a lot of the crises that come at a president are not predicted they happen ill tell you a quick story it was after presidentelect obama asked me to be secretary of state but before the inauguration and i got a call to come to an emergency meeting in the white house in the situation room and the new obama national security team was on one side of the table and the outgoing bush national security team was on the other side and the bush administration had gotten credible intelligence that there was going to be an attack at our inauguration so even before we were swornin to do our jobs we were faced with helping to make such a consequential decision it really matters what your experience has been what your values are whether you can be counted on to make that decision you learn a lot about people in moments like that and as i sat there with the pressure on having to think through in my own head how we evaluated this intelligence how we did everything we could to preserve our inauguration of our first africanamerican president on the mall in washington   we made the decision to go forward obviously some of you might have been there but we also did everything we could to double our efforts to find out about the intelligence and to secure the hundreds of thousands of people who would be there so you have to ask yourself in a crisis who would you trust who will listen to good advice keep a level head and make the right call because thats the person you want as our president and commander in chief  now lets get to the third question for all of the voters to consider about each of us do you know the difference between our allies and our adversaries now this may seem like an easy question if you got it on an exam i think youd be able to answer it  but apparently its hard for donald he has picked fights with our friends i mean the president of mexico the british prime minister the german chancellor pretty much the entire nation of japan  and he even picked a fight with the pope  and at the same time he is praising tyrants and dictators like saddam hussein and kim jongun in north korea and bashar alassad for their supposed strong leadership he even praised the chinese government for massacring protesters in tienanmen square  trump has repeatedly suggested he would abandon our allies in europe and asia hes called nato quote obsolete obsolete nato is the greatest military alliance in the history of the world and its based on something  its based on something called article five which says an attack on one is an attack on all and article five has only been invoked one time when our allies came to our defense after  we still have nato allies fighting sidebyside working sidebyside with american troops in afghanistan they joined us in going after al qaida and bin laden now were supposed to tell them we wont have their back and by the way right now our nato allies are helping identify and track terrorists who threaten america and europe theyre hosting radar and missile defense installations that protect us against potential threats from iran and elsewhere and as our nato forces in afghanistan stand shouldertoshoulder with american troops they share the risks and burdens now theyre moving into the baltic states to deter russian aggression treating our allies like the small businesses and contractors that trump exploited and stiffed in atlantic city hanging them out dry would make our country and our world less safe  and it would also play right into the hands of russia and china which are envious of our alliances and eager to see them weaken and fail but maybe thats the point because whats most striking about all of this and i would argue most important for voters to consider is the relationship between donald trump and russian president vladimir putin as former secretary madeline albright put it and i quote here we have never seen a mind meld of the kind between the russian leadership and a candidate for the presidency of the united states michael morell who ran the cia and grew up just a few miles from here has said that putin is manipulating donald putin is a trained intelligence officer from the old kgb he knows he can use flattery to get into donalds head to make donald the kremlins puppet and it seems to be working donald has signaled to putin that he will let russia do whatever it wants from ukraine to syria and beyond hes even said putin is a stronger leader than president obama   and it gets worse the us intelligence community has now confirmed that the russian government which means putin is directing cyberattacks against targets in the united states to influence the outcome of our election so ask yourself why would putin be trying to get donald trump elected president could it be because of all the nice things donald has said about him or the fact that he has promised to adopt pro kremlin policies or maybe because of the extensive business dealings with russian oligarchs with ties to putin now since donald wont release his tax returns and dont hold your breath   we dont know the full extent of his business relationships but what we know is disturbing and we know this we are dealing with something unprecedented in the history of our country a foreign adversary trying to influence our presidential election that should scare everyone democrat republican and independent and with the election just eight days away this cant wait any longer donald trump should immediately disclose all of his ties and connections to the kremlin and its associates  the american people deserve to know the full extent of these links and how they relate to what the russians are doing in our election because when you step back and take it all in its no surprise that  republican national security experts wrote an open letter saying they will not vote for donald trump because he would be in their words the most reckless president in american history and its no surprise that not a single former president secretary of state or national security adviser from either party has endorsed him  and its no surprise that bob gates bob gates who served eight presidents over  years democrats and republicans alike has said trump is and i quote beyond repair stubbornly uninformed about the world and how to lead our country and government temperamentally unsuited to lead our men and women in uniform unqualified and unfit to be commander in chief unquote  so i hope you and voters across ohio and america will think about all of these national security issues when you cast your vote in this election think about what it takes to lead and how we want to secure the safety of our country our children and our grandchildren and whos best prepared to do that because make no mistake that really is whats on the ballot this year its not just my name and donald trumps name its our future our security our values its who we are as a country donald trump has a dark and divisive vision for america that could tear our country apart but the good news is theres another vision for america instead of dark and divisive its hopeful and inclusive and optimistic and unifying  and it is bighearted not smallminded it is about lifting people up not tearing each other down  it is a vision that says as i believe in my heart a vision that says we are stronger together millions of people across our country are standing up and saying we believe in america that is great because it is good thats democrats republicans independents because we believe in an america where women are respected   an america where veterans are honored parents are supported workers are paid fairly   an america where marriage is a right and discrimination is wrong   an america that leads in the world and lives up to our values where everyone counts everyone has a place where the american dream is big enough for everyone this goes way beyond politics and partisanship were really talking about what it means to be an american in the st century about the basic lessons we want to teach boys and girls our kids and grandkids it turns out if you dig deep enough through all the mud of politics eventually you hit something hard and true a foundation of fundamental values that unite us as americans   basic beliefs about equality and opportunity and freedom and common decency that is something to defend and build on and in the end that is what this election is all about and here in ohio you can make the difference early voting has already begun so now is the time  every phone call you make every door you knock on moves us forward you can go to hillaryclintoncom and volunteer you can text join to  to do the same you know sometimes if youve studied history you know the fate of the greatest nations comes down to single moments in time this is one of those makeorbreak moments for the united states  and it truly is in your hands as it should be so when your kids and grandkids ask what you did in  when everything was on the line i hope youll be able to say i voted for a better stronger fairer america a place where our future will be created and charted by people who have confidence that the best days of america are still ahead of us particularly young people who i believe absolutely should help make that future  so lets come together let us make clear that were going to stand up for an america that we believe in because that america believes in us and were going to prove once and for all that love trumps hate thank you"
23,"Clinton","thank you   thank you so much wow it is great to be back in cincinnati  what a beautiful night on the banks of this magnificent river i am grateful to all of you i am thrilled to be here with my dear friends mark and gabby and with all of you because there are just eight days left in what is the most important election of our lifetimes  are you ready to work hard in this election and win it  are you ready to send ted strickland to the united states senate  you know ive known ted a long time he is a champion for workers and families he knows that ohio needs more good jobs with rising wages and he is the kind of person who will actually work to get things done breaking through the gridlock in washington  and this is important unlike his opponent ted strickland has never been afraid to stand up to donald trump  i also want to thank mayor john cranley and state representative alicia reece and all the other elected officials including my friend the secretary of state alison lundergan grimes from across the river in kentucky  and we are so fortunate to have two other champions for american families with us today i am awed by the courage and commitment that both mark and gabby bring to their work to do everything they can to help save lives in america  you know as gabby says everyday when she goes out fight fight fight and fight she does she fights to make sure that we save lives and we prevent injuries and we do it together to end the epidemic of gun violence that threatens our children our fellow men and women our country  and gabby and mark know something very important there is a big majority of americans  including a majority of gun owners  to stand behind and achieve common sense gun safety measures and   i am looking forward to working with them as their partner you know you go through life you go through the campaigns theres ups and therere downs and you know my mother who had a really difficult life she told me something that has stayed with me and certainly has come in handy in this campaign everybody gets knocked down what matters is whether you get back up  and throughout this campaign i have stayed focused on one thing you your lives your families the problems that keep you up at night because thats really what this election is all about its not about the noise and the distractions its about what kind of country we want for our kids and what kind of president can help get us there i  i  you know i  i have so much that i want to do with you on behalf of cincinnati and ohio and america and whether or not i get the chance to serve you really depends on what happens in this election  now earlier  earlier today  earlier today i was up at kent state  a great university  and i told them about some of the reasons why i think its really important to get everybody out to vote in this election but i started by saying you know theres this new email story about you know why in the world the fbi   would decide to jump into an election without evidence of any wrong doing with just days to go thats a really good question but i want you to know look ive said repeatedly on  i  you know i made a mistake im not making any excuses but i will tell you this if they want to look at some more emails of one of my staffers by all means go ahead look at them and i know they will reach the same conclusion they reached when they looked at my emails last year right  it wasnt even a close call and i think most people have moved on theyre looking and focused on ok who is going to be the next president and commanderinchief  did any of you see  did any of you see the debates any of you see the debates   i  i got a little bit of a chance you know i did stand there for fourandahalf hours with donald trump proving conclusively i have the stamina to do the job  but  but i did occasionally get the chance to you know ask people to take a look at my  years of public service my plans for our country what tim kaine and i have said we want to do and then weigh that against my opponent what hes done and said i  i am running against someone who says he doesnt understand why we cant use nuclear weapons he actually said then why are we making them he wants more countries to have nuclear weapons hes mentioned japan south korea even saudi arabia now if you are hoping that he might surround himself with good people who would stop his crazy ideas remember this when he was asked who he consults with on foreign policy donald trump said he didnt need to consult because and i quote i have a very good brain  he said he knows more about isis than our generals do  no donald you dont and of course the people that donald trump has around him include two men whos activities are also reportedly being investigated because of their ties to russia vladimir putin and their allies so in these last days lets not get distracted from the real choice in this election donald trump has proven himself to be temperamentally unfit and totally unqualified to be president and commanderinchief  i have to tell you that  it does not give me any pleasure saying that its not a small thing i  i have watched and known a lot of the people who have run for president both republicans and democrats and look ive had my disagreements with republicans i might have disagreed on policies or principles but i never doubted their fitness to serve in this office donald trump is different and thats why there is so much at stake in this election he has a dark and divisive vision for america that could tear our country apart abraham lincoln understood a house divided against itself cannot stand and that was over the greatest of challenges the challenge posed by slavery and we fought a civil war but we also have to take stock of how divided we are today the kinds of divisions that need to be healed to bring people together i will tell you this i want to bring not just democrats but republicans and independents people who will vote for me and people who vote against me together  because i have a very different vision of america instead of dark and divisive its hopeful and inclusive its big hearted not small minded  it is about lifting people up not putting them down its a vision that says and i believe this with all my heart we are stronger together and   america is great because america is good never forget that yes we have our flaws of course were only humans but what we have done over the course of our history to keep widening the circle of opportunity and equality and freedom is unlike any other place in the history of the world so we want an america where women are respected   where our veterans are honored   where parents and families are supported and workers are paid fairly and we believe in an america where marriage is a right and discrimination is wrong   an america that leads in the world and lives up to our values where everyone counts everyone has a place and the american dream is big enough for everybody so the choice could not be clearer and the stakes could not be higher when i was at kent state talking about the threats that donald trump poses to our national security i was really struck it was a very big crowd and it was primarily students and you know i thought to myself well im not going to give a rahrah speech because i really want to talk about what this means to national security and i was introduced by a gentleman named bruce blair a former air force officer in charge of the nuclear codes and keys a launch officer and he came out for me along with more than  launch officers and basically they said we cannot support donald trump because he should never ever be near the nuclear codes and keys  and even the prospect of an actual nuclear war doesnt seem to bother him good luck enjoy yourselves folks is what he had to stay about a potential nuclear conflict in asia i wonder if he even knows that a single  a single nuclear warhead can kill millions of people you know that is why dozens of retired nuclear launch officers took the unprecedented step in saying that donald trump should and i quote not have his finger on the button and when it comes to handling a crisis weve seen in this campaign that donald trump loses his cool at the slightest provocation when hes gotten a tough question from a reporter or when hes challenged in a debate or when he sees a protester at a rally when hes confronted by his own words so imagine him in the oval office facing a real crisis  imagine him plunging us into a war because somebody got under his very thin skin i hope youll think about that when you cast your vote in this election think about what it takes to lead in a very complicated world and in whos hands you want to put the safety of our children and grandchildren and think about the difference between electing a president who will do nothing and a president who will tackle the epidemic of gun violence in america  you know as gabby knows so well  americans a year are killed by guns thousands more are injured its an average of  people a day dying here in ohio more people are killed by guns than die in car crashes we have seen moviegoers gunned down in theaters little children killed in their classrooms clubgoers massacred in orlando nine faithful people murdered at bible study in charleston south carolina and weve seen far too many young africanamerican men and women killed by gun violence which is now the leading cause of death for young black men  and when we think about that we think of dontre hamilton or jordan davis or trayvon martin and others ive had the great honor of getting to know their mothers who have turned their grief into action and their mourning into a movement but heres what i want to say if anything else in our country were killing as many people people of good faith people who believe like we do in the nd amendment people who own guns people who go hunting people who are collectors we would say hey wait a minute this cant go on we need comprehensive background checks to close the gun show loop hole close the online loop hole  and we know here in ohio a majority of gun owners support these common sense steps to prevent gun violence because they know we can respect the nd amendment and keep our kids and communities safe at the same time and we need to keep guns out of the hands of suspected terrorists if you are too dangerous to fly you are too dangerous to buy a gun period  and look there is  there is a very clear difference donald trump wont stand up to the gun lobby hes sold out to them in fact the gun lobby is spending more on ads to get donald trump elected than any other group more than  million in ohio alone and in return donald trump has promised to repeal president obamas actions to strengthen criminal background checks donald says guns should be allowed in nightclubs that serve alcohol hes even said on his very first day in office he would require every school in america to let people carry guns into our classrooms  how can anyone think our schools will be safer with more guns so i have stood up to the gun lobby for years  which is why they are running all these ads against me  and i will stand up to them as president  i will work with gabby and mark and americans for responsible solutions to pass common sense reforms because weve got to keep guns out of the wrong hands and help save lives i will also get up everyday in the white house working my heart out for you whatever i can do to knock down barriers to empower people to get the economy working for everybody not just those at the top thats how i was raised i was raised to believe that if you work hard  and i believe in hard work  you should be able to get ahead and stay ahead in america  and i will never ever quit on you when i tell you im going to try to do something that will make a positive difference in your life i dont care what the political or other barriers are were going to find a way over under around or through until we get it done  ive been fighting for families and underdogs my entire life and im not stopping now  so just remember when our opponents go low we go high  were not going to be distracted were not going to be knocked off course we know how much this election matters and everything all of you can do between now and the time that the polls close is going to really count now the donald trump campaign strategy is pretty simple theyve announced it their strategy is get women to stay home get young people to stay home and get people of color to stay home  its all part of his scorched earth campaign but actually adds up to more than half of our whole population when you stop to think about it and it goes against everything we stand for so if youre as upset as i am by the campaign that he has run the things he has said insulting not just women but immigrants latinos african americans prisoners of war muslims veterans the military i mean the list goes on and on its almost impossible to understand how somebody could run for president who seems not to like america as much as he does  so you know the best way to stop him by showing up with the biggest turnout in history  we need more americans to vote and i think we have a chance to get more americans from all walks of life to vote because were already seeing record turnout  million people have already voted in this election and more than  million of them are right here in ohio  there is no doubt if we vote we win so   please if you havent voted early please do so and please get your friends and your family everybody you know to vote take people to vote with you try to help those who might have a little problem getting there make sure that everybody you know understands early voting has begun and you can go to iwillvotecom to find your nearest early voting location because make no mistake whatever issue you care about  ive only mentioned a few tonight  but whatever issue you care about is on the ballot now maybe my name and my opponents name but where we stand on these issues what weve done in the past what we have said we want to do in the future that is all on the ballot the future of our economy is at stake of our education system is at stake fighting climate change and clean renewable energy jobs are at stake  lgbt equality is at stake  equal pay for women is at stake  actually in the end the american dream itself is at stake so i want you to think about how youll feel on november th happy  i think thats the right answer  but just suppose  just suppose you go to bed early  suppose you go to bed early maybe you were too busy to vote or maybe you didnt make calls or knocked on doors i want you to imagine so you get up early on the morning of the th and you log on to news to find out hey whats going on or maybe you turn on the tv or the radio and you hear  i want you to really understand what that means for you and for all of us because i prefer for us to be motivated by what were for not what were against  but i also think its prudent to imagine what could happen if we dont do our part and when in the future somebody asks you maybe your kids or your grandkids what did you do when everything was on the line i want you to be able to say i voted for a better fairer stronger america  lets go out and in these next eight days do everything we can to make it clear were going after the kind of future that includes everybody were going to build this economy new jobs rising rages were going to make college affordable and help you pay down your student debt we are going to do what will give you the best chance for your own lives and the lives of our kids and our grandkids so if we build that future together we will be able to say we were part of making sure that americas best days are still ahead of us  and we will prove once and for all that love trumps hate thank you all"
24,"Clinton","hello dade city  wow  i am so excited about being here thank you all for this really warm wonderful welcome  and i  i think on behalf of all of us i wanna thank alisha machado for that introduction and for sharing  sharing her story with us alisha will be voting for the very first time in this election  and i am very grateful for her support im also delighted that were joined today by your great senator bill nelson and his wife grace  i also wanna thank representative amanda hickman from the florida state house michael cox  chairman of the greater pasco  chamber of commerce michael ledbetter  who is the pasco  county democratic executive committee chair and his wife beverly  and thanks to retired colonel wilson elkton for his pledge of allegiance and thanks to all the elected officials here  and i especially wanna thank all of you for not just joining us but helping us to get out the vote in this last week  its almost hard to believe isnt it there are only seven days left in this election  so are you ready to vote  are you ready to volunteer these last seven days  i hope too that you are ready to elect patrick murphy to the united states senate  patrick whose been in congress will be an independent voice for florida families and i am so excited to think about what he could do because unlike his opponent hes never been afraid to stand up to donald trump  now somebody asked me the other day why do you keep coming back to florida just look around folks i mean  it is  its a beautiful place and i have lots of friends but its also really important in this election florida can decide who our next president is which will affect the nation and the world  and i want to make sure that every voter in florida spends these next seven days thinking about whats at stake in this election because honestly i believe this may be the most important election of our lifetimes  one week from today we will be choosing or next president and commanderinchief of the united states  i dont  i dont think the choice could be any clearer you know i have spent my career fighting for children and families i have served in the united states senate served on the senate armed services committee i was in the situation room when we bought osama bin laden to justice  i represented you as your secretary of state going to  countries negotiating with friend and foe alike i am ready to serve if you give me the great honor of being your president    now i do have to say that i think that stands in contrast to my opponent and you know maybe for you if you think about all of the issues that separate donald trump from me it could be his dangerous statements about nuclear weapons when a journalist told donald trump that people were worried about how causally he talks about nuclear weapons he said well then why are we making them  and i have to tell you yesterday i was in ohio and i was introduced by a gentleman who was one our officers in charge of watching nuclear weapons if the order ever came from our president and what he told the crowd it was a big crowd at kent state university i think every voter should hear basically his name was bruce blair he said that having had the responsibility of sitting in a bunker being responsible for the codes and the keys to our nuclear weapons he knows that when a president makes the order to launch a nuclear attack there is no appeal there is no veto and that is why he has joined with dozens of former air force officers to send a letter to say we need a president with the temperament the steadiness the calmness to be in charge of nuclear weapons and therefore they cannot support donald trump because he does not have the temperament to be our commander in chief and handle those responsibilities  so when you think about voting  early voting this week voting next tuesday  responsibility for our nuclear weapons is on the ballot so is immigration do we want to round up millions of people who are here working  raising their families as he has suggested he will do i dont think so i think what we want is to bring them out of the shadows so that they cant be exploited by employers  by employers like donald trump who refuse to hire americans and hired undocumented workers so he could pay them less i dont think thats right  now maybe for some of you what donald trump said about prisoners of war will be enough reason to vote against him somebody wholl question the patriotism and the service of john mccain because he was a prisoner of war we need a commander in chief who respects the service and sacrifice of the men and women who wear our uniform  or maybe for some of you its what he said about a judge born in indiana who just happened to be assigned the case brought by people who were defrauded by the phony trump university and so trump said well we cant trust him because his parents were born in mexico  now paul ryan the republican speaker of the house called  well but wait a minute he called what trump said about that distinguished federal judge the definition of a racist comment  and then trump went on to attack a gold start family whose son capitan kahn died defending our country simply because that family was muslim  and then lets not forget trump spent years  years insisting that president obama was not born in the united states even after the birth certificate was produced  honestly if this were something new i  i think wed all be asking ourselves well what  what does he have against president obama or what does he have against me but this is not new i know im reaching out to republicans and independents as well as democrats because i want to be the president for all americans  and heres what i want you tell  i want you to tell your republican friends in  donald trump took out a  ad in the new york times to criticize president reagan he said our leaders are the laughing stock of the world so this is a man who thinks that he is better than president reagan better than president obama literally better than anybody i guess and when you think about it what he said at the convention i alone can fix it runs counter to who we are as americans we work together so there are many reasons why i think it is fair to conclude that donald trump is unqualified and unfit to be president but today i want to just spend a few minutes focusing in particular about what he has said and what he has done to women and girls because   you know any of you see the debates   you know i stood next to donald for four and half hours for those three debates proving conclusively i have the stamina to be president of the united states and during those debates you know donald always used to say what have you been doing for  years and i always found that kind of odd because he could google it and find out and so you know ive been a lawyer ive been a first lady and ive been a senator and ive been secretary of state  ive been a wife and a mother and a grandmother and a friend and a churchgoer and for my entire life ive been a woman and when i think about what we now know about donald trump and what hes been doing for  years he sure has spent a lot of time demeaning degrading insulting and assaulting women and i got to tell you some of what weve learned  some of this stuff is very upsetting   i would frankly rather be here talking about nearly anything else like how were going to create more good jobs and get the economy working for everybody not just those at the top how were going to make college affordable for every single family  because i have a plan that if your family makes less than  you will not pay tuition to go to a state college or university  and if youre above that it will be debt free and we help you pay back the debt you already have so you can get out from under it  but i cant just talk about all the good things we want to do because people are making up their minds this is a consequential choice so weve got to talk about something that frankly is painful   because it matters we cant just wish it away and you know a lot of his supporters dont like to hear this i dont blame them if i was supporting him i wouldnt want to hear it either to be honest but i got to tell you i learned way back in elementary school and i learned it in sunday school you know its not ok to insult people its not ok   and look at what he does he calls women ugly disgusting nasty all the time  he calls women pigs rates bodies on a scale from one to ten we just heard from alicia she was miss universe when donald trump owned the pageant well he said she put on some weight and it made him angry so he called her miss piggy called her miss housekeeping because shes a beautiful latina  he brought a bunch of reporters to a gym to watch him order her around to exercise  now you know he also said this is somebody who likes to eat well i have to say who doesnt like to eat  i mean really can we just stop for a minute and reflect on the absurdity of donald trump finding fault with miss universe  but youve got to ask why does he do these things who acts like this and ill tell you who a bully thats who  and thankfully alicia refuses to let such a small person get her down she knows that donald trump  donald trump doesnt get to decide her value in her eyes and in the eyes of her family and her friends  but what about our girls   what about girls watching all this what happens to their confidence their sense of self worth if youve got a daughter a granddaughter a sister a mother a wife a good friend someone like this becoming president who insults more than half the population of the united states of america and what about our boys   this is not someone we  we want them looking up to   you know not so long ago i was the mother of a teenage girl and you know every day i tried to make sure she knew that she was smart and she was capable and im doing the same thing with my granddaughter and my grandson    because lets be honest here the world has a way of telling our girls exactly the opposite they dont look right theyre not thin enough they dont act right no one will like then unless they change their clothes or straighten their hair or stop being bossy or whatever the criticism might be right and i remember when chelsea was a teenager i would wait on the second floor of the white house in the long hall thats there for her to come home from school and sometimes we only had a few minutes together but before shed run off to talk to her friends or do whatever she was planning to i would figure out kind of how were the  how was the day you know wed talk about what was on her mind and that time together was really valuable to me as a parent   because we parents  and i know there are a lot of parents here today we work hard to give our kids a sense of confidence to send them out into the world believing in their own value   and it really is important that we dont let anybody take that away from them   and we want them to be strong we dont want them to feel bad about themselves   and weve got to work hard to make sure our boys just like our girls have that same sense of positive energy not negative not tearing people down   lifting people up and respecting women in fact all of us should respect each other in our country and  so when  i look at my granddaughter and my grandson i am on the same mission i want them to know theyre loved theyre cared for theyre respected i want them to develop a good work ethic i believe in hard work and i want them to go out and prove themselves in the world but thats what i want for every child   i have spent my life doing everything i could to help kids and families it will be the mission of my presidency i will get up everyday in the white house trying to figure out how can we knock down the barriers overcome the challenges so that people living here in pasco ph county can get ahead and stay ahead applause so i know theres work to be done we cant do it with just words alone weve gotta do more to stop treatment about women being somehow objectified and oh my gosh when we heard that tape and we heard what he does to women im not gonna repeat it but you know what donald trump was bragging about grabbing women mistreating women and i have to tell you since that tape came out  women have come forward to say what he said on that tape is what he did to me and then we heard his response what he does at his rallies is to go after those women all over again insulting him he said he  he couldnt possibly have said those things because the women werent attractive enough to assault   look at her he said about one woman i dont think so about another he said she wouldnt be my first choice hes also on tape bragging with the radio personality howard stern about how he used to go backstage at his beauty pageants and he would barge in on women while they were getting dressed   he said he did that  he said he did that to inspect them that was his word and he said i sort of got away with things like that and sure enough contestants have come forward to say yes thats exactly what he did to us now as bad as that is he didnt just do it at the miss usa pageant or the miss universe pageant hes also been accused of doing this at the miss teen usa pageant   contestants say that donald trump came in to look at them when they were changing some of them were just  years old   we cannot hide from this weve got to be willing to face it this man wants to be president of the united states of america and   our wonderful first lady michelle obama spoke for many of us  when she said donald trumps words had shaken her to her core for a lot of women whove gone through something like this in your lives thats brought back painful memories and for men who would never ever talk or act like donald its been shocking to see this he tried to explain it away as locker room talk well ill tell you what a lot of professional athletes stood up and said not in our locker rooms that does not happen  but i guess the bottom line is he things belittling women makes him a bigger man and i dont think theres a women anywhere who doesnt know what that feels like he doesnt see us as full human beings with our own dreams our own purposes our own capabilities and he has shown that clearly throughout this campaign well he is very wrong he is wrong about both the women and the men of this country he has shown us who he is let us on tuesday show him who we are  we can stand up for what we believe what we want for our children and our grandchildren what we know is right and you can go down the list of everything he has said he doesnt believe in equal pay he thinks pregnancy is an inconvenience he wont the minimum wage and he said if he comes home and dinner is not on the table he gets angry  instead of supporting women whore out there supporting their families he wants to make it even harder well i have a message for him were gonna fight for affordable child care  we are gonna fight for equal pay for all people  were gonna fight for paid family leave were gonna fight to make sure everybody gets rising wages in america and thats important because so many people are still struggling still working hard raising a family having a hard time getting all of their bills paid and thats especially true for minimum wage workers who two thirds of whom are women so weve got work to do my friends im excited because i know we can do this and i will stand up and i will fight for you i will work for you i will give my heart to this mission of making our country all it should be because instead of donald trumps dangerous and divisive vision mine is positive optimistic hopeful and unifying  but i cant do any of this without your help early voting has already begun almost  million americans have already voted and that includes four million right here in florida  americans are voting for the kind of better future we can make together and voting on all the issues that they care about it may be my name and donalds name on the ballot but everything you care about  our security our economy bringing our country together the environment  clean water and clear air here in dade city you can vote everyday from now until november th from  am to  pm in fact right now the east pasco government center  just a few minutes drive away  you can go there right after this rally and vote because we need everybody to stand up in this election if youve got a mailin ballot at home send it in when you get home today dont wait to send it back talk to your friends and family and your neighbors your coworkers and you know donald trumps strategys pretty simple he says he wants to suppress young people from voting women from voting people of color from voting i mean thats a lot of people by showing up with the biggest turnout ever we will send him and everybody a message that thats not who we are  now i know here in this  this county and this larger region you probably know some people who are going to vote for trump and heres what i want to ask you i want you to talk with them ask them what they care about ask them what kind of future they want for our country because donald trumps economic plan is slashing taxes on the wealthy and big corporations i have said i want the wealthy to pay their fair share and i will not raise taxes anybody making less than  a year  so there could not be no matter what you cared about a bigger difference between me and donald trump and i hope that you will come out and volunteer for these last seven days we are signing people up for volunteer shifts making calls knocking on doors it really matters turnout matters please go to hillaryclintoncom to see how you can get involved and heres what  heres what i want to leave you with you know i feel like so many of you  that our country is great but we can make it greater and the main reason america is great is because american is good we are a big hearted generous people not a small kinded people we know that if everybody works together we will get further together than if we separate people we push them down we engage in all the negativity weve heard too much about in this campaign but sometimes the fate of even the greatest nations lies in the balance and for america this is one of these make or break elections it really is in your hands and i hope you will think about how you will feel the day after the election on november the th are we going forward together or are we going to be pulled backwards by someone who wants to bully us  and i hope i hope you will think about how together we can make a difference i want to be your partner as well as your president i want us to create the best possible future for our children and out grandchildren that is what i will work my heart out to do and i hope you will help me to make a better fairer stronger america where we prove once and for all that love trumps hate thank you all"
25,"Clinton","wow    thank you so much  and thank you for being out here on this beautiful night it is great to be back with all of you on sunday i had the great privilege of speaking to the congregation at new mount olive baptist church  and i couldnt leave town without stopping at bettys for some soul food  and its wonderful to be here with so many of my friends and people i admire i want to thank congressman alcee hastings who just really came out here and revved everybody up  i want to thank the one the only congressman john lewis an icon in the civil rights movement  my friend congresswoman debbie wasserman schultz  congressman ted deutch  and i have to tell you i am really excited and very hopeful that you will send patrick murphy to the united states senate  so let me thank all the elected officials who are here because this is a big deal there are only now seven days left in the most important election of our lifetimes we cannot take anything anybody anywhere for granted are you ready to work hard and win this election  well that is exactly the right answer because we need to do everything we possibly can between now and the time the polls close one week from tonight because any issue you care about  anything  is at stake i get sometimes a little overwhelmed of the fact that i love this country and i think we are great  and i think   were not going backwards were going forward   focus on whats important dont get distracted dont get diverted focus on  create   lets stay focused on one thing on you on your lives your families the problems that keep you up at night and thats what im doing now because i know the day after the election thats what really counts  ask yourself what kind of president and commander in chief do we need to get the economy working for everyone not just those at the top  who can keep us safe and lead the world with intelligence and steadiness and strength  who can begin to heal the divides that have been exacerbated between us and bring americans together again well ill tell you what donald trump has proven himself to be temperamentally unfit and unqualified to be president of the united states  you know i dont say that about everybody i have known a lot of the people who ran for president on both sides republicans and democrats i disagreed with them dont get me wrong but i never thought they were unfit to serve donald trump is different he has proven himself unfit and what he is doing with his conspiracy theories with his insulting with his demeaning and degrading millions of americans proves he should not be allowed anywhere near the white house  so on the one hand youve got to feel kind of sorry about the kind of campaign hes running dont you i mean he starts by insulting immigrants he moves on to insult all latinos he insults african americans he insults muslims he insults people with disabilities he insults pows he then insults women   by the time you add up all the people hes insulted thats more than half the population of the united states  but heres the good news the good news is there is another vision for america thats on the ballot  instead of dark and divisive it is hopeful and inclusive its bighearted not smallminded its about lifting people up not tearing each other down  it is a vision that says and i believe this with all my heart we are stronger together there is nothing we cant do   and we believe in an america that is great because it is good we believe in an america where women are respected   where veterans are honored   where parents are supported where workers are paid fairly and we believe in an america of second chances where people who have served their debt to society get a real chance to rebuild their lives   so we can end the schooltoprison pipeline and build a cradletocollege pipeline instead  and we believe in an america that will lead the world in the fight against climate change   and create millions of cleanenergy jobs we believe in an america where marriage is a right and discrimination is wrong  and we believe in an america that believes in the world and lives up to our values an america where women finally get equal pay for the work they do  we believe in an america where we will raise the national minimum wage so no one working full time will still be in poverty  we believe in an america where we will defeat terrorists because we will work with our allies in order to put together the coalition that can do that  we believe in an america where we know the difference between our allies and our adversaries  and we believe in an america where were finally do something about the violence of gun epidemics that kill  people a year  we believe in an america where every young person can afford to go to college and not go into debt  we believe in an america where were going to help people who already have student debt pay it back faster more cheaply   we believe in an america where were going to provide quality affordable health care to every person and that includes bringing down the cost of prescription drugs and guaranteeing the security    social security is a solemn promise well not privatize it we will not turn it over to wall street like my opponent wants to do  we believe in an america where people making less than  should not have an increase in their federal income taxes but the wealthy should pay their fair share  and we believe in an america where we grow the economy from the middle up and the bottom up not the discredited trickledown economics that donald trump has been advocating for and you know by the way we believe in an america where if somebody claims hes worth  billion he ought to pay some federal income tax  did any of you see the debates   so you know i spent fourandahalf hours  watching donald trump which proves conclusively i have the stamina to do this job   so one of the things i said  i just  when i learned him and studied him and realized  it just sort of stunned me standing next to a guy who flies around in a blue jet who flies around in a helicopter he has his name on those he has his name on buildings and actually one half of the working undocumented immigrants in america pay more in federal income tax than he does  you live in an america where were going to finally have comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship  we believe in an america where women are treated with respect  and as i was in pasco county earlier today talking about whats at stake in this election i was introduced by a former miss universe pageant winner alicia machado who donald trump has insulted and denigrated and really oh if youre miss universe you look pretty good right  and donald trump called her miss piggy insulted her heritage called his miss housekeeping because shes a latina well i was proud of her she doesnt let such a small person get her down  but ive got to say that i listened to what he said and how he talks about women and what he has bragged about doing to women i want all the girls in america to know you are valuable you should feel good about yourselves   and i want to say to all the young boys show respect because that shows you youre a real man and you   so you know literally i mean this is so much fun and its really late but i could be here all night  election  but i think you already know because youve been out here and youve been willing to be here with me because we know that weve got to turn out the vote  and what means is that every one of you who can should vote early how many of you have already voted  and it doesnt surprise me because four million people in florida have already voted  but there are millions more that weve got to get to go out and vote which is what i hope we will do talk to your friends your family members your coworkers it is pretty easy to vote early in florida there are lots of different places in this county and every other neighboring county for you to go to and its important to tell people who got ballots in the mail fill them out and send them in because we need everybody to step up and remember theres no state where its more important you know what happened in  right i was with al gore in miami and he can tell you better than anyone every vote counts especially here in broward county  and you know this is not complicated if people who support our positive inclusive unifying vision vote we win  and we will make history on november the th  so if youve already voted come work with us make some of the calls were making millions of calls knocking on thousands hundreds of thousands of doors to encourage everybody to be sure to vote and you know you can vote right near here at the african american    but there are dozens of other sites and all sites in broward county are open from  am to  pm every day until november the th so if you dont know where youre supposed to vote thats easy too you can go to iwillvotecom and that will tell you the nearest earlyvoting location to where you live and i want you to also do me another favor if you know anybody who says theyre thinking of voting from trump i want you to stage an intervention  and i want you to talk to this person because unless theyre a billionaire who avoided paying taxes for  years and lost a billion dollars running casinos they dont have anything to gain from donald trump in fact we do have so much to lose every single issue we care about may not be actually listed on the ballot but make no mistake its on there and talk to your friend and your coworker and say no really you may be angry about something but anger is not a plan  dont be used dont be exploited stand up for what we can do together because thats what this election ultimately comes down to its about our future its about who we are as a country and i promise you this if you give me the great honor of serving as your president i will wake up every day in that white house trying to figure out what i can do   americas best days are still ahead of us  dark pessimistic vision its not true and its not who we are as americans so at least stand up and we say no were rejecting that were not going back we are going to move with confidence in the future forward into the kind of potential that makes it possible for every single person to live up to his or her godgiven potential then were going to grow the future we want together and were going to prove once and for all that love trumps hate"
26,"Clinton","it is great to be here  thank you  i  i am very happy to be in the home of the steelers  and i really appreciate having my two escorts mel blount and franco harris  i am very grateful to have this chance to be in pittsburgh so close to this election now i know the steelers have a big on sunday against baltimore  lets hear it for coach tomlin and the team  his wonderful wife kiya is here and im very proud to have the support of dan rooney and pat rooney and the entire rooney family  dan was a great ambassador to ireland when i was secretary of state and wherever he goes hes a great ambassador for pittsburgh so i thank dan and i thank jim rooney who was so helpful in putting this together and everyone from the steelers family now youve just heard two terrific speeches havent you  i cant tell you how excited i am to be back here in pittsburgh with one of your own somebody who has made it but never forgot where he came from someone who i really admire because of the way hes done his business and its an absolute honor mark to have your support in this campaign  and ill  ill have more to say about my friend katie mcginty but boy i hope youre gonna send her to washington  i also  i want to recognize my friend and former colleague senator bob casey who is here  pittsburgh mayor bill peduto is here  allegheny county executive rich fitzgerald who is here  and  and two great labor leaders who are also here the president of the american federation of teachers randi weingarten is here  and the president of the united steel workers leo gerard is here  its great to have all of these strong supporters out in these last four days thats all thats left in what may be the most important election of our lifetimes so are you ready to vote pittsburgh   are you ready to volunteer for these last four days to get out to vote   are you ready to elect katie mcginty to the united states senate  ill tell you ive known katie shes a real fighter and she will be the kind of independent voice that pennsylvania families deserve and unlike her opponent shes never been afraid to stand up to donald trump  and now let me ask you are you ready to choose our next president and commanderinchief    wow ill tell you   i think this is one of the best places for a crowd event ever  folks  folks here get all fired up and energized and  i have to ask you did  did any of you see the debates   well i spent four and halfhours standing next to donald trump proving conclusively i have stamina to be the next president  but you know he said so many  so many things in those debates   you know when you debate in front of you know    million plus people you gotta  you gotta have a sense of preparation readiness calmness composure and ill tell you some of what i heard coming from my opponent it was really hard not to go what did you say  you know he kept  he kept saying things like well what have you done for  years and well we know what hes done for  years and i mean back in the s he started with discriminating against africanamericans and latinos by refusing to rent them apartments in new york  he has a long history of insulting people it did not just start in the campaign you can go back and  and find what he said about all kinds of folks and one of the things i discovered in preparing for the debates which i was kind of surprised by is that he took out a full page in  to criticize president reagan so he is an equal opportunity insulter  you know but i did choose a different path from him ive spent my career fighting for kids and families and im proud that i have  i helped to start something called the childrens health insurance program as first lady  it covers eight million kids and i have to tell you that traveling around pennsylvania  really anywhere in the country  i meet people who have been affected by the kinds of changes that we can do that give more folks a chance to get ahead im all about making sure the american dream is big enough for everybody  and were going to knock down the barriers that stand in the way and you know if you dont have your health its pretty hard to get ahead right and so i meet families who tell me about what that meant and it makes me very grateful and i was a senator from new york on    and i spent my eight years in the senate helping to rebuild new york keep us safer at home and to provide health care to our brave first responders our firefighters our police our emts who ran toward danger  and as your secretary of state i traveled to  countries negotiated ceasefires reduced the threat of nuclear weapons   stood up for human rights and womens rights and workers rights and lgbt rights around the world  now i  i really believe that if you want to get things done thatll help people you start by listening to people bringing them together and i know that is not very exciting i admit and i do feel kind of sorry for the press covering me because what are they going to say for the th time she was listening to people  i get that but everything ive done started there and then you bring people together you put them around the table they dont all agree with each other and then you work to find common ground thats what i did in the senate and as secretary of state i couldve never gotten anything done if i hadnt worked with republicans   and others who had different points of view and i want you to know if you elect me on tuesday that is the kind of president i will be listening   learning finding common ground  and from the very first day of this campaign ive been putting forward my ideas about how to help you and your families get ahead and i truly believe you deserve a candidate you can vote for not just someone to vote against  and so you can go to my website tim kaine and i wrote a book called stronger together because i want you to know what the agenda is and i want you to hold me accountable when i come back to pittsburgh which i hope to do on a regular basis   i want people to say hey you know i saw where you wanted to do more on infrastructure hows that going how many new jobs do we have what kinds of opportunities do we have with clean renewable energy jobs what about raising the national minimum wage  now one way or another america is going to have a new president on january th right and people say all the time that they want change well we will get change change is inevitable that is certain the question is what kind of change are we going to have  and  and heres where i think the choice could not be clearer are we going to build a stronger fairer better america or are we going to fear each other and the future hunker down against each other i dont think that will lead to anything positive and what i hope we will do in this election and in these remaining four days is to think about the kind of country we want imagine what we can do together every time i come into pittsburgh now because i started driving through pittsburgh decades ago because my dad was from scranton and we drove through pennsylvania every year  we took different routes and we went to different places and i  with my own eyes  have seen the ups and the downs of this great city and now when i drive in what do i see i see a positive optimistic confident city making progressive moving forward  and i dont think you do anything in life unless you kind of imagine what it will look like and then you get to work to do it thats how mark has built these great companies right here in pittsburgh when he was a young guy and working hard for everything he had he got a chance to start imagining and then he got a chance to start acting and producing results well thats the way it works thats the way it works with the steelers right i mean people imagine what the team can be like they plan the coaches they work hard the players like mel and franco they practice they plan you dont just say hey just get out on the field do whatever you want  thats not the way it works my friends and so what im hoping is that we will imagine two different americas just for the sake of this exercise imagine its donald trump standing in front of the capitol  and we already know a lot about him someone who demeans women mocks people with disabilities insults african americans and latinos and demonizes immigrants and muslims and pits people against each other instead of pulling us together and think about what it would mean to entrust the nuclear codes to someone   with a very thin skin who lashes out at anyone who challenges him imagine how easily it could be that donald trump would feel insulted and start a real war  not just a twitter war  at  in the morning imagine what it would mean for our economy to have someone who built his career exploiting workers stiffing small businesses now you heard earlier from andrew tesoro he designed a building for donald trump trump told him he loved it it was at one of his golf courses and then trump would not pay the bill now andrew didnt have the resources to sue the trump organization so trump just walked away from what was owed this is someone who personally signed  not some executive  he personally signed a contract with a unionbusting firm to keep workers at one of his hotels from being able to organize and bargain collectively  and just yesterday donald trump was told he was breaking the law by not negotiating with his hotel workers in las vegas and we know  and the steelworkers sure know  he chose to build two of his buildings with chinese steel and aluminum instead of supporting americas steel industry and american steelworkers  everywhere he goes he leaves people behind you know one of my goals as president is to encourage more companies to do what mark did with profitsharing if any of you were with us when mark endorsed me tim kaine and i were here in pittsburgh and he talked about how he had shared the profits of his company including the profits he gained when he sold his companies i think you told me mark you made  millionaires at your first company  look weve got to have a strong private sector we need business to be creating more jobs i really like the kind of jobs and business that mark does because what he is to worry about and take care the people who helped made him successful in the first place  now imagine having a president who owes hundreds of millions of dollars to foreign banks and other foreign entities that he doesnt tell us about ask yourself so if hes sitting across the table negotiating with people from those countries is he going to put his own financial interests ahead of americas interests i can tell you this when im sitting across the table from the russians or anyone else i know who im representing the american people and our interests  now my friends we got some good news this morning our economy created  jobs last month  that is  that is  straight months of job growth  and i believe that our economy is poised to really take off and thrive but we need to make sure the economy is working for everyone not just those at the top and that is my pledge i believe in growth from the middle out and the bottom up when the middle class thrives america thrives  donald trump believes something different he wants an economy that works for him thats why he wants to give the biggest tax breaks in history to the super wealthy and big corporations his own family would get a  billion tax break now   figure that out we know he hasnt paid taxes right if it turns out that hes as rich as he claims it would be trickle down economics on steroids the wealthy would be paying lower tax rates than ever his plan  and this is what i want you to hear  so hes taking care of himself hes taking care of his family hes taking care of the super wealthy and corporations his plan would actually raise taxes on  million lowincome and middle class people  he would hit especially hard   percent of single parents would see their taxes go up  that means that  working families in pennsylvania would pay more under donalds plan honestly i dont know how he lives with himself doesnt he see  doesnt he see what we see the millions of moms and dads struggling to make ends meet balance the demands of work and family or does he just not care remember this is a man who said pregnancy is an inconvenience for an employer  he has said and i quote putting a wife to work is a very dangerous thing  well i see things differently when i say we need to make the economy work for everyone not just those at the top i mean everyone families are facing a lot of pressures in many families women are contributing to the income of their families or they are the sole  the sole income in the family  more people than ever are working gigs on the side just to make extra money or to make ends meet and for working families the cost of everything is going up from childcare to prescription drugs to college education and i think we all know somebody whos working two minimum wage jobs and trying to raise their families at the same time its hard being good workers and good parents and we know young people who want to start a small business the way mark did it when he got going and maybe they want to buy a first home or they just got married and theyre trying to get ahead in life but student debt is holding them back and i want us to know that i will do everything i can to help ease the costs of middle class and working and poor families so that more people   can do better  and right now so many of the people  so many of the people who are doing the toughest most important jobs in our country are getting paid the least and a lot of them are women and people of color right childcare workers trying to take care of our kids   nurses who work the night shift and spend more time with their patients than the doctors do the home health aides who keep our seniors independent and healthy  there are so many jobs of value to our society where the paychecks dont reflect how important they are so i will do everything i can to get incomes rising for hardworking people whether you work in steel whether you work in a factory whether youre a machinist a nurse a teacher a firefighter a police office whatever you are you deserve to be part of a growing thriving middleclass economy  and so thats why  thats why were going to raise the national minimum wage   and were going to join every other advanced economy and make sure weve got paid family and medical leave so you can take care of the people you love  and here it is  dont you think its finally time to guarantee equal pay for women  well i got to tell you this is not a womans issue its a family issue if you have a mother a wife a daughter a sister you want her to be paid equally because that goes to your familys bottom line now ive gotten sort of used to the fact that when i talk about equal pay or paid family leave or affordable child care donald trump and his supporters say im playing the woman card well ill tell you what if fighting for those kids and family issues is playing the womens card you know what i say deal me in  we are going to invest in our people especially our young people we dont have anybody to waste or leave behind we cant leave any talent on the sidelines and weve got to make sure we fight against discrimination  weve got to work in communities where factories have closed and nothing has come in to replace it like so many places in central and western pa and were going to make the biggest investment in good paying jobs since world war ii theres a lot of good work to be done in this country and that work will put people in jobs here in america that cannot be exported theyve got to be done right here  so my friends were going to make our economy stronger for decades were going to make america the st century clean energy superpower   were going to produce enough renewable energy to power every home were going to make it easier for small businesses and entrepreneurs to get the credit they need to grow and were going to make it possible again to say and believe it that in america if you can dream it you can build it  and part of that dream is making sure people get the education and the skills they need so heres what i want to do starting in preschool i want to better prepare every kid to do well in real school right  i want every kid to have good schools and good teachers in every zip code in america not just some  i want us to bring back technical education to high school and once again   lift up those good paying necessary jobs that dont require a fouryear college degree  i want us to do more with our community colleges and more apprenticeship programs by unions and businesses to help prepare people  and i am tired of meeting young people that cant either start or finish college because they cant afford it  were going to make public colleges and universities tuitionfree if you make less than  a year  and for people who are   you know i make lists all the time  i make lists of my lists  but i have a list about what were going to do and its because it all comes down to this i love our country and i believe in the american people and i know theres nothing we cant achieve if we work together  so as you head to the polls as you talk to your friends and neighbors who might still be deciding who to vote for please ask them to search their heart about what kind of country we want for our kids and our grandkids  it is not as important that they think about voting for me as it is they think about voting for themselves  every issue we care about is on the ballot on tuesday and i know that if we have a big win on tuesday we will have a big wind behind our backs going into the government in january  so tell everybody please to vote and that you can make the difference going to the polls on tuesday november th if you dont know where to vote go to iwillvotecom to confirm your voting location or to find out how to send in an absentee ballot we are on track right now to having the biggest turn out in american history  people in states where they have early voting have already set a record we have  million people whove already voted  and if you know anybody here in pittsburgh or in western pa whos thinking about voting for trump please stage an intervention before its too late  i mean really just sit down with them and ask them what they care about and if they say theyre just frustrated or angry say you understand but angers not a plan  weve got work to do were going to roll up our sleeves and were going to do it together  and if you can give us any time  if you can give us any time to volunteer go to hillaryclintoncom to sign up or text join join at  because believe me i dont want any of us  not me and not you  to wake up on wednesday and think if wed only done a little bit more things would have turned out differently sometimes the fate of the greatest nations comes down to single moments in time this is one of those makeorbreak moments for the united states it is in your hands  and when your kids and your grandkids ask what you did in  when everything was on the line i hope youll be able to say i voted for a better stronger fairer america   where we build  walls we dont build walls we build bridges and where we build the future that we want and where we prove once and for all that love trumps hate  thank you all god bless you"
27,"Clinton","thank you ill tell you i am so glad to be back in michigan  and that introduction im just still vibrating from it i thank my longtime friend reverend wendell anthony for giving us some of the best lines that weve had in the whole campaign thank you wendell  you know theres something special about this place and some of you may have recognized the song that was playing that when i came in an amazing anthem sung by the talented andra day called rise up  and that is what detroit is doing you are rising up and that is exactly what were going to do in america were going to rise up and make sure the american dream is big enough for everyone  im looking forward to working with the great team you have here in detroit and in michigan i want to thank your senators senator debbie stabenow and senator gary peters  i want to thank your members of congress congressman john conyers sandy levin congressman brenda lawrence and debbie dingell i want to thank your great mayor mayor mike duggan thank you  wayne county executive warren evans sheriff bennie napoleon the president of the uaw dennis williams  longtime friends and former colleagues of mine former senator carl levin and his wife barbara are here and to all who are present today i was delighted that my friend and my supporter mark cuban could be here because hes not only a real billionaire   hes actually shared his profits with his employees  now are you ready to vote on tuesday  are you ready to volunteer to get everybody out to vote  are you ready to choose our next president and commanderin chief  did any of you see the three debates that we had well i spent four and a half hours standing next to donald trump proving once and for all i have the stamina to be the next president  he kept saying a lot of unusual things didnt he and you know theres a certain preparation you do to be ready for those debates and of course i did it because i think you should prepare to be president of the united states  and i did practice my composure people said to me well how did you do that the things he was saying and then that second debate when he was following you around and lurching over you i said well i did practice and i had my friends and my family just spend hours saying terrible things to me so i was ready but he would say well what have you done for  years and you know i dont want to brag  but i do think i do think it matters what youve done and especially what youve done that maybe improves somebody elses life right and one of the great joys of this campaign has been traveling around our country meeting people who have been affected by what weve been doing for example as first lady i helped create the childrens health insurance program which covers  million kids  and these are families that you know they are not poor families they are working people but they dont make enough money and they dont work for somebody who provides insurance and so very often their kids were being affected by not getting the healthcare they should have had i met a woman whose baby daughter when she was born was diagnosed as totally deaf and the doctor said you know were sorry theres really nothing we can do for her but this mother like many mothers i know did not take that for an answer right she got on the internet she began to research and she found that there were treatments that she could maybe provide to her little daughter but they were expensive and she and her husband didnt have that kind of money and they didnt have insurance she was at her doctors office and just so distraught and the doctor said well theres this new thing called the childrens health insurance program maybe you should look into it turned out she was eligible she signed up she started getting her daughter the best healthcare that every child in this country should be able to have by the way  and when i was in north carolina i heard about her and got to meet her but more than that i met her daughter who talked to me and who just graduated from college because she got the health care and she got the treatment that she deserved to have  ill tell you what that is how i judge my last  years have i done something to help somebody else i am well aware of the blessings that i have had and i want to be sure that all of us figure out a way to pay it forward make it possible for more families more kids to have the chance to live up to their own godgiven potential  and i was a senator in new york on  so i know what can happen the evil and the hatred of terrorism i saw it and i spent my time helping to rebuild new york city and helping to get healthcare for the brave first responders who ran toward danger not away from it our police our firefighters our emts and ill tell you who else we got covered we got construction workers who ran with their supplies and their tools and i see one right out there who knows exactly what im talking about  all across the city people were leaving their jobsites and rushing toward danger that was america at its best and dont ever forget what we are capable of being who we are we are not afraid we are brave courageous people who will do our best if given the chance  and as your secretary of state i went to  countries negotiated ceasefires reduced the threat of nuclear weapons stood up for human rights and womens rights and workers rights and lgbt rights  im telling you this because i want you to know that i will do everything i can if i am honored to be your president i will get up every day in that white house and i will go to work for you and your families to make it possible for you to have the chances and the opportunities you deserve to have  i want you to have a candidate you can vote for not just someone to vote against thats why tim kaine and i have run a campaign based on ideas and issues not insults  because if you really take a look at whats at stake in this election it is a choice between two very different visions for america ive got to say when i hear my opponent talk about america i dont recognize the country hes talking about it is so dark so divisive so hateful that is not the america that i believe in i believe that we should have a confident optimistic inclusive vision of where were going and how were going to get there  i love our country and i believe in the american people and i think theres nothing we cant achieve if we work together and we set some goals and we go after them   see we believe in an america that is bighearted not small minded we believe in an america that is already great but can be greater if we do our part  and we believe america is great because america is good never forget that if we lift each other up and not tear each other down we can go even further and i believe with all my heart thats why the slogan of my campaign sums it up that we are stronger together  and so come next january th america is going to have a new president  i know that a lot of people say that they want change well let me tell you this change is inevitable there will be change the question is what kind of change are we going to have  are we going to build a stronger fairer better country or are we going to fear the future and each other i sure hope not that is not the america that i believe we are so heres what i want to ask you to do i want you to talk to your friends and your family your neighbors michigan is one of these states that doesnt have early voting ive been all over the country going to states that are already voting in fact about   to  million people have already voted in those states but michigan votes on tuesday  and i imagine i imagine there are some of you who know people who say theyre going to vote for donald trump right  i know i understand that i mean i would hope youd try to stage an intervention before its too late  but maybe you can ask them with you to imagine imagine january th  and imagine that my opponent is taking the oath of office in front of the capitol  imagine having a president who demeans women and mocks the disabled who insults africanamericans and latinos and muslims  who personally engages in busting unions and preventing people from having the right to bargain collectively  now the truth is we really dont have to imagine what that would be like because everything he has said and done both in his career and in this campaign tells you what could happen you know michelle obama who says so many wise and wonderful things  she said the presidency doesnt change who you are it reveals who you are and i think weve seen who donald trump is maya angelou another great american maya angelou said when someone shows you who he is believe him the first time  and if my opponent were to win we would have a president who has only ever been in it for himself just last year he said again it wouldnt have mattered if wed rescued the auto industry or let it go bankrupt  what is he talking about im proud that president obama saved the auto industry  and im even prouder that because of the hard work of people in detroit and across michigan and the midwest the us auto industry just had its best year ever  if donald wins the election we have a president who wants to ban every muslim in the world from coming to visit the united states  we are a country founded our religious freedom that runs contrary to our constitution we would have a president who has said repeatedly that he thinks the lives of the black people are all about crime and poverty and despair  he has no idea about the strength of the black church in the vibrancy of blackowned businesses the excellence of historically black colleges and universities  he seems to know nothing about the rise of a new generation of black activists and the success of black leaders in every field  i think he needs a visit from reverend wendell anthony dont you  yesterday in north carolina i was honored to stand with a woman named may brown wiggins decades ago she was a hardworking nurse in new york city she was looking for an apartment that she could afford to rent but donald trump and his father fred turned her away you see whenever africanamericans tried to rent trump apartments their application was marked with a c c for colored  and that didnt sit very well with may so she went to the authorities and eventually the department of justice sued the trumps for housing discrimination  and although they settled they wouldnt change so the government had to take them back to court thats a pattern this is what happens time and time again with my opponent if he were to win he would be in charge of the federal housing department if he doesnt respect all americans now how can we trust him to serve all americans in the future  he has such a casual disregard of our constitution he doesnt seem to understand that the rule of law that we really are a nation of laws not men  heres the latest example there is a terrible crime back in  in new york city it was called the central park five maybe some of you have heard of it there were five black and latino kids some as young as  they were wrongfully convicted and they were in prison where they spent years donald trump took out fullpage ads calling for the death penalty for the kids and even after they were exonerated by dna evidence as someone else confessed to that terrible crime trump actually said they should still be in prison  it doesnt matter if you are innocent if he decides that you should be in prison or you should be locked up  no wonder he admires vladimir putin because thats exactly what putin does to his people  so we cant trust him with our constitution we cant trust him to obey the rule of law he has shown us who he is now we have to decide who we are so let me paint you a different picture heres what were going to do together if we win this election on tuesday night  we have three big three big challenges number one weve got to get the economy working for everyone not just those at the top  number two weve got to keep our country safe and we have to work with our allies to lead the world with strength and intelligence for peace and prosperity  and number three weve got to bring our country together weve got to overcome these divides we have to heal our nation and i hope that you will help me meet all three of those challenges  i have said repeatedly that were going to take on discrimination and bigotry because any time we hold somebody back it can lead to holding other people back we cant accept as normal what were seeing across our country because of his campaign a church in mississippi was burned this week someone painted vote trump on the side and then set it on fire  we cant let that happen what happened in flint michigan should not be normal or acceptable  our kids should be guaranteed clean air and clean water those are basics and weve got to do everything we can to make sure that we take care of our children and its important for us to recognize that when i talk about getting the economy to work for everybody that means i want the biggest jobs program since world war ii infrastructure advanced manufacturing clean renewable energy technology  some people say we cant do that well im telling you they are wrong they are wrong we have the best workers the most productive workers were going to give them more to work on more products to produce  and were going to do more for small business because small business is the backbone of so many communities  i want everybody to have the chance to succeed in america that means were going to dismantle the socalled school to prison pipeline and replace it with a cradle to college pipeline  were going to make sure that every child has a chance to go to a good school with good teachers no matter what zip code that child lives in  and i want to start with our youngest kids with prekindergarten program and then i want to be able to partner with our teachers weve got to have high expectations and get results in helping our children and i want to be sure that we put technical education back into high school because there are good jobs out there waiting for young people with the skills to do them  it will be important that we create an environment in which our police and our communities can work together and trust each other i believe we are all safer when everyone has respect for the law and everyone is respected by the law and thats what were going to work for  were also going to take commonsense steps to reduce gun violence and save lives  this has nothing to do with the scare tactics coming from my opponent have you seen hes starting to wear a camo hat now really we are going to work with responsible gun owners who understand that weve got to keep guns out of the hands of people who shouldnt have them in the first place  and while we create more safe communities we want to invest in those communities i want to continue the good work that our past two democratic presidents have done one named clinton one named obama  and i want to be a really strong partner ill compete a little with them but i want to be a real strong partner with detroit and other cities that are on the way back up to make sure you get the investment and the support the housing and the jobs that you need but we also have to make sure our economy is fairer thats why i believe we should raise the national minimum wage because people who work fulltime should not be left in poverty  and isnt it finally time to guarantee equal pay for women  this is not a womans issue if you have a wife a mother a daughter or a sister who works its your issue its a family issue and every time i talk about wanting to have affordable childcare paid family leave equal pay for women the other side accuses me of playing the womans card ill tell you what if standing up for equal pay is playing the womans card then deal me in  and one of the other one of the other big challenges were going to take on i am so excited about this you know im really proud of the campaign that bernie sanders and i ran because it was a campaign about issues and what we decided after it was over is how we can work together to make sure that everybody who wants to go to college can afford not just to start but actually to graduate  so we came up with a plan that if you go to a public college or university you will go tuition free if your family makes less than  a year  and it will be debtfree for everybody above that so you dont go into debt  for people who already have student debt were going to help you pay it down and pay it off to get out from under it  and i want especially to support historically black colleges and universities that have done so much to bring forth a leadership cadre in our country this is just some of what we are offering in this campaign because we really believe you need to look at what will happen after the election now i had a friend say to me the other day you know people are just frustrated and angry i get that i understand that we had the worst economic collapse since the great depression in  and  millions of people lost their jobs millions lost their homes family wealth was wiped out that is a trauma and people are still suffering and still climbing back from that i get it but i learned a long time ago from my late mother anger is not a plan all right be angry vent about it and then roll up your sleeves and get to work  thats what i will do thats why we put this all down its on our website hillaryclintoncom its in a book that tim kaine and i put out called stronger together because not only do i want you to know what i will try to do as your president i want you to hold me accountable i want you  i want you when i come back to detroit which i will do when i travel around michigan which i will do i want you to say well hows it going getting those new jobs started how much progress are we making on making sure college is affordable i believe in making lists maybe its a womans thing  my husband said to me one time you have lists of your lists well i do because i want to know what were going to get done and how we can make progress together and ultimately this election really is about the kind of country we want for our kids and in my case now my grandkids are we really a nation that believes in freedom and justice for all are we really a nation that recognizes our best years can still be ahead of us if we make up our minds to have that be our goal  i believe we can do this together my opponent at his convention said i alone can fix it well no nobody alone does anything when our founders met in philadelphia it wasnt one person creating our country it was many people working together and fighting a revolution to get that democracy and then to fight for civil rights and voting rights and workers rights and womens rights and lgbt rights  none of them none of them were won by one person alone the american labor movement didnt happen to get somebody one day say i alone make it happen it took millions of people in every one of these movements marching and speaking out and sitting in barack obama wasnt put into the white house by one person alone it took everybody working and organizing and yes voting that is how progress happens in america  so really it all comes down to you my friends you have to vote our progress is on the line everything that has happened up until this point is on the line im ready to defend and build on the progress that weve made im proud i was a member of president obamas cabinet im proud that he and i are friends  but he knows and i know that american leadership american presidents its like running a relay you do your very best and then you pass off the baton and you just hope that the person you had it off to doesnt drop to the ground or doesnt turn around and run back the way we came from which is what my opponent is promising to do  now ive told the president that when he hands off the baton hes going to have to bend over hes a lot taller than i am but im excited about what we can do i know this is been a tough campaign ive got people coming up to me saying theyve got migraines they never had before they have stomachaches that they dont know what theyre going to do with i get it it has been in many ways a really tough campaign but ill tell you what michigan you can make the difference  all im asking you is talk to your friends talk to your family talk to your coworkers talk to everybody if you have time to volunteer go to hillaryclintoncom to volunteer or text join because when your children  and there are some beautiful children in this crowd here today  when your children or grandchildren ask what you did in  when everything was on the line i want you to be able to say i voted for a better stronger fairer america  an america where we build bridges not walls  and where we prove once and for all that love trumps hate lets get to work thank you detroit thank you michigan god bless you"

29,"Clinton","i  i am  i am so so touched and so grateful to be here in manchester with all of you  and particularly with mr khan  as  as he was speaking i saw several of you holding up your constitutions  and he reminded us all of the fundamental values that set us apart as americans he and his family exemplify the values that make america great and in a race that has been marked by ugly suspicion and insults and attacks of all kinds against immigrants and muslims and so many others mr khan i think reminded all of us that we are americans his son was an american who gave his life for our country we cherish the constitution and we will defend it  in fact when a president is sworn in on inauguration day thats the oath that a new president swears to  to preserve protect and defend the constitution the first words i ever heard from mr khan were about his sons courageous final moments serving our country in iraq he told the other troops in his unit to get back from a suspicious vehicle approaching their position but he went forward he took  steps toward danger before that car exploded after his death he was awarded both the bronze star and the purple heart and heres what mr khan said   that really struck a chord with me and as the story he just told us of the mother telling him about her son being bullied these are words that i would hope that all americans and particularly young americans would hear and heed mr khan said we still wonder what made him take those  steps maybe thats the point where all the values all the service to country all the things he learned in this country kicked it it was those values that made him take those ten steps and those ten steps mr khan went on to say told us  meaning he and his wife and his family  told us we did not make a mistake in moving to this country  in fact i think we should all be grateful that this remarkable family decided to make america their home we should be grateful for everyone who looks at america and sees a beacon of hope worth defending  this means so much  this means so much to me because like all of you i love our country  and i believe with all my heart that our best days are still ahead of us if we reach for them together i also believe as mr khan and were talking before we came on that we will have some work to do to bring about healing and reconciliation after this election we have to begin listening to one another and respecting one another  because our core values are being tested in this election but when i meet people  when i have a chance to hear from them about what they want for themselves and their families my faith in our future has never been stronger this election is a moment of reckoning it is a choice between division or unity between strong steady leadership or a loose cannon who could put everything at risk  and so my friends this is one of these elections that really is a crossroads election in our country im grateful to be joined tonight by so many wonderful people theres a big overflow  there are several overflows and i hope they can all hear my voice  i want to thank james taylor for that wonderful performance  so many of his songs are a part of the soundtrack for american and its wonderful that he could be here with us along with his wife kim  im thrilled to be with your next senator maggie hassan  maggie will bring a wealth of experience to washington she will bring the skills that enabled her to work across the aisle in the legislature and with the legislature and we need that kind of common sense problemsolving approach  that independent voice that new hampshire so deserves to have so i hope and trust you will send maggie to the senate on tuesday  and i hope you will send colin van ostern to the governorship  colin will build on maggies record of accomplishment and i think about all of the jobs that have been created in this state how college has been made more affordable how youve taken on the epidemic of addiction youre doing it the new hampshire way and both maggie and colin represent that  i sure think washington needs more of that and i want you also to know how important it is to send congresswoman annie kuster and congresswoman carol shaeporter to washington as well  both annie and carol will bring the same attitude about rolling up their sleeves and getting to work for you that we really need in the congress right now and another great member of the senate whos been up here campaigning for maggie and talking about what will make the senate work better is the senator from rhode island sheldon whitehouse whos here with us  and finally  finally i want to just recognize a new hampshire native who is now the attorney general of massachusetts attorney general maura heeley  now elections are of course a choice  a choice between the people who are running but much more than that they are a choice about what we want to do in our country  what kind of country we want and they are often premised the visions  the views of the candidates and what ive tried to do in this campaign is to lay out an agenda  what a novel idea  i actually  i actually want you to know what i will try do if im so honored as to become your president  and my  my runningmate tim kaine and i got together and we  we put out a book called stronger together which has all of our policies in there its  yes i see somebody holding it up back there  because we dont only want you to know what we plan to do we want you to hold us accountable when i come back to new hampshire i want you to ask hows that college affordability plan going what are we doing about getting the cost of prescription down how are we managing the economy so that it produces more good jobs for everybody not just those at the top i want  i want us to have an ongoing discussion about how we are all going to contribute to making our country all it should be i really believe that americas best years are still ahead of us if we all do our part  and i  i think its fair to say after all the months of this campaign my opponent has a very dark and divisive view of our country sometimes when i hear him speak i honestly dont recognize the country that he is talking about sometimes im not sure he recognizes the country hes talking about  did any of you see the debates did you all see the debates  well i did spend fourandahalf hours next to donald trump in those debates proving conclusively i have the stamina to do this   but   but its also  but i  i think its  its  its also important that we believe in a hopeful inclusive bighearted united america right  where everyone has a place where everyone is included where people who are willing to work hard can get ahead and stay ahead where we recognize the importance of the american dream and we believe and we will ensure it is big enough for everyone not just a few  so i  i really believe that although my name and my opponents name may be on the ballot come tuesday whats really on the ballot is what kind of country we want for our children and our grandchildren  whats really on the ballot is every single issue we care about our constitution set up a system of government that has stood the test of time it can sometimes be frustrating provide challenges  we know that but here we are the longestlasting democracy in the history of the world that is to be cherished and nurtured not demeaned not degraded  now if you believe that our brave men and women in uniform like captain khan deserve a commanderinchief who knows what needs to be done then you have to vote dont leave it to chance dont leave it to others use your voice and your vote because my opponent actually said more countries should have nuclear weapons  and when a journalist asked him about using nuclear weapons he said well why do we make them i wonder if he even realizes hes talking about nuclear war the other day in ohio i was at kent state university and i was introduced by a man named bruce blair he had been in the air force decades ago and he was a launch officer in our nuclear program which meant that he sat in a bunker during his watch time in case the president  whoever the president was  were to order a nuclear attack and bruce blair knows there is no appeal from a presidents order to launch a nuclear attack there is no veto by the joint chiefs of staff or anybody else if a president orders a nuclear attack theres about a fourminute window before it happens i had never met mr blair before hes gone on to have a very distinguished career in security studies but as he was watching this campaign and reflecting on the service he did as a young man he realized he could never support donald trump and he called other launch officers  sometimes called missileers  and asked them what they were thinking and to a person they said this is unacceptable this is actually scary so several dozens of them wrote a letter saying that they know what the awesome responsibility is that a president of the united states holds and they could never support donald trump to be our president and commanderinchief  and if you  if you believe like i do that our economy grows and america thrives when the middle class grows and thrives then you have to vote too  were going to make the biggest investment in goodpaying jobs since world war ii  jobs and infrastructure and advanced manufacturing and clean energy small business jobs i want to be the best small business president weve ever had   to enable more people to get started and grow their businesses in contrast my opponent built his fortune on the backs of small business owners but im the daughter of a small businessman and i am just so glad my dad never got a contract from donald trump  because so many who did were stiffed but i want to make sure that we have easier access to capital less red tape more tax relief for people willing to take the risk of going in to small businesses i also think its imperative that we make our economy fairer and that means i do support raising the national minimum wage  because as i said i believe in work thats how i was raised and i think we can do better for people who work fulltime and still are mired in poverty we want to get back to having ladders of opportunity if you work in america you ought to be able to get ahead in america and were going to make that happen again  and weve got to start recognizing that families need more support and thats why i want to make child care affordable instead of costing as much as tuition  and it is time that we had paid family leave so that you can take care of the most important obligations that you have  and it is way past time to guarantee equal pay for womens work  and you know this is not just a womans issue this is a family issue if you have a mother a wife sister or daughter this is your issue and this is an issue worth voting on because its time we made it fair for working women  and if you believe all of our kids should have the chance to thrive in good schools with good teachers no matter what zip code they live in then you have to vote because weve got to make public education work for everyone  and i think we need some water yes  do we have some water that we can get here if we  if we have some water that would be a big help okay great now look i  i think when it comes to education we do need to have highquality affordable prekindergarten in every community i also believe we need to bring back technical and vocational education into our high schools  because a fouryear college degree should not be the only path to a good job and a middleclass life in new hampshire or in america  and for anyone who does want to go to college we are going to make it affordable  now after the primary was over  and i have to say you all cleaned my clock in the primary i know  but it was a great primary because it was about ideas and issues not insults and im proud of the race that senator sanders and i ran  and  and when it was over  when it was over we got together and we sat down and we said how can we work to deal with a lot of the issues that we were both concerned about in the primary and weve put together a plan  public colleges and universities should be tuition free for everyone who makes less than  a year  and it should be debtfree for everyone else we have to treat it like an investment  and bernie and i were just in north carolina campaigning together and its so exciting because we know that not only do we have make college affordable we also have to help the millions of americans who are already struggling with student debt to ease that burden get those interest rates down make it so you never have to pay more than you can afford  so you see working for children and families has been the cause of my life but its never been more important than it is right now and  and it will be our mission together doing everything we can to help all our kids and every american have the chance to live up to their godgiven potential i am taking very seriously the obligation that i feel to reach out to all americans im asking for the support not just of democrats but also republicans and independents in this election  i want to be the president for all americans  those who vote for me and those who do not vote for me because we have to heal this country and thats going to take everyone  we have to remember how to disagree without being so disagreeable  and you know it is unusual for somebody running for president to say that what we need more of in our country is love and kindness but we really do  toward one another toward people different from ourselves  we all have a role in building a better stronger fairer america and i am very honored to have gotten the kind of support i have received from republicans here in new hampshire and i really am very grateful for the recent statement by former senator gordon humphrey about whats at stake in this election  so  you know we cant do any of this work unless were successful on tuesday it really all starts then our future is in our hands and anyone who says theyre going to stay on the sidelines or it doesnt matter really doesnt understand whats at stake in this election weve got to get every american eligible to vote registered to vote and here in new hampshire youve got same day registration so you can all get out and vote  weve got to get everyone to believe that this election is about you it is about you  your dreams your aspirations your hopes your family your community i have never felt more strongly about what we can do together i am confident and i am optimistic about the future we can make together if you dont know where youre supposed to vote you can go to iwillvotecom they will tell you there you can still volunteer we have been knocking on hundreds of thousands of doors i bet some of yours right and some of you did the knocking  but we are  we are not taking anyone or anything or anyplace for granted so if you want to volunteer you can go to hillaryclintoncom or text join  it really comes down as far as im concerned for me personally to my grandchildren because i feel very blessed that i have had opportunities in our country because of my family and because of what others had done to prepare the path for me going back to our founding and i really want each and every one of us to think for a moment about how we would feel on november th if we were not successful when your kids and grandkids ask you what you did in  when everything was on the line i hope youre able to say you voted  you voted for a better stronger fairer america  an america where we build bridges not walls  an america where we prove once and for all that love trumps hate lets go vote new hampshire thank you god bless you"
30,"Clinton","oh my goodness thank you  thank you all so much  it is great to be back in cleveland i am thrilled to see all of you i have to really thank lebron what he does on the basketball court you all know it makes him so special it makes him a champion  but i am just as impressed as i have told him about what he does off the court  because what he does off the court is to care for every child as though that child were his own he has been so committed through the lebron family the lebron james family foundation hes using the national platform he earned to advocate for children everywhere especially right here in ohio  and it was an extraspecial treat to have jr smith here as well  i cant tell you how exciting it is for me to have lebron and jr part of the team thats going to take us to the white house starting on tuesday  i also have to thank a lot of the elected officials that ive worked with that i have such high regard for let me thank your senator sherrod brown  let me thank your amazing absolutely indefatigable congresswoman marcia fudge  let me thank your county executive armond budish  and let me thank and hope you will vote for your former governor ted strickland to be your next senator  i want to thank the dj steph floss for his musical performance  and i want to thank a very special young man yusef salaam who was out here  a young man who has turned what was a very bitter and unjust experience into an opportunity to try to help lift others up now i was thrilled to be here on friday night with jay z and beyonce  beyonce even had her dancers in blue pantsuits which i love  but what was most important was how beyonce and jay z talked about what this election means for their daughter and for all of our daughters and sons and thats why i am so grateful to them as well as to lebron because this election really is about the future and its about your kids and grandkids and every child in this country that we hope will have their own shot at the american dream they may not all become champion basketball players but everybody should have the right to go as far as their hard work and talent will take them in america  so let me ask you this are you ready to vote  are you ready to volunteer for the next few days  are you ready to choose our next president  well i think by now you know the choice could not be any clearer it really is a choice between division or unity between an economy that works for everyone or one that is stacked for those at the top between strong steady leadership or a loose cannon and as you think about this choice i want you to know where i am coming from because what i want to do as your president is really to build on and continue what ive done my entire life fighting for kids and families   standing up for our country if you elect me on tuesday thats what i will do every day as your president because from the start our campaign has been focused on you you know i have now spoken in front of hundreds and hundreds of thousands of people in small groups and big events and what i try to do while im up here speaking is to really look at the faces of the people in front of me because i dont know your dreams i dont know your struggles but i want so much to convey to you that i will be on your side i will fight for you fight for your families fight for your futures  i want us to do all we can to help you get ahead and stay ahead and my vision is very different from my opponents look we know we know enough about what he says and what hes done you dont need to go through the litany of all the people hes insulted and demeaned but the bottom line is his vision of america is so dark and divisive its not the america that i see as i travel around our country i want us to have a vision that is hopeful optimistic and unified about what we can do together to make sure americas best years are ahead of us  i love our country and i believe in our people and i will never ever quit on you   no matter what now that is not to say we dont have our challenges of course we do were just human beings but boy we have so many assets we have so many opportunities and never forget america is great because america is good  and if we act like that we lift each other up instead of tearing each other down we can be even greater weve come through some tough economic times and lots is changing in our country there are powerful forces inside and outside of america that do threaten to pull us apart and weve arrived at a moment of reckoning in this election our core values as americans are being tested i think of all the people ive met across the country in this campaign ive heard some really really sad stories you know when you run for president at least for me the moments that stand out are about somebody grabbing my hand ill be in a coffee shop or maybe shaking hands on a rope line and somebody will grab my hand and they will share a really personal feeling or experience with me a lot of times its about problems or troubles in their families and i feel like they are entrusting me with this really important piece of their lives i walk away from that motivated but i also walk away confident my faith in our future has never been stronger and i know if we come together not just to win the election thats just the beginning but then to work together there is something for every one of us to do in our own lives our families our neighborhoods and communities i want an america where everyone has a place where everyones included and you know i know theres a lot of frustration and even anger in this election season i see it i hear it sometimes you know im the subject of it i get it but anger is not a plan anger is not going to get us new jobs with rising incomes   that will create a strong thriving middle class i believe that were going to grow this economy were going to grow it from the middle out and the bottom up not the top down  that is what my opponent offers and it might work for him right it might but its not going to work for the vast majority of working americans thats why i want us to have a big infrastructure jobs program that is so much work to be done good honest honorable   dignified work our roads our bridges our ports our airports our tunnels our water systems and these are jobs that cant be exported theyve got to be done right here in cleveland   in youngstown in dayton in akron in columbus and cincinnati and were going to bring back advanced manufacturing to ohio and elsewhere in our country now some people when i say this they kind of you know look at me like well thats not going to happen it is going to happen and ill tell you two of my strongest allies are going to be sherrod brown and marcia fudge and i hope ted strickland when he gets to washington  people say to me all the time well how are you going to get anything done wont there be gridlock there will only be gridlock if people that are elected to represent you dont want to help you its not complicated my friends if they want to keep helping the wealthy the powerful and the wellconnected yeah then were going to have gridlock because i want jobs with rising incomes i want people having a better shot at the future  and we are going to have more clean renewableenergy jobs to combat climate change and put americans to work  and i want to be the best president small business has ever had because thats where most of the new jobs will come from  and once we get these new jobs and we start producing more things in america i want people to buy those things in america  you know any of you see the debates  you know in that last debate i pointed out that donald trump has bought chinese steel to build his last two buildings all the while hes been running around ohio talking about what a great advocate hes going to be for working people  he didnt have to buy chinese steel he didnt have to help employ chinese steelworkers he could have bought good american steel made by american steelworkers  so dont just watch what we say watch what weve done for the last  years and whose side weve bet on  and were going to make this economy fairer look i really believe in hard work thats how i was raised thats the kind of family i came from so i think everybody has to work everybody who can needs to work but i do think we need to raise the national minimum wage   because if you work full time you shouldnt still be in poverty and i also think if youre working you ought to get paid fairly which is why we need to guarantee equal pay for womens work  and you know this is not a womans issue this is a family issue because if youve got a mother a wife a sister or a daughter working you dont want her shortchanged   and we need to start recognizing that a lot of the costs that families are facing now are really burdensome i want to get child care affordable right  do you know in a lot of states right now good child care costs as much or more than instate college tuition thats crazy who could afford that and i want us to have paid family leave so if you get sick or your spouse is sick   or your parent is sick or your child is sick or you bring a newborn home now you know i dont think these are luxuries anymore i think these are all about rebuilding the american middle class i believe its all about respecting work providing enough jobs for people to have a good future getting incomes rising making it work for everybody and i have said i will pay for everything im proposing without adding a penny to the national debt right  and that is in very start contrast to my opponent because what ive said is i am not raising taxes on the middle class anybody making less than  a year is not going to have any tax increase while i am president  but i am going where the money is and the money is with the wealthy and corporations because theyve done really well in the last  years and they should pay their fair share to support our country  and again people say to me well how are you ever going to get that through congress well ill tell you i think its pretty simple im going to look at all the people all the people who would be helped by everything ive just said the new jobs and the rest of it and im going to compare it to the very few people in every congressional district who would have their taxes raised and im going to say whose side are you on mr or madam congresswoman are you supporting the five people in your district who will have their taxes raised or are you supporting the  people who will be benefited by what were going to do together  and another big barrier that weve got to knock down is making college affordable for every single person  its outrageous i meet people across america who couldnt afford to start college could not afford to stay and never graduated and still have debt they dont have a degree but theyve got debt thats crazy and i see some people pointing to themselves ive got to tell you look i believe that education is an investment thats why i want good schools with good teachers in every zip code in america  thats why i want to get more technical education back into high schools because i think there are a lot of great jobs waiting to be done by people who have the skills from high school or community college   or apprenticeship programs im going to do everything i can to lift up and honor hard work when somebody can make something when somebody is a machinist or a tool and dye maker or a carpenter or even a computer coder that may not at all require a fouryear college education and its about time we honored all work in america and made all work pay for everybody  but for people who want to go to college were going to make it easier i want every public college and university to be tuitionfree for families making less than  a year   and debtfree for everybody else because this should be seen as an investment and if you are struggling with student debt weve got a plan to ease that burden get the costs down get the interest rates down get it paid off much faster you see i really believe that every single person should be able to go as far as youre willing to work for it and not have your dreams dashed while youre a child or a teenager or a young adult elections are about the future so lets lift up the young people of america  and that includes lets dismantle the socalled schooltoprison pipeline and replace it with a cradletocollege pipeline  we have a lot of work to do ive laid out a full agenda tim kaine my running mate and i weve written a book called stronger together and in it it tells you everything we want to try to do and ive got to tell you i think its important you know what we want to do it shouldnt just be an election about words it should be about plans and policies so that you can judge and say what will help me like for example on college you can go to my website hillaryclintoncom right now hillaryclintoncomcalculator and you can see how much money you and your family would save under my plan and i want to be real specific i want to rebuild confidence in what we can do together its not good for anybody that our democracy and our country are viewed so suspiciously without confidence that is how we govern ourselves so we have to work together but i cant do any of this if you dont vote  now so far  million people in ohio have voted  but weve got work to do so please youve got to get out youve got to get to the polls youve got to take people to the polls nobody should sit this one out you can go to iwillvotecom to find out what your polling place is or you can volunteer to help us these next few days you can text join join to  and im really ready to get to work for you this is about what we can do together  its about the kind of future we can create and build and it is an opportunity for all of us to be invested in a better fairer stronger america i want us to do this together i really do believe my slogan stronger together  so i hope ohio will turn out in the biggestrecorded vote in history on tuesday  and we will together prove once and for all that love trumps hate thank you all very much"
31,"Clinton","hello pittsburgh  whoa hello back there   thank you thank you wow   its great to be here at this extraordinary time in our countrys history at this great university  to have a chance on a beautiful day to lift our sights to think about what we are capable of doing together the kind of future that we can create if we search for and find common ground and it is thrilling to have traveled across our country to see the hopefulness to talk about the positive changes that are occurring to really see america at its best and tomorrow each and every one of you gets to make a decision as to whether or not first you will vote because in pennsylvania it is all about election day  other places around the country have been voting for weeks and what you will vote for i am here to ask you to vote for yourselves vote for your families vote for your futures vote on the issue that matter to you because they are on the ballot not just my name and my opponents name  i want to thank tom colicchio for coming out here he is in the middle of opening up another one of his great restaurants but he said he has these two small kids and he just had to come and be apart of lifting up this election and creating the kind of commitment that will bring a recordbreaking number americans to vote we are on the path to see more americans vote than we have ever seen in our history  i am hoping that you wont just come out and vote obviously i hope you vote for me but i also hope  i hope that you will send katie mcginty to the united states senate  weve got some great elected officials here and i want to recognize congressmen mike doyle  county executive rich fitzgerald from pittsburgh mayor bill peitersen  from braddock pa mayor john fetterman  but mostly i am here to say thanks thanks for taking time out to think about whats the stakes are  i love you all too absolutely    so for those who are still making up your minds or thinking maybe its not worth voting at all let me just say the choice in this election could not be clearer it really is between division or unity between strong and steady leadership or a loose cannon between an economy that works for everyone not just those at the top and an economy that is set up and run for those at top now i have spent my public career fighting for kids and families and standing up for our country and if you give me the privilege of your vote tomorrow that is what i will do every single day of my presidency  i will get up in the white house and i will think about what i can do that day to knock down barriers to create opportunities so that you have the chance to fulfill your own dreams you see i believe americas best days are still ahead of us  now that doesnt mean we do have to work for it because we do that doesnt mean we can just expect it to happen as kind of a birthright but i really believe that i would not have work for  months traveled across our country fought as hard as i have about what we need to do and how to do it together proudly stand up and defend the legacy of president obama which has   given our country progress in the right direction if i did not believe with all my heart that we could do this right  we can do this  we dont have to accept a dark and divisive vision for america tomorrow you can vote for a hopeful inclusive bighearted america  and our core values are being tested in this election and i know that people are frustrated a lot of people feel left out and left behind theres fear even anger in our country but ive got to say anger is not a plan my friends if were going to harness our energy and try to overcome our problems then weve got to start talking to each other again  and we have to get good ideas wherever they come from last night i was in manchester new hampshire and i was with khizr khan whose son captain khan was killed while serving in iraq you might remember him from the democratic convention he was not a man to be on the stage of a political convention but when he heard my opponent say what he said about muslims and he looked at the flag that had been draped on his sons coffin he felt compelled to speak out he spoke powerfully about what america means to him and how we have to defend our values and our constitution as he said last night his son serving in the united states army with his unit saw something suspicious moved toward it to check it out telling his men to stay behind and when the car exploded he lost his life  the bronze star and the purple  but as mr khan said when you listen to all of the people that my opponent has insulted and denigrated would there be a place in donald trumps america for captain khan the khan family gives me hope because they truly believe in the values of  of ours and they have stood up holding the constitution as he did at the  to say people around the world cherish this constitution believe in our values  for billions of people we will never ever let that go and we will  someone rip it away in the kind of negative divisive hateful campaign that we have seen  in this election  sometimes when i hear my opponent speak i dont recognize  it doesnt mean we dont have problems and challenges it doesnt mean that  to do more to help our country get better economic opportunities of course we do  i believe we could  i love our country  the american people i know what we are capable of   throughout our history generations of americans have risen together to meet the test of their time they defended democracy built the greatest middle class the world has  marched for civil rights for workers rights  rights for people with disabilities   we face the test  will we be coming together as a nation  further apart will we set goals that all of us  meet will we turn on each other and pit one group of americans  against another now our names will be on the ballot tomorrow but those values and  you care about will be  there too what kind of country do we want and i particularly think about this for young people as i look at  so many  americans who deserve the same opportunities and the  many of us were given  we will make sure they are available because if you think about what it takes to have a thriving america it comes down to a couple of key  if you believe that america thrives when the middle  then you have to vote  were gonna make the biggest investment in goodpaying jobs since world war ii jobs in infrastructure small business clean energy advanced manufacturing  were gonna actually deliver on that unlike my opponent who makes his products mostly overseas  chinese steel and aluminum  made by american steel workers right here in pennsylvania   in american and were especially going to invest in communities that are left out  stand up for the  across america   economy as i do then the national  because nobody who works  be in poverty  and were gonna do more to support working families with affordable childcare   ive got to tell you this  the biggest applause ever because  know its not fair but its also  working you dont want  do you   when i talk about equal pay and all these other family  my opponent says im playing the womans card well you know what i  deal me in  you know if you believe all of our kids should have good schools and good teachers no matter what zip code they  you have to vote  if  that we can make college  for every young     and after it was over he and i got together and we came up with this plan public colleges and universities should be tuition free for everyone who makes less than  a year  and it should be debtfree for everyone else i dont think you should go into this massive debt to get your education its good for you its good for your families its good for our country and were going to make it affordable for everyone  and for the millions of americans already struggling with student debt were going to ease that burden were going to get those interest rates down were going to give you a different way of repaying it as a percentage of your income not tied to a six eight ten percent interest rate  and youre never going to have to pay more than you can afford  you see i think there are a lot of positive things to get excited about and i think the agenda weve put forth in this campaign is one that will really give everybody hope you see working for children and families has been the cause of my life but its never been more important than it is right now so this has to be our mission together doing all we can to help every american especially every young american and especially every child to have the chance to live up to your godgiven potential because when its all said and done thats what matters most have you helped somebody else have you reached out and tried to ease somebodys burden we do it individually my mother got through a neglected abandoned childhood because people showed her kindness her own parents didnt want her her grandparents didnt want her but that first grade teacher who saw she had nothing to eat brought extra food every single day to make sure my mother had something to eat  and when she was  and had to go out and find a job to support herself and got a job as a maid and a babysitter in somebodys home she was just relieved that she had a place to live and that she could support herself but the mother of that home understood my mom wanted to go to high school so she said dorothy if you get up early and you get your chores done you can go to high school youll have to come right back because well need you but you can do it now look that sounds harsh to our ears telling a yearold ok you can go to high school but youve got to come right back and you have to work on both sides of it but to my mother it was a blessing  so when i think about what so many people have gone through to give us the opportunities that we have had  and im speaking for myself my mother gave me the resilience the grit the get up and go she told me everybody gets knocked down what matters is whether you get back up  and we had a lot of americans knocked down because of the great recession didnt we millions of jobs were lost millions of homes were lost family wealth was wiped out savings accounts s everything that people had worked so hard for well weve dug ourselves out of the hole now weve got to get up and weve got to make sure we dont leave anybody behind i see this man standing here with a sign coal miners for hillary and ill tell you sir  i know how hard times are and as i have said and you can take it to the bank i will not forget you and i will do everything i can to help people who have given so much worked so hard throughout their lives for generations to build this country we are not gonna forget any american  but i cant do any of this without your help tomorrow this election is going to really set the course of our country theres no doubt in my mind tonight ill be in philadelphia with president obama and michelle  and i so appreciate how hard they have worked for me but its not for me its for us you know when president obama came into office put yourself in his shoes this young dynamic first african american elected to become president of the united states  and what does he find he finds the worst financial crisis since the great depression thats what he finds wow those were hard hard times i dont think he gets the credit he deserves for making sure we didnt go even deeper into the ditch we were in  but make no mistake there were reasons we ended up in that ditch it didnt happen by accident we had huge tax cuts on the wealthy the administration in office took their eyes off the financial markets and we know what happened they ignored the pressures in the mortgage markets and we know what happened elections have consequences for everything we care about and thats why weve got to have each and every one of you put down your stake in our future if the lines are long tomorrow please wait  in early voting we have had people waiting in line for two and three hours and there have been reporters and others going up and down the line asking people all kinds americans not one type all types why are you here because my future depends on it they say  so tomorrow is the election but that is just the beginning we have to heal this country we have to bring people together listen and respect each other now i know its unusual for somebody running for president to say this i started saying this months ago because i literally was meeting people who were scared by what they were hearing in the election you know ive known a lot of the republicans whove run for president been elected president in recent history i didnt agree with them on everything obviously we had our differences but i didnt doubt that they were fit to serve as president this elections different this person is temperamentally unqualified experientially unqualified to be president and commanderinchief and so many people know that  so i think we do need some more love and kindness right  we have got to rise above all of this hatefilled rhetoric all of these insults and scapegoating and fingerpointing and insulting i want to be the president for all americans not just some i want to be the president for democrats republicans and independents  i want to be the president for those who vote for me and those who vote against me i want to represent everybody  because i know we have a role to play in building a better future so it starts tomorrow if you dont know where to vote go to iwillvotecom you can get all the information you need the polls will be open from seven am to eight pm we are on track as i said to have a huge turnout but we can only do that if all of you make up your minds you bring your friends everybody you know to make sure your voices are heard this is a historic election and were going to do everything we can not only to win but then immediately to get to work and i especially  i especially invite anyone who wants to volunteer for the next  hours go to hillaryclintoncom text join join join to  stop by one of our offices we would love to see you because when your kids and your grandkids ask you in the future what you did in  when everything was on the line youll be able to say you voted for a stronger fairer better america where we build bridges not walls  and where we finally  for all that love trumps hate   thank you"
32,"Clinton","hello grand valley   thank you thank you   it is great to be back in western michigan thank you  are there any lakers here  oh my gosh i am so thrilled to be here i want to thank the president of this great university tom haas the faculty the staff the students i want to thank brandon dillon the chair of the michigan democratic party    and i especially really want to thank you for sending debbie stabenow to the united states senate  i have also the great personal experience and privilege of having worked with debbie gotten to know her become a friend of hers and i am so excited at the possibility that ill be able to work with her again but i want you to know this  and i really really hope youll tell folks because there is no more dedicated effective member of the united states senate than debbie stabenow  she fights for all of you every day but she does it with that smile that never leaves her face and she brings people together who are on opposite sides of issues because she just keeps talking and dont we need more of that in washington where people actually talk and listen to each other so its wonderful to be with all of you and to be introduced by debbie are you ready to vote tomorrow michigan  are you ready to help get your friends to vote tomorrow that is clearly the right answer because we have a really important election tomorrow  the choice in this election could not be clearer and i know that for many people youve gone back and forth youve thought about what to do and i really respect that but let me say this let me say this this election is basically between division and unity in our country  its between strong and steady leadership or a loose cannon who could put everything at risk it is between an economy that works for everyone or one that is even more stacked for those at the top and i want each and every one of you to be thinking through about all the issues that you care about because although my name and my opponents name will be on the ballot those issues and those values are on the ballot as well and as you think about what you care about and what you want your future to look like you have to recognize this is a consequential election i have been privileged to know a lot of our presidents over the past decades and people who ran for president i was privileged to know as a college student gerald ford  in fact i had an internship with the house republican conference committee which he headed after my junior year in college so when i say ive gotten to know a lot of our presidents and people whove run for president it goes back a ways and heres what i want you to understand i didnt agree with everything they did or said even the democrats we had differences and politics and policies and sometimes on principle but i never doubted i never doubted that they were fit to serve as our president and commanderinchief  thats why this election is so different and its why so many republicans have spoken out to endorse me and support me and who have taken very courageous stands against the nominee of their own party  because they believe that we must put country ahead of party when it comes to this election  i was at kent state in ohio last week and i was introduced by a gentleman by the name of bruce blair and mr blair had served in the air force he was a young officer assigned to be what was called a launch officer that meant he served his time every day sitting in a bunker where the controls for launching nuclear weapons were housed and his job  imagine the responsibility a young air force officer in his twenties waiting to hear whether or not an order is given for him to launch nuclear weapons and bruce blair explained that there is no appeal from a presidents order to do that the joint chiefs of our military forces cant say no dont do it theres no veto from congress or anyone else and the time between the order being given and the actual launch is four minutes so after watching this election mr blair began contacting others who had served in this incredibly responsible position to share his concerns about what he was hearing and seeing and several dozen of them  id never met them before  several dozen of them wrote a letter explaining why they could never support donald trump to be our commanderinchief  the awesome responsibility that is housed in one person is something i want you to think about between now and the time you vote because i will pledge to you that i will exercise the greatest care and responsibility in all of the powers invested in the office of the presidency    i also want to pose to you a contrast in visions did any of you see the debates first of all i did stand for four and a half hours with donald trump on the stage proving conclusively i have the stamina to be president  but i have to say in addition to that there were so many things that he said that of course i sometimes was surprised by but the theme that ran through much of his rhetoric was the presentation of a dark and divisive vision for america now i have to tell you i know weve got problems ive spent  months traveling around our country talking to  by now  hundreds and hundreds of thousands of people hearing whats on peoples minds weve got challenges but americas always had challenges and since when do we become pessimistic and not able to think about what we can do to overcome those challenges and solve those problems together  i often didnt recognize the country that donald trump was describing because from my perspective looking back at our history we have a tremendous opportunity ahead of us and you can vote for a hopeful inclusive bighearted america that will set the stage for an even better future  and i want to say especially to the students who are here  i really believe that americas best days are still ahead of us if we reach for them together  make no mistake our core values are being tested in this election but my faith in our future has never been stronger last night in manchester new hampshire i was introduced by mr khizr khan  some of you know or remember that his son captain khan serving in the united states army was killed serving in iraq and like at the democratic convention this summer he spoke powerfully about what america means to him and how we have to defend our values and our constitution that are the envy of the rest of the world people look at us with yearning they see that we are a beacon of freedom hope and opportunity for people right here at home  when i heard mr khan speak at the convention and i heard him again last night i was so touched because what he said exhibited a love of our country he said that when he started hearing donald trump speak and all of the things he said about so many people not only muslims but africanamericans and latinos and pows and women and so many people  when he heard it he couldnt help but think as he walked around his house  he has a room where his sons medals  he got the bronze star he got the purple heart  the flag that was draped on his coffin  is respectfully presented in the box that he was given it in and he thought to himself would there be any room for my son in donald trumps america think about that for a minute because every single one of us has something to contribute to this great country we are already great but we can be greater and we will be greater   i love our country and i believe in the american people and i know there is nothing we cant do when we make up our minds throughout our history generations of americans have risen together to meet the tests of their time they defended democracy they built the greatest middle class the world has ever known they marched for civil rights and voting rights for workers rights and union rights for lgbt rights rights for people with disabilities    and now weve got to come together and we have to prove we can meet the challenges of our time weve got to get the economy working for everybody not just those at the top  if you believe as i do that america thrives when the middle class thrives then you have to vote tomorrow  we are going to make the biggest investment in good paying jobs since world war ii jobs in infrastructure our roads our bridges our tunnels our ports our airports our water systems  these are jobs we need doing in american and these are jobs that cannot be exported theyve got to be done right here in michigan and across our country  and we are going to invest in new jobs in advanced manufacturing i am not one of these folks who think we just cant make it in america anymore and ill tell you why because if we have a plan and we actually commit to fulfilling that plan we can lead the world in precision machining in d printing were not competing for lowwage jobs were competing with germany for high manufacturing high skilled jobs  and we are going to have clean renewable energy jobs as a way to fight climate change as you heard my opponent chose to make many of his products overseas and as i pointed out in the last debate he buys cheap chinese steel and aluminum instead of good american steel made by american steel workers  hes gone all over this country and hes gone all over michigan talking about how hes gonna really get more jobs and hes going to bring back what used to be there well ill tell you what look at his record dont just listen to his rhetoric  because i have a different idea were going to invest in america again and for everybody who is frustrated and anxious and maybe even angry because they feel left out left behind that americas not working the way it should  i understand that i understand that i represented upstate new york for eight years and i saw first hand a lot of the loss of jobs and factories picking up and moving out but i also realized that anger is not a plan youve got to come together and figure out what is it were gonna do to bring new jobs back and create more opportunity for people  and ill just tell you that i believe that weve got to defend the american workers right to organize and bargain for better wages and benefits  were gonna get incomes rising here in western michigan and across this state and were also gonna do more to help small business my dad was a small businessman he worked really hard he ran a printing plant that printed fabrics for draperies and i would from time to time help him out you take a silkscreen you put it down on the long table you pour the paint in you do the squeegee you pick it up  it wasnt automated we were the automaters  and youd go all the way down to one table youd go to the other table so i know how hard people in small business work and i also know something else donald trump made a lot of money off the backs of small business people and contractors by stiffing them and refusing to pay his bills and i have said i am sure glad my dad never got a contract from donald trump because we could not have afforded that  but its not just enough to grow the economy we have to make it fairer and if you believe we need a fairer economy then you have to vote i think the best antidote for whatever ails a person is a good job i believe in hard work thats how i was raised but i also believe that if you work hard and you work full time you shouldnt still be in poverty at the end of the year and im gonna raise the national minimum wage and one of the things ive heard all over america especially from young families really from all families but particularly young families is how hard it is to do so many of the things that are expected  like where do you find affordable quality childcare in lots of states its more expensive than college tuition were gonna get the cost of childcare down were going to have a paid family leave program so that when you have a sick relative or youre sick you wont lose your job  i saw the folks over there holding up the tim kaine sign and i really appreciate that thank you thank you i got to tell you  tim and i were in pittsburgh last month with a big crowd and we couldnt get everybody in like today so tim went out to say hello to people and he saw a woman holding a baby probably about three years old and he stopped to talk to her and she said i came here because i wanted to tell you and to tell hillary clinton what happened to me she said that i had my baby it was a hard labor and delivery and i needed some time off and i called by boss and said the doctors want me to take some time off and so i wont be in for  i think she said two weeks  and they said ok youre fired that is legal in america still and what that does is to say that  wait a minute do we really value children do we really value families and weve got to have a system that is fair to employers and fair to employees because you got to be able to balance work and family in todays america  and then finally i think it is way past time to guarantee equal pay for womens work  and you know i gotta say  this always gets a huge round of applause as you can tell  but this is not just a womans issue its a family issue if you have a wife a mother a sister a daughter whos in the work force you want her to be paid what she deserves to be paid to help you and your family  just about everything ive said so far my opponent disagrees with and whenever i talk about affordable childcare and paid family leave and equal pay  he says im playing the womans card and you know what i say if thats the case then deal me in  and heres what else i want you to know its fair to ask how are you going to pay for that thats not only fair thats necessary to ask because i want to be a good steward of your tax dollars just as i expect youre a good steward of your family budget i have proposed a very simple formula i will not raise taxes on anyone making less than  a year  and for small businesses were gonna cut your taxes because i know a lot of small businesses need that kind of tax relief so instead were going where the money is to the millionaires and the billionaires and the big corporations  and that is in stark contrast to what donald trump has proposed his whole economic plan is cut trillions of dollars in taxes from millionaires and billionaires and corporations that is trickledown economics on steroids i profoundly disagree i think the way you build an economy is from the middle out and the bottom up not from the top down  when you think about it donald hasnt paid anything for  years hes paid zero to support our military our vets pell grants for students here at grand valley our highways  and i am still pondering i am just pondering how anybody can lose a billion dollars in one year especially when youre running casinos i do not understand that but that will be one of the mysteries in this campaign because hes not going to release his tax returns now and the time you start voting and that sort of suggests there must be something really terrible in those tax returns because everybody else for more than  years has released them so well still wonder but what we know is his economic approach will cost us jobs not create jobs and we cant afford that we need to keep building we have recovered from the worst financial crash since the great depression but were not where we need to be yet the last thing we need is a failed economic policy coming back in and pushing us back down and depriving people of the jobs that we want to create  and if you believe all of our kids should have good schools and good teachers no matter what zip code they live in then you have to vote  and if you believe college should be affordable you have to vote ive got to say i am proud of the campaign that bernie sanders and i ran it was a campaign about ideas and issues not insults and when it was over we actually got together what a novel idea we wanted to figure out how we can work together to actually produce on some of the goals that we both shared so bernie and i worked on this plan together public colleges and universities should be tuitionfree for everyone who makes less than a  a year and they should be debtfree for everyone else because nobody should go into debt and if you have gone into debt if youre among the millions of americans who are struggling  as i see some hands pointing in the air  paying back your student debt we are going to help you pay it down and pay it off  it makes no sense at all we have interest rates that are really low right now buy a car for what  or  percent you can buy a house for  percent there are so many people who are paying    higher     percent interest  how much twelve point seven fourteen point one i got to tell you friends that is outrageous the federal government should not be making money off of sending kids to college  i cant wait to roll up my sleeves with debbie and bernie and were gonna get to work right after this election if i am fortunate enough to win  look working for children and families has been the cause of my life but its never been more important than it is right now and that has to be our mission together doing all we can to help every american and especially every young american and every child in america to have the chance to live up to their godgiven potential i will wake up every single day in the white house trying to figure out what i can do to make that a reality for you  so after tomorrow the work will begin and one of the highest priorities that i feel an obligation to address is how we bring our country together a lot of people say weve got to heal our country or as the bible says repair the breach because we have so much divisiveness right now weve got to start listening to each other respecting each other i know it is unusual i admit for somebody running for president especially the day before an election but ive been saying this for months to say that we need more of two things right now we need more love and kindness in america  i dont know about you i dont know about you but i bet everyone of us has received a kindness and maybe i hope weve all extended one i am standing here today because my mother who was abandoned by her parents rejected by her grandparents went to work at the age of  as a maid and a babysitter was extended kindness not by those who should have loved her but by others the first grade teacher who saw she had nothing to eat at lunch who began bringing extra food the woman whose house she went to work in who knew that my mother wanted to go to high school she would have been a freshman in high school when she had to leave her grandparents home and she got this job and that woman said i know you want to go to high school if you get up early and you get your chores done you can go to high school but youll have to come back because well need you in the late afternoon now that may sound harsh to say to a year old but to my mother it was a gift i tell you this because we all have to start thinking about how we want to be treated and what that means about how we treat others and   theres a version of the golden rule in every major religion and it is a reminder that every one of us gets knocked down the question as my mother would say is are you gonna get back up and for people in our country who feel like theyve been knocked down and nobody cares nobodys paying attention heres what i want you to know if you give me the honor of being your president im gonna do everything i can to get this country and everybody in it back up on our feet moving forward together  because i want to be a president for all americans  democrats republicans independents not just the people who support me everybody in this country because i believe with all my heart each of us has a role to play in building a better future so lets take that first step tomorrow if you dont know where youre supposed to vote go to iwillvotecom  you can get all the information you need if you want to help us bringing out the vote here in western michigan in the last   hours you can still sign up to volunteer go to hillaryclintoncom or you can text join or stop by one of our offices we would be really excited to see you because when your kids and grandkids ask what you did in  when everything was on the line i hope youll be able to say that you voted for a better stronger fairer america  an america where we build bridges not walls  and an america where we prove that yes love trumps hate thank you all so much"
33,"Clinton","hello philadelphia    oh thank you i am so grateful to be here tonight to spend this time with all of you here in this historic spot and to all the volunteers the activists the union organizers of the hard hats i see in the audience tonight   thank you for coming out for one last rally before election day tomorrow  and personally i am so happy to be finishing this campaign with my husband and my daughter by my side weve been traveling across the country separately trying to cover as much ground as possible and talk to as many voters as we can but im really glad that were all together tonight in philadelphia with you  and how great was it to have jon bon jovi and bruce springsteen with us  but in addition to all of that what is so special for me is that we have our amazing president and first lady with us because for now nearly eight years they have served our nation with grace strength brilliance and a whole lot of cool  and they have shown us again and again as michelle said right here in philadelphia back at our convention when others go low we go high   im pretty sure as they said tonight that the best way to thank them is to do something really important tomorrow to vote every single one of you and every person you know because as the president just pointed out there is a clear choice in this election a choice between division or unity between an economy that works for everyone or only those at the top between strong steady leadership or a loose cannon who could put everything at risk so make no mistakes our core values are being tested in this election we know enough about my opponent we know who he is the real question for us is what kind of country we want to be and what kind of future we want to build for our children im proud that i had the chance to serve in president obamas cabinet  and i am proud that i could watch the extraordinary service of our first lady and one thing i know is that like them i love america and i know you do too  we love this country we love what it stands for not that we are blind to its flaws its problems its challenges but i believe with all my heart that americas best days are still ahead of us   if we reach for them together we choose to believe in a hopeful inclusive bighearted america an america where everyone has a place everyones included everyone has a chance to live up to their own godgiven potential  there have been so many memorable moments in this election for me and most of them revolve around the people that ive had the privilege of meeting and last night in manchester new hampshire i had the honor to be introduced by khizr khan whose son captain khan was killed serving our country in iraq  just as he did here at our convention mr khan again reminded us of the responsibility we all share to protect and defend our constitution you remember the story of captain khan the son of immigrants himself brought here as a young child who grew up to join the united states army and on that fateful day with his unit he saw a suspicious car and he moved toward it to try to determine whether it was a danger or not telling his men to stay back the car was rigged the bomb went off and he died protecting his men he was awarded the bronze star and the purple heart and what mr khan said last night is something i want us all to remember he said after the many derogatory and insulting comments that weve heard from donald trump would his son would captain khan have a place in donald trumps america thats an important question for all of us because we dont want to shrink the vision of this great country we want to keep expanding it so that everyone  everyone  has a place to pursue your dreams your aspirations the future that you want to create for yourselves and everyone else  think about that when you go to the polls tomorrow think about how throughout our history generations of americans just like us have come together to meet the tests of their time and yes as president obama said it started right here in philadelphia when representatives from  unruly colonies came together to launch the greatest experiment the world has ever seen our parents and grandparents defended that democracy they built the great american middle class they marched for civil rights and voting rights for workers rights and womens rights for lgbt rights and rights for people with disabilities  and tomorrow we face the test of our time what will we vote for not just against what will we decide is on the ballot because although my name and my opponents name may be on the ballot every issue you care about is on that ballot if you believe that america thrives when the middle class thrives then you have to vote  if you believe all of our kids should have good schools and good teachers no matter what zip code they live in then you have to vote  if you believe college should be more affordable you have to vote  if you believe we must reform our criminal justice system so everyone has respect for the law and everyone is respected by the law you have to vote  if you believe we need to protect our kids and pass common sense gun safety reforms you have to vote  if you believe we must raise the minimum wage and finally guarantee equal pay for women then you need to vote  now you know every time i say that last part about equal pay for women my opponent accuses me of playing the womens card well you know what i say if thats playing the womens card then deal me in   so it is not just my name or donald trumps name on the ballot tomorrow every issue you care about is at stake and that is just the beginning because we have to bridge the divides in our country i regret deeply how angry the tone of the campaign became   and by the way did any of you see those debates  well i stood next to donald trump for fourandahalf hours proving conclusively i have the stamina to be president and commanderinchief  but i have to say   i have to say that there were so many really troubling things that my opponent has said but probably the most horrifying was at the end of the last debate after he has insulted everyone more than half the population by the way immigrants african americans latinos pows muslims women he then launches an attack on our democracy refusing to say whether or not he would accept the outcome of the election well lets show tomorrow there will be no question about the outcome of this election  but i also want you to know i will be a president for all americans   democrats republicans independents not just the people who support me in this election everyone because i believe we all have a role to play in building a better fairer stronger america building on the progress that we have enjoyed under president barack obama over the last eight years  i am not going to let anybody rip away the progress weve made and turn the clock back sending us back in time where people are free to question the foundation of our country what our founders here did you know they did not agree on everything in case you havent remembered there were lots of contentious arguments but they saw a higher purpose and they came together thats what i want us to do and we can take the first step tomorrow please make a plan to vote pennsylvania it all happens tomorrow  if you text the word plan plan to  we will walk you through where to vote when to vote how to get there you can do that right now and please tell your friends your family your neighbors and you can go to iwillvotecom and get all the information you need every person who lives in philadelphia lives within five blocks of your polling place thats it just five blocks and the polls open at  am and they close at  pm and remember if youre in line at  pm they have to let you vote  and so we need your help in these last hours we need your help knocking on doors and making phone calls helping to turn people out maybe helping people who need assistance to get to the polls you can still volunteer by going to hillaryclintoncom because none of us  none of us  want to wake up on wednesday morning and wish we had done more years from today when your kids and grandkids ask what you did in  when everything was on the line i want you to be able to say that you did vote you voted for an inclusive bighearted openminded country future that will make sure that we all keep moving together because i do believe we are stronger together  and you voted for an america where we build bridges not walls  and maybe most importantly you voted in great numbers to demonstrate conclusively once and for all that yes love trumps hate lets get out and vote philadelphia tomorrow  lets make history together thank you and god bless you"
34,"Clinton","thank you all  thank you  thank you  well ive got to tell you this is sure worth staying up for  it is so great to be here in raleigh here at north carolina state  and i cannot imagine a better way of ending this campaign than having the opportunity to see all of you and to watch and listen to lady gaga  one of the most inventive creative and passionate performers whose range goes from a to z and beyond and i was watching on the screen not only her perform but all of you jumping and singing and waving it was great  because you know what thats what i want for america and the young people of america  the joy the passion the  and you know our longterm friend jon bon jovi was with us  he was with us up in philadelphia where he and bruce springsteen sang  and jon said well hey i want to go down to raleigh and so here he is  and you know between now and the time the poll closes tomorrow we are going to be living on a prayer  i was really impressed when everybodys hand went up saying youd already voted well go find somebody else who hasnt voted ok  bring out your friends your roommates strangers on the street  just stop and talk to them about whats at stake in this election because north carolina is key and its not only important for our election are you ready to elect roy cooper as your next governor  well i sure hope so i sure hope so and i hope youre ready to elect linda coleman your lieutenant governor  and how about dan blue iii for state treasurer  and i really really hope you will send deborah ross to washington  now we are all fired up when we were with the president and michelle in philadelphia   you know the president was talking about how absolutely consequential this election is and of course it is i  i really believe its the most important election of our lifetimes because weve never had a clearer choice never  it is a choice between division or unity between strong steady leadership or a loose cannon who could risk everything  its a choice between an economy that works for everyone not just those at the top and it   it is a choice that really goes to the heart of who we are as americans what i saw before i came in and what i see now is a sense of potential of joy there is no reason my friends why americas best days are not ahead of us if we   reach for them together  we dont have to accept a dark and divisive vision for america tomorrow you can vote for a hopeful inclusive bighearted america  our core values  our core values are being tested in this election but my faith in our future has never been stronger i love our country and i believe in the american people and i know if we bring everyone together we can set goals and we can move toward them and we can feel that sense of accomplishment that comes with being part of something bigger than ourselves  you know one of the  one of the great privileges of crisscrossing the country as i have in this campaign is meeting remarkable people people who stand up against the odds people who like my late mother people who understand that everybody gets knocked down what matters is whether you get back up whether you believe you can keep going  last night in manchester new hampshire i had the honor of being introduced by an extraordinary man khizr khan whos son captain khan was killed serving our country in iraq  you may remember mr khans speech at the democratic convention and  again last night he reminded us of the responsibility we all share to protect and defend our constitution the story of captain khan is one of courage in the face of danger he was with his unit when he saw a suspicious vehicle he told his men to stay back he moved toward the vehicle to check it out and the bomb went off he lost his life but everyone else in his unit survived he was awarded the bronze star  and this intensely personal tragedy that the khan family experiences becoming a gold star family was one that they thought about grieved over in the privacy of their home until they heard my opponent start talking about who was acceptable in america and who wasnt the categories of people starting with immigrants including africanamericans and latinos and pows and muslims the list went on and on and it created in mr khan a sense of despair because he asked himself would his son have a place in donald trumps america someone who paid the ultimate price in serving our country well we can answer that question tomorrow resoundingly yes absolutely  think about  think about how generations of americans throughout our history have come together to meet the tests of their time our parents our grandparents our greatgrandparents defended democracy they built the great american middle class they marched for civil rights and voting rights for workers rights and womens rights for  and the rights of people with disabilities and tomorrow we face the test of our time so remember its not just my name or donald trumps name on the ballot its the kind of country we want its every issue anyone cares about so if you believe america thrives when the middle class thrives then you have to vote tomorrow if you believe we should make the biggest investment in new jobs since world war ii in infrastructure advanced manufacturing clean energy small business then you have to vote  if you believe we need more fairness in our economy to raise the minimum wage because no one who works fulltime should still be in poverty then you have to vote if you believe we need to do more to support working families with affordable child care paid leave and equal pay for women then you have to vote  and remember when my opponent says every time i talk about these issues that im playing the womans card well you know what i say deal me in  and if you believe  if you believe all kids deserve good schools with good teachers no matter what zip code they live in you have to vote and if you believe college should be more affordable you have to vote  bernie sanders and i worked on a plan to make public colleges and universities tuitionfree   if you earn less than  and debtfree for everybody else  and for the millions of americans struggling with student debt we are going to help you pay that down and pay that off  if you believe in science and that weve got to address climate change you have to vote  if you believe we need to reform our criminal justice system so   then you have to vote and if you believe  if you believe we should never write discrimination into our laws   well then you know  you know north carolina youve got to vote to get rid of hb  now this is so energizing we could  we could keep going with a long list  but heres what  heres what else i want you to know good thing this election didnt land during exams thats all i can say  look tomorrow  tomorrow night this election will end but i want you to understand our work together will be just beginning  we have to bridge the divides in this country as the bible says we have to repair the breaches weve got to be willing to start listening to each other again respecting each other again  and i  i want to thank gaga because she has always stood for that fundamental principle of respecting  so i want you to know and i want you to spread the word i do want to be president for all americans not just some not just the people who support me and vote for me i want to be president

thank you all"
35,"Clinton","thank you thank you all thank you  thank you all very much thank you thank you thank you so much  very rowdy group thank you my friends thank you thank you thank you so very much for being here and i love you all too last night i congratulated donald trump and offered to work with him on behalf of our country i hope that he will be a successful president for all americans this is not the outcome we wanted or we worked so hard for and im sorry that we did not win this election for the values we share and the vision we hold for our country but i feel pride and gratitude for this wonderful campaign that we built together this vast diverse creative unruly energized campaign you represent the best of america and being your candidate has been one of the greatest honors of my life  i know how disappointed you feel because i feel it too and so do tens of millions of americans who invested their hopes and dreams in this effort this is painful and it will be for a long time but i want you to remember this our campaign was never about one person or even one election it was about the country we love and about building an america thats hopeful inclusive and bighearted we have seen that our nation is more deeply divided than we thought but i still believe in america and i always will and if you do then we must accept this result and then look to the future donald trump is going to be our president we owe him an open mind and the chance to lead our constitutional democracy enshrines the peaceful transfer of power and we dont just respect that we cherish it it also enshrines other things the rule of law the principle that we are all equal in rights and dignity freedom of worship and expression we respect and cherish these values too and we must defend them  now  and let me add our constitutional democracy demands our participation not just every four years but all the time so lets do all we can to keep advancing the causes and values we all hold dear making our economy work for everyone not just those at the top protecting our country and protecting our planet and breaking down all the barriers that hold any american back from achieving their dreams  weve spent a year and a half bringing together millions of people from every corner of our country to say with one voice that we believe that the american dream is big enough for everyone  for people of all races and religions for men and women for immigrants for lgbt people and people with disabilities for everyone  so now our responsibility as citizens is to keep doing our part to build that better stronger fairer america we seek and i know you will i am so grateful to stand with all of you i want to thank tim kaine and anne holton for being our partners on this journey  it has been a joy getting to know them better and it gives me great hope and comfort to know that tim will remain on the front lines of our democracy representing virginia in the senate  to barack and michelle obama our country owes you an enormous debt of gratitude  we  we thank you for your graceful determined leadership that has meant so much to so many americans and people across the world and to bill and chelsea mark charlotte aidan our brothers and our entire family my love for you means more than i can ever express you crisscrossed this country on our behalf and lifted me up when i needed it most  even fourmonthold aidan who traveled with his mom i will always be grateful to the creative talented dedicated men and women at our headquarters in brooklyn and across our country  you poured your hearts into this campaign for some of you who are veterans it was a campaign after you had done other campaigns some of you it was your first campaign i want each of you to know that you were the best campaign anybody could have ever expected or wanted  and to the millions of volunteers community leaders activists and union organizers who knocked on doors talked to neighbors posted on facebook even

36,"Trump","thank you very much we had an amazing convention that was one of the best i think it was one of the best ever in terms  in terms of enthusiasm in terms of i think what it represents getting our word out ivanka was incredible last night she did an incredible job  and so many of the speakers were so amazing and groundsetting i mean really groundsetting we were  it was just something very very special were even getting good marks on television can you believe this  hard to believe oh theyll change dont worry  but it has been  it has been just an incredible four days i want to thank the people of cleveland and the people of ohio  because its  i mean what  what theyve done you know we read two three weeks ago this is going to be horrible were going to have riots were going to have problems everything was a problem a problem this was probably one of the most peaceful one of the most beautiful one of the most lovefilled conventions in the history of conventions  and when they talk about unity i want to tell you that was unity that was unity right i saw you last night that was unity that was amazing and the party has just come together the party has come together and the few people that arent there its ok you know youve got to understand i ran as an outsider i didnt want anybody now i have guys like mike pence i mean this isnt supposed to happen  see now if i dont win im going to blame mike right we have to blame mike  but we want to thank a number of people because in particular and were going to leave out some because that always happens and its very sad the set  im a real estate guy  i build buildings i build things i want to tell you that was the most beautiful set i think ive ever seen not only for conventions but for anything  and the folks that worked on that especially the carpenters the electricians you know we forget about  we forget about this stuff those sheetrockers were up there they did a heck of a job i said youre going to wrap that sheet rock and he said yeah mr trump we just cut it i said i know what you do but you dont see it very much we have our chairman from new york i see right over there  my man my leader right were going to win new york were going to try and win new york  you know if we win new york its over right its over thank you chairman i really appreciate it  so a few of the people harold hamm is here where is harold hes around here  look at harold here oh boy you talk about money oy yoy yoy you know barry switzer the great football coach won a super bowl won a national championship and i guess hes harolds best friend or one of them so he came up to my office and hes sitting there and says you know mr trump harold is one of the great energy tycoons but more importantly from our standpoint one of the people that really understands energy better than anybody else you know we hired these consultants they dont know what theyre doing if they were any good theyd be worth  billion ok but harold is one of the really knowledgeable people in energy and barry switzer  and hes a tough cookie and a good guy but a tough cookie he said you know mr trump that harold hamm hes my friend but these other companies they go out and they spend millions of dollars looking for oil that guy takes a straw puts in the ground and oil pours out of it thats the kind of a guy we want telling us about energy right  harold and you made a great speech the other night great to have you we want the real players right we dont want the consultants we dont want the guys that he hires we want him so harold great that youre here i didnt know youd be here i appreciate it and your speech was terrific by the way we also have and i think very important jeff sessions who may or may not be here still but i want to tell you he was the first one  mike he was right at the beginning and hes so highly respected and honestly ted cruz has so much respect for jeff sessions and everybody knew that jeff sessions was going to be with ted cruz during the campaign and jeff said you know ive never seen anything like whats happening youve got a movement going on and he was really the first big big player  us senator highly respected by everybody one of the really smart people and low key i like that everyone once and a while you know that low key genius  well donald i dont know if id do it that way why dont you try doing it this way i say thats genius  every once and a while we have people like that right but jeff sessions was there right at the beginning and it was a huge upset because when jeff came on everybody thought he was going to just routinely be with ted and frankly hes never endorsed anybody before you know hes not an endorser this is  hes called a tough endorsement and he went out and he endorsed me and that was a fantastic thing and hes been a great help ever since so jeff sessions i appreciate it  jeff larsons around here someplace  wheres jeff larson hes around here someplace what a job jeff did reince of course wheres my superstar  i think hes probably on a plane flying to our next meeting this guy works so hard you know i said yesterday in front of a small group because were raising money like its crazy whats going on  and you know the nice thing first of all i put in over  million last month i think i put in  million but were raising money also for the republican party which is very important  and  and the beautiful thing  i cant guarantee these figures but i heard yesterday alone was like  million from small donors the average donation was just over  and were raising tremendous amount of money from the small donors to me thats more important in a sense i mean harold can write his checks but harolds only one vote right these other people give you  but they vote by the millions thats what we want to hell with harold right  but  but we have you know just tremendous numbers of people coming in and were really building up a war chest thats going to be great and im continuing to fund my campaign large portions of it and in fact i thought i gave  million last month and they said no you actually gave  i said oh its always good when you dont even know what you gave and it doesnt matter  you know its nice when they say you gave  instead of two and i dont even get angry at anybody right  but im over  million because i said i was going to fund the primaries and i didnt know this was going to happen so i guess we just keep going along right but ill tell you its an honor its an honor and i  and ive said this a lot of the television people have come up to me and a lot of the  actually one very highly respected writer called up and ive told this story a few times but i said  he said what youve done is incredible and this was actually in september they called it the summer of trump and he said what youve done is incredible i said nothings incredible unless i win and i wasnt talking about the primaries he said no no no what youve done is incredible its been the summer of trump its down in the history books theres never been anything like it bill oreilly said its the greatest single political phenomena hes ever seen in his life a couple of weeks ago did you see that  yeah and brit hume said it and im not so sure if brit hume likes me but he said it so  but i like him so what happened is they said that i said no no no you dont understand i dont care i dont do anything unless i win and im not talking about the primaries i mean the whole thing  because otherwise what have we done what have we done then i got a call from somebody else a month ago saying the same thing but now it was the summer of trump it was the autumn of trump it was the christmas of trump it was everything and its really of you because its a movement what we have going is a movement i was just on the cover of time again this week time magazines like eh ok  you know i think i was on the cover of time magazine twice in my life and like six times in the last number of months so you tell me which is more important real estate or politic ok thats  thats the way  is that true harold because i have six for politics and i have two for real estate or whatever they put me on for but its been  its been amazing but i said look it really to me matters they said no no no believe me what youve done is in the history books theres never been anything like it then i won the primaries they said the same thing this is crazy now youre really in the history  i said no it doesnt matter unless we beat hillary clinton and i mean beat her badly  i will consider it  and i shouldnt say this because you know what if it doesnt work out i could say well i did a good job so im hurting myself by saying this if i dont win meaning that final stage beat  people  because actually  including but it was actually  because there was one that we dont even talk about who joined who left very quickly one statement he was gone ok  and then dont forget hillary had a couple of guys who dropped out and bernie was tough bernie was tough were going to get a lot of the bernie voters by the way  because they didnt treat bernie right they didnt treat him right i mean i dont know bernie i dont  you know i dont know him ive never met him but they didnt treat him right honestly and what happened  he ran a very very good campaign and hillarys people just swamped him youre looking at debra wasserman schultz ill take  reince over her any day in terms of competence forget it  not for being nice or any of those things who cares i will take reince in terms of competence over her  believe me  any day any day you see what shes done to that party so i will tell you that i think were going to get a lot of his voters because of the trade issue because they understand but because of the trade issue i think were going to get a lot of their voters so i have to thank reince i want to thank steve king wheres steve king thats our local  wheres steve where thank you steve i want to thank some of our security guys first of all the secret service is unbelievable unbelievable  theyve been hit a little bit over the last couple of years let me tell you these guys are fantastic im the best thing that ever happened to the secret service  because i go around mark and all these guys i go around saying how great they are they are great these are great great people ok  so i want to thank the secret service i want to thank the police of cleveland the cleveland police department the mayor i want to thank i want to thank your police chief he is amazing i dont know if hes here but boy he has done some job working  working with all of the folks from law enforcement and you heard last night were going to be protecting the law enforcement they are doing some job so were going to be protecting them i want to thank eddie dick  wheres eddie is eddied here i want to thank kevin schroeder  keith schiller become famous hes becoming more famous than me i have to thank  and again your police chief has done a fantastic job in cleveland done a fantastic  and we have   in terms of some of the folks david gilbert wheres david david around some place joe roman  chris conner  chris kelly these people are all here dont bother you dont have to come up and speak  beth mooney  wheres brian jack brian jack boy brian brian what a job you did brian  ok thats all now you can leave go to the next location brian  go to the next location hillarys trying the to pick her vice president as fast as possible because she wants to take away a little of the success that we had at this convention this convention has been a success you know people if you turn on television you turn on some of the dishonest media youll see that oh wow this happened and that happened what happened you know somebody got booed the hell out of a place by thousands and thousands of people  there wasnt one person in the room  not one and then they said there may not be unity unity there wasnt one person in the room who was  including the texas delegation right honestly he may have ruined his political career i feel so badly i feel so badly  and you know hell come and endorse over the next little while hell come and endorse because he has no choice but i dont want his endorsement what difference does it make i dont want his endorsement i have such great endorse  i dont want his endorsement just  ted stay home relax enjoy yourself  just a couple of things i knew his speech they gave me his speech i saw exactly what his speech was because when you go up to speak you have to give your speech you know we dont want surprises right so they gave it they came to me and said its a boring speech mr trump nothing good nothing bad he congratulates you on the victory and heres the speech well he got up and of the first two sentences he added a sentence in other words he got up and he added a sentence which could have been viewed as a nasty thing in terms of what he said because he was implying something which is wrong but thats ok so he took his speech  and youre bound by the speech just like youre bound by the pledge right  youre bound by the pledge so ted cruz took his speech that was done was on the teleprompter said hello then made a statement that wasnt on the speech and then went back to his speech see to me thats dishonorable to me not signing a pledge is dishonorable ok its dishonorable but not a nice thing to do and i talk this way because were all together we created one of the most successful conventions in the history of conventions  and the television ratings for this convention were through the roof i get a kick out of cnn i dont know if this is a successful convention i dont know in the meantime all they talk about is trump and the convention are right and i have to tell you melania did a great job what a great speech what a great speech  what a great speech and the presentation is still being talked about what a beautiful speech ivanka last night unbelievable unbelievable  unbelievable to have that kind of an introduction and tiffany whos never done it the biggest group shes ever been in front of is probably  people in a classroom  tiffany was amazing and eric and don  i just dont want them running for political office because somebodys got to stay behind and run the business i mean you know we cant go crazy  but i get a kick because the ratings on television are through the roof and nobodys going to watch  look ill  this has nothing to do with politics but maybe it has a little to do nobodys going to watch this next convention coming who the  whos going to  im going to have a hard time watching her final speech number one i know her too well number two boring its boring  very boring oh how about that final speech and our final speech our final speech  now it wasnt my fault but i think it went like an hour and  minutes and the networks didnt know what to do because they had all of their programming big programming  the local news is a very big factor on television you never ever move your local news they all moved it  they said the heck with the local news mike they said were moving it and kimmel and fallon and the shows they all went back a long way because they werent going to miss this convention i love that you know i love it i knew i said oh wow im supposed to be off lets keep going but it wasnt my fault  what happened  what happened was the applause was so long and so crazy  it really was i mean if you look the speech was fine but the applause were longer than the speech  so it was  it was amazing there was great love in that room honestly that was all about unity and we may be missing a couple of people we may be missing just a couple of people two other things two other things just to finish with ted because i like ted hes fine again i dont want his endorsement if he gives it i will not accept it just so you understand if he gives it i will  i will not accept it wont matter honestly he should have done it because nobody cares and he would have been in better shape for four years from now if hes going to  i dont think  i dont see him winning anyway frankly but if he did its fine although maybe ill set up a superpac if he decides to run  are you allowed to set up a superpac mike if you are the president to fight somebody but  but there were two things that he said yesterday were lies ready i didnt start anything with the wife a pac which hes very friendly with released a cover story on my wife who was a tremendously successful and elegant model and she was on the cover of gq magazine i think it was gq right gq magazine is not exactly penthouse but she was on the cover of gq magazine an artsy picture but you know she was a model really successful she didnt need to marry me she was making a lot of money believe me  in fact i had to work hard to get her to marry me it wasnt that easy  its true  its so true you think im kidding so  so they released this picture which was you know to the people of the state of utah i love utah i love the people of utah but thats not where you want to necessarily send a risque picture everybody in utah got a picture and i dont think they showed that it was gq i dont even think they showed they took the gq off they just had  they cut all the stuff out so they didnt see it was a magazine cover from you know a reasonably respected magazine and it was melania trump now and im saying this just to clear it up because thats a  he took  i didnt do anything then when i saw somebody tweeted a picture of melania and a picture of heidi who i think by the way is a very nice woman and a very beautiful woman i have to tell you i think heidi cruz is a great person i think its the best thing hed got going and his kids if you want to know the truth  in a certain way although hes got good intellect but he doesnt know how to use it and he was a good debater but he didnt do well in the debates against me according to every poll i mean every poll you know hes this great debater except he lost in every single poll and every single debate so that takes care of the heidi thing because heidis a terrific woman but they sent out  now he said that was a pac we had nothing to do folks a lot of us are political people right were not babies his people were on the pac so he said we had nothing to do we had now probably you could trace it down with emails but theyre pretty smart they dont even send  probably just phone calls but look it was a pac with many of his friends it was a cruz superpac i think he even said well it wasnt really meant for us it was a cruz pac it was his people ok so they sent out the first picture please remember that number two his father i dont know his father i met him once i think hes a lovely guy i think hes a lovely guy all i did is point out the fact that on the cover of the national enquirer there was a picture of him and crazy lee harvey oswald having breakfast now ted never denied that it was his father instead he said donald trump  i had nothing to do with it this was a magazine that frankly in many respects should be very respected they got oj they got edwards i mean if that was the new york times they would have gotten pulitzer prizes for their reporting ive always said why didnt the national enquirer get the pulitzer prize for edwards and oj simpson and all of these things but anyway so they have a picture an old picture having breakfast with lee harvey oswald now nothing  im not saying anything they said  and heres how the press takes that story so this had nothing to do with me except i might have pointed it out but it had nothing to do with me i have no control over anything i might have pointed it out but they never denied did anybody ever deny that it was the father theyre not saying oh that wasnt really my father its a little hard to do because it looks like him  so heres the story the press takes that and they say donald trump and his conspiracy theories he went out and said his father was with lee harvey oswald and he assassinated the president what did i do so two things those were the two points so in those two points he said about the endorsement  and i just had it cleared up i think im doing the right thing in doing it but i have to do it number one the heidi thing you understand now number two i know nothing about his father i know nothing about lee harvey oswald but there was a picture on the front page of the national inquirer which does have credibility and theyre not going to do pictures like that because they get sued for a lot of money if things are wrong ok a lot of money and there was a picture and thats the only thing i know so now they use the two things as the reason he wont support let me tell you something we if for no other reason if people really dislike me and i dont think they do any more after the four days hey look if i have kids that like me that much how bad can i be right right   and they love their daddy i was a good father but i have smart children and good children and im getting a lot of credit i think they were the star of the convention mike i think they saved us i think they saved us mike but no my children were really  and theyre saying people are saying that they were the star  the real stars of the convention everyone of them  they were  i was so proud of them i mean it was such a great thing but to finish this was an amazing period of time this was an amazing convention i just heard a number  is dan scavino there come up dan for a second i just  dan scavino you might have seen him on twitter and facebook you know what he is hes a facebook twitter junky this guy  that was the first time ive seen him look up in seven months hes always looking down  nobody knows facebook and twitter and that stuff better than dan why dont you give just a quick report because i hear the numbers are astronomical where do you hear these  you know were dealing in a modern age i hate to do this a lot of people saying whats facebook whats  unfortunately were dealing in a modern age how about giving a quick  you want to hear this wait until you hear the numbers you wont even believe them go ahead   ten million    so one of my really good choices in life although ill confirm that in about three and a half months from now but i believe truly it will be one of my really great decisions is picking mike pence to run along with me and to run for you  and so id like to ask governor pence from the great state of indiana and we love indiana and bobby knight who i love and lou holtz and youre wonderful  you know gene from purdue  we have them all  and digger weve got a lot of coaches out there but these guys are great people and they love mike and maybe mike can say a few words thank you    thank you just one thing i wanted to leave you with supreme court justices  no matter how much you like or dislike no matter what your feelings whether youre the governor of ohio whether youre a senator from texas or any of the other people that i beat so easily and so badly you have no choice youve got to go for trump supreme court justices if hillary clinton gets it she is going to replace  and last night i called him our beloved justice scalia he was great  and were going to get somebody as close to him and his views and philosophy as possible conservative all the things you want the things we stand for as a party and i promise you that and thats why i issued  names because being an outsider they said oh well we dont know supposing you put up liberal judges i say i have an idea its never been done before you know we have a lot of ideas that people dont normally have right i said i have an idea in order to  because i really just have no problem they didnt know if they believed me well we dont know what happens if we elect him and then he puts up liberal judges by the way our conservative republican presidents havent done so well with the judges have they ok i mean we have obamacare should have been knocked out twice because of an appointment  so well do better well do much better thats why i put out a list of  judges but no matter what you think of donald trump as a republican if thats what your philosophy is if youre a great great believer in the constitution you have no choice hate to say it whether youre a hater or a lover and by the way last night i dont think there was one hater in that room and that was packed  that was packed there were no seats and those seats were selling for a lot of money on ebay they were going for big numbers in fact i was thinking about taking  or  tickets and saying lets go but they were selling for a lot of money and it was amazing so just remember supreme court justices i want to finish by this  weve had some incredible support because when i started everyone said you know some of these pundits that now say oh well you cant do that you cant  these were the same people that say well if he runs  but he wont run i ran then they said oh then they go but he wont win then i started off at  percent which is pretty high because i was only there about two days people forgot so that was only two days i didnt get the full backing then it went to like  and then to  and every week they said well thats his ceiling and he cant do more than that so we go from six  right these  i saw them in the audience those two so we go from six to  to  and every week they go well thats the ceiling charles krauthammer they will not run he will not run and if he runs he will just be doing it for fun this is not fun this is a lot of work ok this is a lot of work folks i didnt need this this wasnt in exactly the schedule but i saw how badly our country is doing and how easy it will be to bring back trade deals alone will make an impact like you wont believe money will come in jobs will come in and then you look at the military where its so depleted but were taking care of other nations and i want to continue to take care of other nations there are a lot of good things about that but they have to pay us they have to pay us  you know i remember years ago and ive always said wow i never quite understood it  because they said the united states spends ten times the money on its military than anybody else in the world i said  i said well china has a big military all these places thats surprising but you know i was building buildings and things i never really gave it too much thought and then i realized i remember  i always remember we spend so much more than anybody else i said how can that be were protecting everybody in the world i mean were protecting all these nations and these are rich nations and theyre great nations japan they send their cars they make a fortune and then they dont pay us the amount that it costs i dont want to make a profit i want costs pay us what it costs maybe we cant get it and if we cant  see you have to be prepared to walk you have to if youre not prepared to walk hillary clinton came out when she heard what i said about japan japan is a very rich nation those cars are flowing in theyre rich because of us if you think about it ok those cars  you go to los angeles you see these massive ships it looks like nascar by the way thank you brian france owner of nascar he endorsed donald trump i love nascar richard petty endorsed me all  a lot of the great drivers endorsed me king richard but they  its like  its like these guys driving  its like richard petty driving  theyre coming out of the boats these massive ships and they dont pay us and then the general gets up and the general says mr trump is wrong doesnt he understand that japan pays us  percent of the cost of defending them oh great they say mr trump could we have a comment i said yeah why arent they paying  percent right and germany and south korea we have  soldiers and think of this one saudi arabia saudi arabia wouldnt be there for one week if we pulled out they have nothing but money nothing but money they have so much money they  they dont know what to do with it ok they dont know what to do with it whos  who is making our deals for us one deal like that has a massive impact on our budgets on our economics as a country were up to  trillion were very soon going to be  trillion trillion nobody even knows what  if i could take  i could take the great harold hamm i could say tell me what a trillion dollars is although hes worth almost a trillion so he may know he may know  but you know honestly most people dont even know what the hell it  its so much they even know they wouldnt know how to define it so heres the story we are going to do something really special and our message caught on when i started this we had all these pundits saying it wont happen and i had a little staff  corey lewandowski was great i have to tell you  and hes been very loyal and hes been on cnn and hes really been fighting for me which is very nice and i  i respect that a lot  hope hicks wheres hope come here hope come here hope get up here hope hope hicks the legendary hope hicks come on up here hope come come come shes shy get her up here come on hope come on hope we had a very small but tough team we had a small  heres hope hicks theyre not going to lift you over that barricade probably look at her shes very shy shes actually  shes a very shy person but shes a great person shes done an amazing job and we had a staff of between george  wheres our george come on over here come on fellows get over here just stand over here someplace get up get up on the dais come on id get hope up but she cant get through the secret service people there and what happened  so we had a small staff and i got criticized for it theyd say so and so  i wont use names because i dont want to embarrass anybody  so and so has spent many times what trump has spent and has a much bigger staff and then we win i dont get any credit youre supposed to get credit if you have smaller staff less payroll and you win but in politics you dont get credit so anyway so i want to thank my entire group then we beefed it up because were really now in the final stretch  threeandahalf months and paul manafort has done an amazing job hes here someplace wheres paul  paul manafort  oh good you made it paul manafort has done a fantastic  and all of pauls people paul brought on the staff and we really do we have a great staff of talented people a great staff and most of them are right here and john and everybody  my man right here and michael you have to be  michael come on up michael get up here michael come on get a little tv time look at him  i dont know  hired for hollywood i tend to doubt it but you never know come on up rick so we have a great group of people and we have a group of people that really wants to win and i think knows how to win and weve all sort of been winning all our lives this group of people in front of me i know so many of you weve been winning all our lives weve got exactly three months and three weeks i am going to be working so hard im not going to like last time where they disappeared for the last monthandahalf what happened where is everybody what happened and give obama credit he was on every television show he was all over the place were not going to disappear so we have a really great chance of taking our country back of change and of getting great supreme court justices  so i want to thank everybody i love you folks this has been such an incredible movement i love you i know so many of you were going to go all the way and ill tell you what when we get there we will indeed make america great again i love you thank you everybody thank you"
37,"Trump","thank you mike thank you everybody  who   thank you everybody  this is a great honor great state i have a lot of property  people in virginia pay a lot of checks  bing  every night every day a lot of great success ive had in virginia over the years and we have just phenomenal stuff in loudoun county as you know and we have down in charlottesville and some other stuff tremendous tremendous beautiful property charlottesville is right next to thomas jefferson  he was an architect you know he had great taste he had great taste he understood thats some of the most beautiful land ive ever seen so i love virginia and we are going to win virginia  were going to win virginia  im going to go over some of the statistics when tim kaine was governor theyre not pretty theyre not pretty but before i do i just want to say that debbie wasserman schultz  i always knew she was highly overrated i always knew  not good but she just got fired they said debbie youre fired get out debbie  out boom boy they were  how about that for disloyalty though in terms of hillary clinton in all fairness because debbie wasserman schultz has been so much for hillary clinton and  politicians folks other than mike pence of course hes great but these politicians  hey look look look so theres no loyalty there right theres no loyalty none whatsoever it gets a little heat and they fire her  get outta here get outta here she knew what was going on hillary clinton knew what was going on she knew everything that was going on she knew its a rigged system that bernie sanders never had a chance ok he never had a chance and if you look at it look whats going on theyre having a lot of people marching now and a lot of those people are going to vote for us ill tell you right now  a lot of them and not even because they like me or they dont like me although i have to say have you seen the polls that just came out  right we had like the biggest bounce that anyone can remember they said well if he gets out of the convention with no bounce that will be a success did we have nine points or something ten points  were leading were actually leading in the polls  and the cnn poll was so good i may have to start liking them again and i dont   no they treat me unfairly but you know whats more important the poll but you know the big poll the big poll thats november th thats the poll we care about right  but look how disloyal crooked hillary clinton was to somebody that put her life on the line i mean she  what she did in order to take advantage of bernie sanders and all of his supporters debbie wasserman schultz what she did in order to make sure that the system the rigged system stays intact and hillary gets it and then you see the emails can you imagine they talk about religion they talk about religion can you imagine if that was my email id right now be on the front page of every newspaper it would be horrible and theyre trying to play it down well that wasnt so bad that wasnt so bad but could you imagine seriously theres such a different standard so heres the story heres the story so debbie was totally loyal to hillary and hillary threw her under a bus and it didnt take her more than five minutes to make that decision man i dont want her covering my back ill tell you right now its true its true now the other thing im surprised at you know its nice when youre not reading speeches isnt it really because i can talk about current events this stuff happened  minutes ago you know if youre reading speeches i see these guys i dealt with a lot of them ive actually been a very political person all my life ive always been on the other side but now for  months ive been doing this and i like this side in a certain way better because we can do things better they used to love me when i was just a contributor id give millions of dollars i was a contributor i know i like this better i like being nonestablishment better but with bernie when you look at what happened the thing that surprises me most is how he folded he folded i thought he was really hanging out tough tough tough then they find these horrible emails talking about his religion and is he jewish and is he an atheist and what and thats not going to play well man thats rough and thats not as bad as some of the other ones and i said theres no way that bernie sanders shows up to make a speech theres no way that he can ever endorse crooked hillary clinton anymore right theres no way and today i see him trying to make the case and his own people are out there booing ok theyre out there booing so its pretty bad then ill tell you hillary clinton ive been saying this for a long time and i got it from bernie sanders he said she suffers from bad judgment right bad judgment she suffers from very bad judgment her instincts are bad theyre no good her instincts are defective her instincts are defective but shes got shes low energy she actually is low energy shell go home shell take a nap for  or  hours then shell come back no naps for trump no naps i dont take naps we dont have time we dont have time you ever see hillary where she comes out and shell read a teleprompter for a little while and then shell go home you dont see her for   days and then she comes back and then they used to i remember in iowa they put like  or  people really nice people in there sitting around a little table and everyones saying well id like to ask her a question no no no youre too tough this is what we have how do you think isis is going to react  i dont think so right i dont think so not going to be good no we have tough enemies out there we have tough mean vicious horrible horrible people these are horrible horrible human beings we need toughness folks its about time we need strength we need toughness we need smarts we need warmth we need compassion we need everything we need everything but we dont need somebody that goes home and takes naps we dont need naps  but what did surprise me was that bernie was so soft on this i really  i was amazed because i watched his speech you know  we must vote for hillary clinton i mean the hatred hes got why would he do that he looks better if he didnt do it to me hey what do i have to do with it i dont care whatever he wants to do but could you imagine if whats taking place now with the democrats took place in cleveland and by the way i have to tell you cleveland did an amazing job thank you ohio thank you cleveland what a job  i spoke to the police chief calvin  did a phenomenal job up there but what we had  and the secret service working with the secret service what a job they did but clevelands a beautiful place i mean really i was so happy we had no problems they were trying to show  i know they showed this one square it was this big square and they had a few people they bring the cameras in close you know really close because they dont want to show all the beautiful grass you know with no people on it and you know why ill tell you why because people like our message people like our message they really like it and if you look at philadelphia  i went to school in philadelphia i love philadelphia if you look at philadelphia what theyre going through right now it looks like a lot of people its  degrees there and speaking of that by the way i dont know if you saw it did you know i went to the other room so you have a second room and then outside you have over  people and its  degrees out no think of it and the first time i ever did it i said lets go  lets go to the second room first right thats the anteroom but lets go because its the overflow room i said  so i went in there we surprised them we were nice but you know we love these people but you know what i also like i dont have to do it later  and outside we have a lot of people and i wish theyd let them in the fire department wont let them in because of a fire regulation which is very sad because theyre outside its  we have speakers out there i think the speakers are burning up folks it is hot i wish the fire marshal  wheres the fire marshal is he around here come on fire marshal if they could get in fire marshal  you know you have doors that go right out to the outside i promise theres nothing like you dont have a problem i feel badly we have those people  we have people standing outside you could get a few more people inside if they could let them in so thats the way a builder would talk ok thats the way a builder  so you had the firing of the head of the dnc and that was a vicious firing a lot of things happened you had her firing hillary clintons total disloyalty was at play it really was people dont say that they wont say that in the media oh if i did something with reince can you imagine if i fired reince i wouldnt do that because reince has done such a great job  reince priebus what a job he has done  and i always used to say for months now ive been saying ill take reince over debbie and everyone said oh but debbies a super star i said so is reince and then it turned out that debbie flamed out and shes gone but the disloyalty was incredible and i really mean that because honestly whether you like her or not she worked very hard to rig the system so that hillary got in its true right its true no its true she worked very very hard to rig the system little did she know that china russia one of our many many friends came in and hacked the hell out of us can you imagine can you imagine what theyre hacking i guarantee well find the  emails  why did hillary get rid of her middle name hillary no but why did she get rid of it hillary rotten clinton rotten clinton hillary rotten clinton right maybe thats why its too close no no its too close its too close you think mike pence would say this i dont think so by the way did i do a good job with mike pence ok  him and his family what a highquality person you know you have to vet people right and we vetted mike and they came back and these are killers and they came back with many pages on certain people ok many pages i  id like to write a book  many many pages with mike they came back with like nothing hes like the most perfect human being this guy i said mike did you ever do anything wrong in your whole life no i dont think so  he is  where is he hes the best guy that guy is great i love this guy i love him  i love him but you know what i really like about mike so listen to this to me a very important thing is her bad judgment now whether you like her choice tim kaine  nobody even knows who he is no  hes done a terrible job for virginia i assumed  they said he picked a  you know he got picked because of virginia because virginia is very important and im doing very well here hey hey im employing a lot of people here and they dont employ anybody i spent a lot of money in potomac falls sterling that area i mean i spent a lot of money we have great great things happening next year we have the senior pga championship coming thousands and thousands of people will come into virginia and spend a lot of money thank you i love you too darling but  but just think of it so hillary clinton has  almost  percent of the people want a progressive ok we dont have to like that but thats ok thats where they are they want to give everything away and raise your taxes thats what happens no no she will have a tax raise by the way i have the largest tax cut of anybody running for office republican or democrat ok  but hillary clinton  hillary clinton will have a tax cut that is not there its going to be a tax cut times  in reverse like a rocket ship we have the biggest tax cut proposed i guess in the last four years and its  were going to get it through at least were going to get most of it through ill tell you what im going to try and get all of it through but we have  and its policy its you know put out there that doesnt mean theres not a little negotiation because were going to have to negotiate but were going to have it go hillary clintons going to have one of the biggest tax increased in the history of our country because what shes proposing youre going to have to pay for its very simple very simply you know maybe shell  you know after she gets rid of bernie get rid of all this stuff that doesnt help you by the way but what shes proposing she needs to have a massive massive tax increase nobody every talks about that do you notice she never talks about whos going to pay for it and how theyre going to pay but just statistically shes going to need a very major tax cut but heres something to me thats very interesting fifty percent of that party is bernie sanders almost and theyre very passionate and thats a much more passionate side her people they fall asleep ok they fall asleep theyre watching her with bernies people theyre really out there they  say what you want about bernie sanders he got it on free trade he got it freed trade now im  im totally  im a free trader i believe in free trade  you know they get it all wrong because they just dont say it properly but i want smart trade i want  i want to trade with other countries but i dont want to lose  billion a year  with china thank you china we love you very much but were not going to lose  billion and i dont want to have a trade imbalance with japan where they send us millions of cars and we send them some beef and then they send it back and then we send some wheat wheat they send cars we send wheat sounds like weve got to send a lot of wheat right the trade imbalance is massive and with mexico we have an unbelievably big trade imbalance so they kill us at the border they kill us theyre killing us at the border and we have one of the biggest trade imbalances and what happens what happens im not even including the drugs right the drugs are pouring across you know i won the state of new hampshire and i got very very friendly with the people in new hampshire ill never forget them because thats an amazing group of people and i said whats your biggest problem they said heroin pouring across the southern border i said heroin new hampshire because you look at new hampshire its so beautiful with the lakes and the little beautiful roads and the trees and the forests and i said you dont have heroin i said you have he said mr trump you have no idea its one of the worst areas for that it comes pouring across the southern border i said you know what if i win im going to sit im going to fix that problem i am going to fix that problem im going to fix that problem and one of the ways i appreciate that you know i always like to say if i win because honestly life is a very strange thing and i dont want to be accused by them of being arrogant so ill say if but it better be when or im going to be very angry at you folks from virginia from virginia but the folks in new hampshire and youre having the same problems but theyre having it for whatever reason disproportionately badly heroin is pouring across the border and its going a lot of it its going all over the country by the way everybodys got the problem you buy it for less than a candy bar and our youth is being poisoned and plenty of other people but our youth is being poisoned by this stuff heroin heroin and what were going to do thank you what were going to do is first of all the border patrol agents endorsed me  theyve never done that before and their job is easier now without trump their job is easier without trump because you know right now they just stand and people go by these are great people i got to know them very well the border patrol agents want to do their job its a much tougher job probably a much more dangerous jobs when you stop people and say sorry folks boom go back but thats more dangerous than saying we cant do anything its called stand back stand back and leave them alone let them walk right in how stupid are we how stupid are we ok so i spoke to them when they endorsed me so i said let me ask you a wall how important they said mr trump its very very important very very important and they know they know see i just saved a million dollars somebody else would go out and hire a consultant who knows nothing theyd come in from harvard theyd spend about a year at the border theyd learn nothing theyd then write this  page report that nobody will read theyll charge you  million for the report and you have no idea what just happened  as opposed to saying like i did with the border patrol is a wall good they said very good they actually used an interesting expression they said its a vital tool to turn things around it was a very interesting expression they didnt say great bad they just said its a vital tool mr trump to turn things around especially the drug traffic because its very tough and we can build that wall so easily and by the way mexico is going to pay for that wall   just because theyre going to pay for the wall and ive got great  we got great marks on the  on the speech the other night and everyone did everybody did so great we had such  by the way i have to say the republican national convention was such a tremendous success it was so great i mean we had a couple of people that i think probably destroyed their careers but who knows  but honestly  no but honestly that was such an incredible success and look at whats going on in philadelphia that was such a beautiful deal the city of cleveland was great the law enforcement was unbelievable we had no riots we had no nothing it was unbelievable ill never forget it as long as i live it was unbelievable  and i made a speech  and i have to tell you because i figured this wouldnt happen because if i made a speech  if i gave the gettysburg address as given as good as anybody could possible give  i figured you know you always get  you always  i got great reviews on this speech i got great reviews we got standing ovations some people said well the speech was a little long thats because we had  or  minutes of like standing ovation we had applause and i had a great time doing it because im talking about something that i love were in a movement folks this is a movement this isnt just  i love what were doing together right  i love  i love what were doing together i love it and what really  what i have to say is this so hillary clinton has bad judgment she shouldnt have picked this guy big mistake because he is the exact opposite what all of the bernie people  now if he got  percent of the vote or  percent of the vote or  percent of the vote its  but you know what he almost beat her if the system wasnt gamed if the system wasnt gamed he wouldve beat her he wouldve beaten her now think of this so instead of picking somebody and you dont have to go with pocahontas you dont have to go that far  who by the way who hasnt done anything shes the worst  she is the worst senator in the us senate you know shes got a fresh mouth other than that shes got nothing going shes has got  she has done nothing in the us senate but you dont have to pick her but you could have picked a liberal person and we understand it we could live with it and you know she could have had party unity instead they have thousands and thousands of people going crazy because she didnt pick somebody representative she didnt pick somebody representative of whats going on lets get  look again shes got bad judgment whether its libya whether its benghazi whether its at night with the calls with the calls everybodys calling the only call she answers is her friend calls she picks that one up but she doesnt pick up the calls for help shes got bad judgment bernie sanders said shes got bad judgment shes got bad judgment when it came to picking a vice presidential candidate for that side of the party  i actually just asked mike pence  i said mike do you think shes going to be forced to change because honestly now i wouldnt pick him i wouldnt pick him for a different reason though you know why i wouldnt pick him  so mike pence of indiana has done an unbelievable job a tripleaaa bond rating so many different things job creation top in virtually every category right towards the top at the top listen to this during tim kaines tenure as governor of virginia plus hes not very popular i thought that i would see polls saying hes at  percent and trump is going to lose virginia im going to  people dont even like the guy and  weird little dude there i dont know whats going on with him during tim kaines tenure as governor of virginia from  to  the unemployment rate of the state more than doubled so i immediately went back to my statistician i said listen do me a favor will you please check it he came back he said hey maybe hes wrong but more than doubled this is your great governor right now governor mike pence cut the unemployment rate from  percent to less than five percent quickly  since  indianas gone from st in the nation for veterans unemployment to second and its going to go first ok  veterans unemployment during tim kaine thats the guy that bad judgment crooked hillary clinton bad judgment such bad judgment we cant have another president with bad judgment we cant do it  during tim kaines tenure as governor the state of virginia lost  manufacturing jobs now indiana gained  now its a different time and different everything he was you know so im not comparing  theyre not  because theyll say well one was here and one was there but ill tell you if mike pence or me was running virginia wed do great this guy did a lousy job you know why hes a political hack thats why hes a political hack look what hes done look what hes done hes always been in politics he likes politics he wants to be in politics always ok during tim kaines tenure as governor of virginia it averaged almost no gdp growth and indiana as you know is doing great i mean think of it heres a beauty ok nobody is going to vote for tim kaine when you hear this one ok tim kaine i never even heard of this guy but thats ok less than a week after tim kaine became governor of virginia  one week  he proposed a nearly  billion tax increase   billion  including a tax increase on people earning as little at  a year  he tried to pass transportation reform he failed whereas mike pence had tremendous  i mean the whole thing is ridiculous so a  billion tax increase his first week do we want this as a president now you know look hopefully we dont have to worry about it i will say this virginia has lost one in three manufacturing jobs since bill clinton  these are my statisticians theyre great  signed the agreement to put china into the world trade organization dont forget he did that but bill clinton signed something that was the worst trade bill ever in the history of this country  ok  in the history of this country nafta that was bill clinton people dont realize  ill tell you a little joke see how hot it is everyone everyones sweating and soaking wet right heres the difference i wouldnt pay the hotel bill id say were in a hotel were in a ballroom and you know what these are grown companies were in a ballroom and if were in a ballroom its not supposed to be so hot that everybody in the audience is using as a fan so what they do is they turn the air conditioning down because they save money so then i would not pay them and you know what i do i pay my bills so fast with somebody good with somebody average i pay them ok with somebody great a lot of times i give them bonuses but here we are in a ballroom and im like  i feel like im in a sauna ok  right  right so i dont know what hotel this is but you ought to try turning on the air conditioning or were not going to get you paid  these people   is  am i right its hot  just so you know im really good at this business you make a lot more money if you own a hotel and you let people suffer and dont turn on air conditioning you make a lot more money you would be surprised at how much it costs but this is ridiculous and  so then therell an article donald trump refuses to pay the bill of course  and you know what the smart people say trump is smart the other people would say isnt that terrible ok i think the ballroom and the people that own this hotel should be ashamed of themselves all right so look  look so virginia lost one in three manufacturing jobs since the bill clinton bill hillary supported chinas entry into wto roanoke which is a beautiful place by the way has lost one  and ive been here many times  has lost one in three manufacturing jobs ok since the clinton disasters last year the us trade deficit with tpp countries  i mean i could go into this  i could read this stuff to you it gets a little boring after a while but its all the same thing we have  hillary clinton wanted to approve tpp thats transpacific partnership and then i announced that im against it and then she heard me make in a speech this is what ive heard a friend of mine told me and i basically said the various reasons including monetary manipulation currency manipulation et cetera why its no good why it will be another nafta but maybe even worse cant be worse but itll be as bad ok different countries but itll be as bad and she heard me and she said hell kill me in the debate so what happened is she all of a sudden came out against tpp but as sure as youre sitting there shes going to approve tpp if she won she will approve it shell make a change shell make a comma shell say move that comma now i can do it ok folks sixthousand pages of material that most people havent read it is a disaster transpacific partnership is a disaster you cant let it happen we will never let it happen i will never ever let it happen  and i dont want to make deals with many countries i want to do oneonone deals oneonone youve got to see this deal its like a fancy jigsaw puzzle lines  going here here there so if one of the country misbehaves you cant do anything because youre so locked up into this very complex agreement and believe me its just like obamacare thousands of pages and nobody in congress read it and now its a disaster and we will repeal it and replace it with something fabulous ok all right  but  but were going to have something thats going to be very special and i have to tell you i appreciate you all being here and i really wish  i appreciate it thank you thank you thank you thank you  and i appreciate the folks in the room next door which is almost as big as this and its packed also  and even more than you folks i appreciate the people standing outside in  theyre dying theyre dying  although i venture say that theyre more comfortable than i am right now its probably  i think its actually cooler outside than it is in this damned ballroom ridiculous  ridiculous but you know what ill tell you you know what i love look at this room its packed you know what i love and the other room is packed what i love nobody left not one person i always watch the doors if i see doors starting to open people pouring out i usually stop but that never happens with me never ever but i stop nobody leaves because you know what were in this together were in this together this is a movement so time magazine just did an another cover i talked about it you saw the one from the back of my head right its pretty full back there you know could be better could be better but not bad but a picture from the back of my head the guy was standing right over me with a camera like this i studied that picture very closely i didnt read the story but i did study the picture you know i think thats number five or six that weve had so i think ive had two in my lifetime and five or six in the last few months where you know we had this incredible thing going on and they called it a movement and bill oreilly calls is a movement hes never seen anything like it he said in his professional career in his whole lifetime he actually said this is the single greatest political phenomena that hes ever witnessed and brit hume said it and a lot of people have said it  and i really mean this its not about me its about you theres  im a messenger theres a group of people in this country thats massive you know they used to call it a silent majority i dont use the term its a noisy majority because weve had it weve had it with the iran deal weve had it with our depleted military weve had it with no borders  weve had it with education where were ranked right near the bottom were doing horribly weve had it where they want to essentially abolish your second amendment you have no protection for yourself all right weve had it  and by the way the nra endorsed me and theyre great people  percent and the evangelicals  how many evangelicals to we have in here  you better get out and vote because you didnt vote for romney and you better get out and vote for me you know we have the johnson amendment where lyndon johnson who was very powerful put in an amendment where basically our pastors our ministers and all religions they dont have the right to speak up and i had  i had a meeting  i was telling franklin graham whos a great guy i was telling jerry falwell jr who is a great guy great guy i mean so many we had a meeting where we had  to  pastors ministers and they were saying we love you and they were praying and it was like this incredible scene and i said ok well folks can you endorse me well we cant do that why because well lose our tax exempt status i said why now nobody brought this up to me they were living with it nobody was going to go fight it i said why do you lose your tax exempt status well were not allowed to speak and i said wait and i looked into it i said whoa and that was passed by the ultimate politician lyndon johnson i mean its not like were dealing with the pope this was lyndon johnson  smart tough guy but were smarter and tougher  but look that was passed by a politician because he had problems with some of the churches in texas where they were going after him for good reason and i said wait a minute folks now we put in our platform that were going to work like hell to get rid of the johnson amendment because   because your representatives ministers pastors rabbis they have totally lost their voice and dont kid yourself thats whats happening to religion in this country because you see the same numbers that i see so i think this  if youre evangelical if youre christian if youre jewish if you have religion you better go out and vote for trump because this is going to be the last chance youre ever going to get to get this thing going ok  thank you thank you  so i said in my  i will say this i said in my speech in the other night and i meant it i thank the evangelicals because i want to get these tremendous voices they said trump cant win south carolina right and i said why i have a tremendous piece of ground i won with the evangelicals i won all over with the evangelicals because they get it theyre smart and they understand they know im not perfect im not perfect but they know i love them and they know im going to fight for them better than somebody that is perfect im going to fight for them im going to fight for other religions im going to fight im going to fight for people to be able to speak and actually when they said this to me i was in an office building very high up and im looking down i said to these powerful pastors these power men and women theyre just powerful people just tremendous strength and energy and conviction they were in a whirlwind it was beautiful their voices i said but that means that you are less powerful than those people walking down the street i pointed to the street they have a right to talk and you dont you dont have your right to talk thats our religion thats our religion  in my case im presbyterian im a protestant but thats our religion and my minister who i like a lot doesnt have the right to speak were going to end that folks with one chance were going to have it so you better go back to your churches and you better get everybody to vote because four years ago they didnt get up they didnt vote for romney and to this day a lot of people understand it though some people do understand it frankly you better get up and you better vote it you vote  if you think about it if you take christians jewish some of the catholic take the religions its bigger than men and its bigger than women its bigger than men you know men are  percent women are  percent the religion is like what  percent if you get up and vote were going to get rid of that and were going to free up great people to go and speak what they want to speak about and they should be able to speak  so just a couple of things i would like to bring mike up just a couple things we are going to strengthen our military our military is really depleted its not good  i didnt want to go into iraq we got there i said keep the oil they didnt keep the oil these people dont know what theyre doing you know in the old days youre in a war to the victor belong the spoils right today we get nothing trillions of dollars in costs thousands and thousands of lives lost we get nothing iraq is a disaster the middle east is worse now than it was  years ago by a factor of  if we would have done nothing we would have been much better off we have to build up our military we never needed it so much we never needed our military so much  so were going to take care of our country were going to take care of our vets were going to take care of our people were going to make america great again and i have to tell you one of the really good decisions because i laugh when they say do you think mr trump likes governor mike pence i love this guy hes great hes great and everybody does im getting such great marks and such great reviews unlike hillary did i ask you before do you think shell change he looked at me and said no way because its hard to do right she may be forced  she may be forced to change he actually  ill tell you  tim kaine stands for the exact opposite of all of the bernie sanders people i mean its ridiculous what she did again bad judgment so im going to have mike say just a few of the final words and im going to sit down and watch him he is some great person hes got some wonderful family and we are having such fun going all over the place and so mike can finish off and i want to thank you folks thank you     if you guys want to ask a couple of questions fine you go ahead mike   go ahead   were going to work one thing we have to do for the youth and its a question i get asked mike more than any other question we have young fantastic people going to college and theyre choking on their debt ok theyre choking on debt they havent started life yet and some of them have given up before they start it because they see no way were going to work on a plan and were working on it now so that we can help young people get through college and not die  i mean some of these kids what theyre doing is incredible  the massive depression thats going on because they see no way of ever being able to pay it back now part of thats going to be jobs but were working on a plan now to take care of youth with respect to college debt were going to work on a very good plan we have to we have to    do you own the hotel    i bet    onehundred percent we have to stand by israel  percent  yes yes hello   these are usually the toughest questions           he knows he knows jacob that wall will go up so fast and be so big and powerful and as goodlooking as we can make it that your head will spin ok believe me its going to go up fast thank you     go ahead how about over here go ahead sure   congratulations    cut your taxes and no more crazy regulations ok    big  right   all right the regulations are out of control you know mike  so ive been all over the country and i wouldve always said taxes would be like the biggest thing if i had my guess i would say that people are more angry about regulations than the fact that we pay among the highest taxes in the world   so well cut the regulations ok   ok how about one more  one more question   one more   whos got a good one whos got a good one go ahead give him  i like that question actually right give him a mic because thats such a great question go ahead    wow are you a minister or a pastor he is thank you very

38,"Trump","thank you very much everybody wow thank you  thank you very much what a privilege to be here with the incredible  and i mean incredible  men and women of the veterans of foreign wars and we set today an alltime registration record thats pretty good right congratulations to you spending time with our veterans has been the greatest honor of this campaign i want to thank commanderinchief big john and really for the welcome he has been so fantastic from the time we walked in he has been so fantastic also many thanks to bob wallace auxiliary president francisca guilford and for your incoming leadership you have brian duffy and colette bishop two terrific people  two terrific people before going any further today id like to bring up on to this stage my good friend governor mike pence  and by the way mike is the son of a soldier and the father of a marine mike    thank you mike and thanks again to everyone for inviting me to address you today the veterans  i love you too  the veterans of foreign wars represent the very very best of america when im president i pledge to work closely with your organization and your members to accomplish our shared goals our veterans are the bravest and the finest people on earth  the members of your organization have fought for the american flag and boy have you fought on distant battlefields all across the world your members have shed their blood and poured out their hearts for this nation like nobody else our debt to you is eternal  yet our politicians have totally failed you our most basic commitment to provide health and medical care to those who fought for us so bravely has been violated completely the va scandals that have occurred are widespread and totally inexcusable as we know many have died waiting for care that never came a permanent stain on our government can you imagine the waste and corruption  and i tell you we will find it and we will find it big league  when i become president in january   ive recently released a detailed step veterans reform plan and weve worked on the plan with the chairman of the veterans affairs committee in the house and a really good guy who loves the vets jeff miller  he is a good man were going to take care of our veterans like theyve never been taken care of before  the other candidate in this race you know her name crooked hillary clinton  and believe me folks she is crooked  has a much different view she recently said of the va scandal that its not as widespread as its been purported to be its like shes trying to sweep it under the rug which by the way politicians have done for years and years and years its going to be four more years of the same if she ever got in but thats not going to happen  make america great again youre right thank you we know how she takes cares of the veterans just look at her invasion of libya and her handling of benghazi a disaster or look at her emails which put americas entire national security at risk and to think she was here yesterday i guess she didnt do very well   were going to bring honesty back to government and that starts with fixing the veterans administration we will fix it here is my  step plan for veterans reform one i will appoint a secretary of veterans affairs who will make it their personal mission to clean up the va and this person man or woman will be outstanding with an outstanding track record  in other words a person that can get it done number two im going to use every lawful authority to remove and discipline federal employees or managers who breach their public trust three  i will ask congress to pass a bill giving the va secretary full authority to remove or discipline any employee who risks the health safety or wellbeing of a veteran  i will appoint a commission to investigate all of the wrongdoing at the va of which there is plenty and then present those findings to congress as the basis for reforming the entire system five im going to make sure that the honest and dedicated people of the va of which we have many have their jobs protected and are put in line for promotion when they do a good job we are going to get them promoted like they deserve  i will create a private white house hotline this could keep me very busy at night folks this will take the place of twitter  lot of truth to that that is answered by a real person  hours a day to make sure that no valid complaint about the va ever falls through the cracks  now this is the tough part this is the tough part i will instruct my staff that if a valid complaint is not acted upon then the issuer who brought it  directly to me and i want to have it will bring it directly to me and i will pick up the phone personally and get it completed and get it taken care of thats a lot of work we better do a good job because thats a lot of work  but i want to have somebody a real person and a really competent person in the white house with that hotline going and if that persons not doing the job im going to find out about it and thats the best way to find out about it thats called real life thats called business instead of giving bonuses to employees for wasting money we are going to create a new incentive program that rewards employees for saving money and improving the quality of care  our vsa  programs will be reformed to ensure that veterans are put in the front of the line for jobs in this country they fought and they protect us now were going to fight  them theyre going to put right in the front of the line and these are our great people and by the way governor pence is right at the top of the nation in employment for vets when he took over he was number  or  now hes right at the top he has done an incredible job with respect to employment for vets so mike good going and keep it going  were going to increase the number of mental health care professionals and increase mental health outreach to veterans outside of the system so important were going to ensure every veteran in america gets timely access to top quality care including the best care in the world for our female veterans  the veterans health system will remain a public system because it is a public trust but never again will we allow any veteran to suffer or die waiting for care that means veterans will have the right to go to a va facility or the right to see a private doctor or clinic of their choice whatever is fastest and best for the veteran there will be no more fiveday waits in line if youre waiting in line youre going to go to a private doctor across the street a private or public hospital across the street or nearby and youre going to be taken care of quickly and efficiently people are waiting in line five days six days seven days and many are dying with a simple procedure they would live and theyre dying because they cant even get to see their doctor so theres not going to be any more of that and we will pick up the bill it will cost us less money and the care will be amazing ok you have my word on that  come january  if im elected president youre going to notice a change in the va and in the whole entire government system which is a mess  all you have to do is try to get on an airplane and youll see what a mess it is a change in attitude and a change in results will absolutely take place so fast right at the beginning government is going to start working for the people again the special interests opposing our reform and they do oppose it for their own reasons and reform for america the same people who have led us to one economic and foreign policy disaster after another the global corporations and the media executives who oppose our plans and they are opposing them strongly  we need plans for change and we want to keep the system in place except for the section thats rigged and thats a lot of it were getting rid of our rigged system i started using that term a yearandahalf ago and now everybodys using it this morning i was watching one of the democrats who ive been talking about as a rigged system he used the word rigged system im going to have to come up now with another word its very sad  but the system is rigged so badly rigged and its rigged against the veterans too thats why their message is that things cant change cant change with these people they cant change these are the same special interests who have driven the economy into the ground and who have created one calamity after another overseas  horrible horrible thought process these washington interests are telling americans to stay the course theyre telling us that we cant fix our trade deals or we cant fix our va or we cant fix our broken tax system or we cant fix immigration because theyre benefiting from the status quo they benefit they dont want to change we need change they dont want to change my message is the opposite things have to change and they have to change right now  here is just some of the change we need we need to change our tax energy and regulatory policies to produce millions of new jobs and trillions in new wealth and invest in our country and in our infrastructure which is falling apart all over this country  our roads our tunnels our bridges our airports our infrastructure is that of a thirdworld country not anymore and im very good at building remember that and i build undertime and underbudget very important you dont hear that from government very often those who seek to raise taxes and expand regulation will only weaken our country hamstring our economy and throw many millions more out of work and as you know hillary clinton wants to institute a massive tax increase massive tax increase and were already just about the highesttaxed nation in the world our immigration system must also be fixed so it lifts people out of poverty instead of throwing them into poverty which is what its doing right now our terrible trade deal must be renegotiated completely nafta is a disaster to keep jobs and wealth in america  were sending our jobs away were going to keep our jobs in america and were going to bring new jobs back  we need to change our foreign policy to focus in defeating and destroying isis a word you didnt hear last night at the democrat convention you didnt hear it they dont want to talk about it because in a very true way they really established isis because of weakness the people in this room know better than anybody else or any other audience what i mean by weakness but because of weakness isis has been established its also essential that we suspend the refugee flows from syria and other dangerous countries so we dont bring into the united states the same terrorism that our american soldiers are fighting overseas we have to be smart  thank you hillary clinton wants to bring in if you can believe this  percent more than president obama more and tim kaine wrote a letter very recently asking for more than even hillary wants what are we doing what are we doing we have to be the smart country again or were in big big trouble our depleted military must be completely rebuilt then from a position of strength and respect america needs to extend our hand in friendship to foreign nations who want to be our friends and we cant be taken advantage of by these countries that we work so closely with many of these countries are taking advantage of us folks theyre taking advantage of us we want to be friends but they also have to be friends with us remember that  something youve never heard from a politician  we want a more peaceful future for our world but peace will require new approaches not relying on the same failed voices of the past these are failed voices and now they want another four years and we need to fix the va so we never break our sacred commitment to our veterans never ever again  we can do all of these things we simply need to stop relying on the politicians who created these problems in the first place they are not going to do anything i call them all talk no action thats what they are they are politicians all talk no action we cant fix a rigged system by electing the people who rigged it in the first place  lets reject the doubters and the cynics and choose instead to believe in ourselves and in our country its time to follow the example of our amazing veterans who work together across racial lines

39,"Trump","so its been  days since crooked hillary clinton has had a press conference and you as reporters who give her all of these glowing reports should ask yourselves why and ill tell you why because despite the nice platitudes shes been a mess  you look at whats happened with isis which isnt even mentioned you look at whats happening with law and order they dont even mention our police they mention everybody but our police they dont have an american flag on the dais until we started complaining and then they ran up with two very small little flags one that we saw so you know i put myself through your news conferences often not that its fun  days no news conference for hillary clinton you oughta check it out because theres a lot going on her great disloyalty to the person that rigged the system for her debbie wasserman schultz she totally rigged it bernie sanders never had a chance and total disloyalty its like youre fired get out fast the email situation i call it the double email situation both very serious what was said in the last ones to the dnc was horrible absolutely horrible if i wouldve used language like they used about religion about race about everything else that they discuss in those emails i wouldve had to run and hide and probably drop out of the race with her everythings just fine so just ask yourself why she doesnt have news conferences and honestly the reason is because theres no way she can answer questions because the job she has done is so bad when they talk about change i noticed they have change shes been there for  years thirty years theres no change its going to be the same its going to be an extension of obama in my opinion worse she lied about tpp she was for tpp she saw me on television knocking the hell out of it because its a horror show its going to kill all our jobs its going to be almost as bad as nafta maybe worse which her husband signed by the way which destroyed this country destroyed manufacturing in the united states and ill do something about it thatll be so renegotiated and by the way yesterday for the first time she said she wants to renegotiate trade agreements first time yesterday well because of me she also saw me talking about tpp and currency manipulation and currency devaluation and she heard it and she said wow she cant win that subject in a debate so all of a sudden she goes and she goes against tpp her vice president is one of the biggest proponents of tpp and now hes going against it and bernie sanders was right he was against it they will go for tpp and vote it in very shortly after the election if she wins which for the sake of our country we all hope and i hope that she doesnt they will vote it in  just mark my words hopefully we dont have to worry about it  but she will vote shell change a comma shell change a paragraph of the  page document that nobodys even read on our side just so you understand the other countries know every word every paragraph every sentence every single comma and period we dont even read it our country because were led by stupid people so she saw me talking about tpp she realized that she couldnt defend it her special interests are pushing her hard because shes bought and sold by the special interests theyre pushing her very hard and so she said shes against it the day she gets in  which hopefully will never happen  she will approve or shortly thereafter tpp and that will be another disaster for job in our country ok so why dont we start off any questions yes sir   its just a total deflection this whole thing with russia in fact i saw her campaign manager i dont know his title mook i saw him on television and they asked him about russia and the hacking by the way they hacked  they probably have her  emails i hope they do they probably have her  emails that she lost and deleted because youd see some beauties there so lets see but i watched this guy mook and he talked about we think it was russia that hacked now first of all was what was said on those thats so bad but he said i watched it i think he was live but he said we think it was russia that hacked  and then he said  and this is in person sitting and watching television as ive been doing  and then he said could be trump yeah yeah trump trump oh yeah trump he reminded me of john lovitz for saturday night live in the liar  where hed go yes yes i went to harvard harvard yes yes this is the guy you have to see it yes it could be trump yes yes so it is so farfetched its so ridiculous honestly i wish i had that power id love to have that power but russia has no respect for our country and thats why  if it is russia nobody even knows this its probably china or it could be somebody sitting in his bed but it shows how weak we are it shows how disrespected we are total  assuming its russia or china or one of the major countries and competitors its a total sign of disrespect for our country putin and the leaders throughout the world have no respect for our country anymore and they certainly have no respect for our leader so i know nothing about it its one of the most farfetched ive ever heard yes jon    i never met putin i dont know who putin is he said one nice thing about me he said im a genius i said thank you very much to the newspaper and that was the end of it i never met putin   i would treat vladimir putin firmly but theres nothing that i can think of that id rather do than have russia friendly as opposed to the way they are right now so that we can go and knock out isis together with other people and with other countries wouldnt it be nice if we actually got along with people wouldnt it be nice if we actually got along as an example with russia im all for it and lets go get isis because we have to get isis and we have to get them fast you saw what happened with the priest its only going to get worse and hillary clinton wants to allow  percent more people from that region into our country and we have no idea who they are where they come from where their documentation is its only going to get worse and its going to start getting bad in our country were letting people come in by the tens of thousands you see what happened to the french priest a friend of mine he said he was going to france like three four months ago i saw him yesterday i said howd you like france he said i wouldnt go to france i wouldnt go to france because france is no longer france france is no longer france they wont like me for saying that but you see what happened in nice you see what happened yesterday with the priest who was supposed to be a spectacular man france is no longer france and this world better be very careful and they better get very tough and very smart and theyll never do it with hillary clinton and by the way in terms of change shes been there for  years shes been doing this for  years what shes going to go all of sudden things are going to change shes bought and sold  percent by special interests and lobbyists yes tom    none none   because its under order and ill release them when the audits completed nobody would release when its under  ive had audits for  or  years every year i have a routine audit im under audit when the audits complete ill release them but zero i mean i will tell you right now zero i have nothing to do with russia yes   i dont know i dont know it depends on the audit it depends on the audit not a big deal by the way just so you understand ive released my papers  pages of documents i built an unbelievable company tremendous cash tremendous company with some of the great assets of the world youve seen it you were all very disappointed when you saw it actually but thats ok far far great than anybody ever thought i have a great company i built an unbelievable company but if you look there youll see theres nothing in russia and as far as the tax returns as soon as the audits complete like any lawyer would tell you greta van susteren she was going over it a while ago shes a lawyer she said well no lawyer would let somebody release a tax return when theyre under audit its a routine audit ive gone through audits which i think is very unfair for  years i have friends that are very rich and never get audited im audited every year maybe thats because of politics who knows   im not going to tell putin what to do why should i tell putin what to do he already did something today where he said dont blame them essentially for your incompetence let me tell you its not even about russia or china or whoever it is thats doing the hacking it was about the things that were said in those emails they were terrible things talking about jewish talking about race talking about atheist trying to pin labels on people  what was said was a disgrace and it was debbie wasserman schultz and believe me as sure as youre sitting there hillary clinton knew about it she knew everything debbie wasserman schultz could not breathe without speaking and getting approval from hillary clinton couldnt breathe and you saw that it also showed that it was a fixed race but ive been saying that long before i saw the emails it was a rigged race it was totally rigged and debbie wasserman schultz rigged it for hillary clinton and the sad part is bernie sanders has to use an old word that i use on occasion hes lost his energy he wants to go home and go to sleep but hes got a lot of people that walked out last night now hundreds of people walked out of the democrat convention last night i didnt even hear about it nobody showed it i didnt see it on television you people dont talk about it the republican convention was incredible i hear i had one of the biggest bounces in decades like some people are saying nine points in fact a poll just came out ten minutes ago los angeles times trump  clinton  and the reason is that people are sick and tired of hillary clinton   why do i have to  get involved with putin i have nothing to do with putin ive never spoken to him i dont know anything about him other than he will respect me he doesnt respect our president and if it is russia  which its probably not nobody knows who it is  but if it is russia its really bad for a different reason because it shows how little respect they have for our country when they would hack into a major party and get everything but it would be interesting to see  i will tell you this  russia if youre listening i hope youre able to find the  emails that are missing i think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press lets see if that happens thatll be next yes sir   ok sure two big questions the minimum wage has to go up people are  at least  but it has to go up but i think that states  federal  i think that states should really call the shot as an example i live in new york its very expensive in new york you cant buy a hot dog for the money youre talking about you go to other states and its not expensive at all now what it does is puts new york at a disadvantage if the minimum wage is up companies move out and things bad things happen at the same time people have to be taken care of but what im really going to do on the minimum wage  but it has to go up now bernie sanders lied bernie sanders said in his speech the other day that donald trump wants the minimum wage to go below  i said where did he come up with that one that one is just like joe biden lied today he said that donald trump wants to carpet bomb  he was on television  he said donald trump wants to carpet bomb the enemy in the middle east now that was ted cruz that said that that was not donald trump i mean hes not a very bright guy but that was ted cruz that said it and he said it with such surety  donald trump wants to carpet bomb  i never said i wanted to carpet bomb that was ted cruz you remember ted cruz said it you will confirm that i think go ahead so i would like to raise it to at least  and what im going to do is im going to bring jobs back to this country so that people can start working again so that the  and the  and the numbers youre talking about are going to  literally theyre going to be peanuts compared to what people can make in the country because im going to bring jobs back from mexico which is booming booming i have a friend who builds plants and hes a great builder of plants and i was with him the other day  great guy he builds massive plants for automobiles for computers for anything thats what he does i think hes the biggest but certainly one of the biggest  and i said hows it going he said unbelievable oh good thats good news the countrys doing well no the countrys not doing well but mexico is unbelievable the plants im building in mexico ive never seen anything  its the eighth wonder of the world and hes not happy hes an american guy hed rather build them here but he said its unbelievable thats whats happened to our country because we have leadership that doesnt know what theyre doing   yes were going to be listing yeah were going to be giving a list of those territories and if you come from those territories we have extreme vetting and were going to have extreme vetting anyway look we have people coming into this country who have very evil intentions and we have people whether in san bernardino or whether its the world trade center or whether its a lot of other things and you look all over the world and you see whats happening you look at orlando how bad was that and that was horrible that was going after the gay community it looks like we cant let this happen we cannot let this happen we cannot let people come in now hillary clinton likes to up it her running mate tim kaine who by the way did a terrible job in new jersey first act he did in new jersey was ask for a  billion tax increase and hes not very popular in new jersey and he still isnt what i mean virginia the first thing he did the first thing that tim kaine did he asked for a  billion tax increase and hes not very popular so let me just tell you and i went all over virginia and i was there the other day and i thought hed be popular hes not popular because he asked for tax increases big tax increases in virginia big and also the unemployment went up i think it doubled or close to doubled during his tenure but what he wanted to do is very strongly and hes on record he wanted to have even more of the people from that region of the world come in than hillary clinton wants and its unacceptable ok yes    i saw that   right   i do have a reaction to the prosecutor in baltimore who indicted those police officers i do i think she ought to prosecute herself ok thats my reaction i think it was disgraceful what she did and the way she did it and the news conference that she had where they were guilty before anybody even knew the facts and i give a lot of respect and a lot of credit to those police officers who probably could have made a deal i give a lot of respect a lot of credit that they stuck it out and you had victory after victory after victory and she had no chance dont forget she prosecuted the best case what she thought was her best cases first she should prosecute herself she should be held accountable   well that was a bad case to prove it that was a bad case i mean if youre going to do that its ok because you have to you know there are times when police officers behave very badly but you have to get the right time this was not one of those times and i think that she is a disgrace to the world of prosecutors for what she did yes maam   yeah   i have a great relationship with governor pence we spent the last three days together he was absolutely my first choice and i never wavered despite the press the press was saying and it was interesting i spoke to him at  him and his wife and i told him that i was going to be choosing them if id be lucky enough for him to accept and he accepted and that was it for me that was it but right around that time you had the attack in nice and i was going to have a news conference either the following morning or the next day and of course i had to delay the news conference because there was attack a horrible attack horrible in france and i delayed the news conference and everyone said oh hes having second thoughts i never had a second thought in my life it was such a lie i mean so many lies in the press but it was such a lie and he has been so great honestly hes been even better than i thought ok better   i think everythings is out of date we have a whole new world when i said that nato to wolf blitzer is obsolete i got attacked three days later people that study nato said you know trump is right you know what we have a lot of things that are out date because theyre  and  and  years old  nato you know this isnt a country from  years ago today we have a different threat we have a terror threat and we have an isis threat and by the way isis isnt even mentioned its not even mentioned during the democratic convention and everyones talking about it the reason they cant mention it is because they grew it go ahead   i would  katy i would renegotiate so much of everything im going to renegotiate our trade deals where were losing with everybody katy im going to renegotiate our military deals where were protecting countries and theyre not living up to the bargain theyre not living up to the bargain and everyone agrees with me except for the media and the media never says that i like nato just so you understand i like nato i like the concept of nato it is somewhat outdated because it doesnt cover terror the way it should ive been saying this for six months now a couple of months ago front page wall street journal we are going to cover terror they announced  somebody i think natos great but its got to be modernized and  and countries that were protecting have to pay what theyre supposed to be paying   yes   i am a person that believes in enhanced interrogation yes and by the way it works   ill tell you what let me say it once again let me say it once again ok many countries including the nato countries some of which i think you have five that are current that have paid what they owe and they can afford to pay this its not like they cant afford it they just see us as a soft touch you know in business we say somebodys a soft touch i dont know if ive been called a soft touch but maybe i have sometimes but in business they call them a soft touch they havent paid us ok i want them to pay excuse me im not saying anything i dont talk im not like obama where he tells you everything hes going to do  were going to go and do this were going to go and do that i dont talk but theyre going to pay no no  yeah it sends a signal you know what signal it says it says were going to pay you know somebody said but we have treaties i said thats right and in the treaties theyre supposed to pay theyre going to pay and they will pay they will pay   yes   were going to have a whole policy on that over the next three weeks im going to be doing a big thing on that   well ive been doing very well with the hispanic community i mean really well i mean the  the poll numbers are going up very high i think we had one recently  or  but im going to have a whole  were going to have a news conference on that over the next three weeks so and i want to just tell you because these polls cover it so la times  cnn way up theyre all way up biggest  they say the biggest bounce in memory because today i heard a dishonest guy on television say well trump didnt get much of a bounce so you know i have to at least say jeremy go ahead   i dont think he respects clinton i dont think putin has any respect whatsoever for clinton i think he does respect me and i hope i get along great with him its possible that we wont jeremy i hope that we get along great with putin because it would be great to have russia with a good relationship right now we dont have a good relationship putin has said things over the last year that are really bad things ok he mentioned the n word one time i was shocked to hear him mention the n word you know what the n word is right he mentioned it i was shocked he has a total lack of respect for president obama number one he doesnt like him and number two he doesnt respect him i think hes going to respect your president if im elected and i hope he likes me yes yes sir   yes sir   but let me finish with jeremy go ahead   president trump would be so much better for usrussian relations you cant be worse hey look when i was a young men studying history and studying all of these things that ive always found fascinating one thing that ive always heard is you never want to do anything to unite russia and china well theyre united now in a true sense theyve never been closer theyre selling oil to china we forced them into this position   no wait a minute   no im not going to be an adversary no not at all i have tenants from china i have the biggest bank in the world from china paying me rent i mean i have great relationships with china im not blaming china for getting away with murder im blaming our leadership is incompetent we dont know what were doing  i dont blame  i respect china hey if china can get away with trade deficits every year of hundreds of billions of dollars  if they can get away with that my hats off to them i have no problem with china i have a problem with our incompetent leadership allowing that to happen and i believe that hillary clinton is even more bought and paid for than barack obama i think it will get worse its going to be four more years of obama which is unacceptable to a lot of people you see that but i believe that hillary clinton will be worse than obama yes   thats right   thats right im going to be doing something over the next four weeks very much so   no im prepared to say were gonna have a great plan one of the things i think because ive traveled all over the country and im going  you know where im going i guess you all know i dont have to say but im going to toledo  and im going to different places today and ive met so many people this is such a great country these are such great people one of the saddest things i see are college students that work so hard that go to colleges good colleges theyre good students they do a great job number one they get out they have no jobs because our jobs are going to mexico theyre going to china theyre going to japan theyre going all over the place theyre not coming here just like my friend who builds the plants but he doesnt build them here much and the saddest thing i see is these students are leveraged debt up to their  up to their neck they cant breathe theyre scared theyre so scared they have leveraged their entire life they have loans and i have to tell you the colleges are viewing the students as just a con to it because the students get government money passes through but the number gets higher and higher because college costs are out of control because the colleges say what difference does it make if you take a look at the salaries being paid you take a look at whats going on with the colleges because all of this is a pass through and the students are a con to it so the colleges are costing so much money we are going to help the students maybe that doesnt fit beautifully within the republican framework but i told this during various times to lots of different people and nobody has a problem with it we have to help our students our students are under tremendous pressure to a point where its making them sick our students are under tremendous pressure we have to help our students and im going to have a plan over the next four weeks    everythings on the table youll see everything  its a very important  its a very important subject yes maam   i think my message is resonating because they have confidence on me at the border if they dont want people pouring into our country likewise they have confidence with me on isis not only in terms of getting rid of them but also in terms of keeping them out of our country because i will not have people come into our country who want to do damage to our people i think they have a lot of confidence in terms of my bringing back jobs because i see carrier and i see ford and i see all of these companies leaving and going to mexico like theres nothing to it and then they make their product they sell it back to the united states no tax no nothing we get nothing except unemployment and i think people see that i can tell you i mean im like a pollster myself when im in front of these massive audiences one of the things that gets constantly  you people know because youre there  the biggest applause is a repeal and replacement of obamacare because obamacare is a disaster in texas going through bluecrossblueshield they just announced a  percent increase on november st youre going to have new numbers come out for obamacare having to do with increases president obama is trying to get it moved to december because it is electiondefying it is going to be a massive number the biggest number ever in our countrys history for health care its going to be announced on november st i just asked the press dont let him do that obamacare is a disaster people are dying with it its a disaster and everybody knows and its going to fold anyway in  unfortunately  if im president  i mean ive got to take over this mess its going to fold anyway but repeal and replace obamacare people like it they like the fact that im going to protect the second amendment they like the fact that im going to rebuild our military which is very depleted those are the things that are resonating and they dont feel hillary clinton can do it john  go ahead john    no i have nothing to do with russia john  how many times do i have say that are you a smart man i have nothing to with russia i have nothing to do with russia and even  for anything what do i have to do with russia you know the closest i came to russia i bought a house a number of years ago in palm beach florida palm beach is a very expensive place there was a man who went bankrupt and i bought the house for  million and i sold it to a russian for  million including brokerage commissions so i sold it so i bought it for  i told it for  to a russian that was a number of years ago i guess probably i sell condos to russians ok   of course i can i told you other than normal stuff  i buy a house if i sold it to a russian i have nothing to do with russia i said that putin has much better leadership qualities than obama but who doesnt know that   of course not i own the trump organization zero zero go ahead   i am   i did   i did because i would love to see a woman become president of the united states but she would be so wrong and even women say that women dont like her she would be so wrong look hillary clinton is a disaster shes been a disaster and even the story told by her husband last night he left out the most interesting chapter i wont get into that the chapter that i really waited for because it was pretty boring the chapter that i waited for i never heard and he left it out look hillary clintons a disaster id love to see a woman become president and itll happen absolutely but i think it would be bad for women if it were hillary clinton yes maam    yes i do   but i have spoken to about many times and i speak about it all the time and the police have to be very careful they have to be very very well trained i speak about it all the time in fact i mentioned the most recent death excuse me i mentioned the most recent deaths in louisiana and in minnesota i speak about it all the time its a real problem because if the police do  great jobs and they have one either a rogue policeman or a cop who was poorly trained or did a bad job you see that incident on television for weeks its a real problem you dont see the good work that they do but if they make one mistake out of  out of more than that its on television night after night after night the police in this country do an amazing job but likewise i agree and i do mention that all the time yes maam go ahead   oh go ahead go ahead   yes   no but they seem to be if its russians i have no idea its probably not russia nobody knows if its russia you know the sad thing is that with the technology and the genius we have in this country not in government unfortunately but with the genius we have in government we dont even know who took the democratic national committee emails we dont even know who it is i heard this morning one report said they dont think its russia they think it might be china another report said it might be just a hacker some guy with a  iq that cant get up in the morning ok nobody knows honestly they have no idea if its russia might be russia but if its any foreign country it shows how little respect they have for the united states yes maam   yes   well and  the biggest thing is number one we have to stop by keeping people out because these people theyve got something bad going on up there thats something really bad going on and then people in terms of islam and radical islamic terrorism a term that our president refuses to use i cant hes still not using it hes still not using it and she doesnt want to use it other than i forced her into maybe using it she said she will use it but so far she didnt  shell probably use it tonight like the american flags as soon as we put out a thing they ran a couple of american flags up in the stage it was a disgrace you had a room with a massive stage without flags i think this  i think that the people in the community know whats going on whether its in a mosque or whether its in the community and they have to report these people when you look at san bernardino people knew  many people knew what was going on they had bombs lying all over the floor they had bombs on the floor i mean this isnt  you walk into somebodys house there are bombs lying on the floor  i think theres a problem there you got to report it and by the way david hinckley should not have been freed ok david hinckley was just released  john hinckley  i think that john hinckley  excuse me john hinckley should not have been freed i just heard about it    thats up to the president let the president talk to them look heres the problem heres the problem katy  katy heres the problem very simple he has no respect   well they probably have them id like to have them released   no it gives me no pause if they have them they have them we might as well  hey you know what gives me more pause that a person in our government crooked hillary clinton  heres what gives me pause be quiet i know you want to save her that a person in our government katy would delete or get rid of  e mails that gives me a big problem after she gets a subpoena she gets subpoenaed and she gets rid of  emails that gives me a problem  now if russia or china or any other country has those emails i mean to be honest with you id love to see them    thats the most ridiculous conversation he never had the  don jr told me  let me just tell you let me save you a lot of boredom   mike pence will play a big role but i just want to tell you about john kasich i never spoke to him about being vice president we dont have good chemistry together i have never spoken to him about being vice president i would never pick him to be vice president there was never a conversation and he has a habit of doing things like this where he says things that may be a little bit shaky he never spoke  don jr would never  and that was so long ago i didnt even know i was going to get the nomination at that point just so you understand i would not have picked john kasich wouldnt be the right guy i mean for that to have gotten out that was so ridiculous and then i was going to put him in charge of national and worldwide policy so whats left for the president i think you know me better than that that was put out by him hes a nice man john kasich hes fine hes fine i would never have chosen him now i did speak to various people and i actually got acceptances from many people there are some people that called me that very much wanted to be vice president but i picked a man that i have a lot of respect for and mike pence is doing a great job let me just explain  i never asked john kasich to be vice president nor would i and by the way im leading in ohio by three points   it probably has it probably has our government is so weak on this stuff it probably has possible i mean i have a lot of checks and balance i have a good system i guess im not an e mail person myself i dont believe in it because i think it can be hacked for one thing but when i send an email i mean if i send one i send one almost never im just not a believer in email a lot of people have taught me that including hillary but honestly it could be maybe its hacked who knows   yes but my message wasnt dark my message was optimistic because were going to fix the problems go ahead   ok   no basis no basis look john i didnt have to do this when i did this believe me  you see this incredible resort its one of the great in the world when i did this i could be here enjoying myself i dont have to be with you guys i didnt need this i have places that are the best in the world ok i could be doing other things im doing this because were going to make america great again im doing this because when i looked at the iran deal which was incompetent  when i looked at whats going on with jobs being torn out of our country and going to mexico and china whats happening with china and with all of this with isis with our military being so badly depleted where we have old fighter jets we have to take parts from museums and from graveyards when i look at all this i say i sort of have to do it you know this countrys been great to me im giving back thats all now as far as running a campaign i guess its probably not typical but they said that against you know when i ran there was  people a total of  governors senators ben carson whos a fantastic guy capable people wait a minute everybody said oh he can never win because look what hes doing hes giving a talk to  people in new hampshire instead of going to everybodys house and having dinner and then i won new hampshire and then i won you know  or  states and won by the way not by a little bit won with the highest vote in the history of the republican party so just   ok but john but the point is this so its a different kind of a campaign but its what i think is good i think its good i think its working here too   well when joe biden says that i want to firebomb the enemy which was on television this morning or carpet bomb he used the term carpet bomb when he makes the statement that donald trump wants to carpet bomb i never said that that was ted cruz that said that ok that was ted cruz wasnt me when sanders and i think a lot of his people are going to come to me because of trade but when bernie sanders makes a statement that i wanted to go lower than the minimum wage lower its a lie so i have a choice all my people say dont respond to it it doesnt matter i say to me it does matter it matters when people tell lies politicians who tell lies very well thats what they do thats why theyre politicians but when politicians tell lies and im lucky in a sense because i have a big microphone in other words i can say that biden lied when he said that or i can say that i didnt say that bernie sanders and you guys know that i didnt in fact he was criticized by people that fact check for saying it because i never said it so its nice to be able to president obama said a yearanda half ago donald trump will never be president today on the today show he said this is democracy a little bit different little bit different  david go ahead dave   youll have to see it in the polls david you know what my positions are youll have to see it at the polls   yeah go ahead   david my positions are down you ask the question every single time i give you an answer my positions are down take a look go ahead   yes i did   we wanted to yeah i dont know what he said but we wanted   excuse me listen we wanted to we were doing miss universe  or  years ago in russia it was a tremendous success very very successful and there were developers in russia that wanted to put a lot of money into developments in russia and they wanted us to do it but it never worked out frankly i didnt want to do it for a couple of different reasons but we had a major developer particular but numerous developers that wanted to develop property in moscow and other places but we decided not to do it   yes maam go ahead   he did say that   well i just said sort of said that he just said that he said it this morning anythings possible i think im going to win i think people are sick and tired of incompetence theyre sick and tired of having politicians leading them down the tubes whether its taxes whether its debt whether its any one of  different things and thats why i mean i think ill win the election i think youll see that in the polls all right a few more questions go ahead john   i hope your arms ok   well its a tradition but i dont do things that are traditional but i have great support from israel i will back israel  percent i would like to go there but i have great relationships as you know to the people in israel and by the way obama in my opinion is the single worst thing politically speaking thats ever happened to israel he has been a disaster for israel   i dont know i dont know i havent set my schedule yet it could happen   no i think we  its possible we have but im not  im only interested in winning once i win ill get along great with foreign leaders but they wont be taking advantage i mean the problem we have with foreign leaders whether its china russia or anybody they dont respect our leadership and certainly in the case of china they take tremendous economic advantage of us  tremendous to a point that is hard to believe ill get along great with the leadership and well do well yes maam in the back   no no excuse me in the back   well be looking at that yeah well be looking go ahead   federal   right   im not making it a part but at some point maybe people will change their minds but as of right now im not making it a part ok   yes maam go ahead   who said that   who   i think president obama has been the most ignorant president in our history his views of the world as he says dont jive and the world is a mess you look at whats happening with the migration with syria with libya with iraq with everything hes touched he has been a disaster as a president he will go down as one of the worst presidents in the history of our country it is a mess and i believe that hillary clinton will be even worse go ahead   oh  just said that many polls show that you are winning i cant believe it are you katy turek  of nbc its a disguise go ahead    ok well     sure well youve been asking me a lot of questions for a lot of times ive turned out to be right i turned out to be right on nato after i said that on nato nato changed their whole program because of me excuse me katy hillary clinton said yesterday shes going to start renegotiating trade deals she never said that in her life she said it yesterday only because of me im the one thats prepared president obama when he became president he didnt know anything this guy didnt know a thing and honestly today he knows less today he knows less hes done a terrible job i think im very prepared now with that being said ive been a businessman all my life but ive been watching it ive been seeing it ive been feeling and as you know ive been very much involved in politics from the other side i understand politics or i guess i wouldnt be here i mean i beat a lot of very talented people   i do i have great foreign advisers and you have a list and i gave you a list and the other day as an example general quinn and general flynn and we have so many  we have so many as an example i had a meeting three or four days ago and im going to do a report on it with seven or eight very very talented advisers now with all of that being said a lot of people want the people that are doing it now people that have certain names look at the mess theyve gotten us into they said have you spoken to so and so well i said but he was in favor of the war in iraq many years ago which i was not in favor of have you spoken to this one or that one i said they were all  look at the job theyve done so a lot of the people that you think are good because you know their name or because you see them on television i dont think are good because look at the end result the end result is our country is a mess the middle east has never been worse had we done nothing with the middle east had our presidents with an s gone to the beach and relaxed wed be in better shape than we are right now all right tom a couple more go ahead tom   yeah   well well have to see i mean thats my opinion thats my opinion well have to see i have a real problem when hillary clinton who gives open access to a phony server is allowed to get these briefings how does hillary clinton get a national security briefing when shes been probably hacked when so much of her information the director of the fbi said it was essentially negligent it was negligent now why are they giving her briefings why are these people with great knowledge of the inner workings of our country and our security why are they giving hillary clinton briefings because its going to get revealed i mean her number one person huma abedin is married to anthony weiner whos a sleazeball and a pervert and im not saying that i mean thats recorded history right i dont like huma going home at night and telling anthony weiner all of these secrets ok so how can hillary clinton be briefed on this unbelievably delicate information when it was just proven that she lied and that her server shouldnt have had it and that theyre missing  emails and thats just the beginning so i dont think that i know at some point theyre going to be calling theyre going to want to brief me but im not a talker about this stuff i dont think that its safe to have hillary clinton in light of what just happened and in light of what we just found out i dont think its safe to have hillary clinton be briefed on national security because the word will get out   no hes not going to run for mayor oh don  hes not going to run for mayor don  has no attention of running for mayor but he did a great job the other night with his speech because he made a good speech everyone says he should run for mayor you know why because we have a democratic mayor whos horrible hes doing a horrible job de blasio but don  is not going to run for  he has no interest in running for mayor   yes   unbelievable what he said i think its disgraceful hillary clinton because of me said that tpp is not going to happen but we all know it is going to happen if she won terry mcauliffe said with a wink that if hillary gets in shes lying and it will happen and there is nobody closer i know this for a fact there is nobody including her own husband closer to hillary clinton than terry mcauliffe ok go ahead   oh i dont know what he said jon  i really  anthony weiners  look look look  anthony weiner is a proven loser i mean the poor guy hes locked up in a room they lock him up in a room they dont let him out i dont know what anthony  my son doesnt want to run for mayor he has no intention of running for mayor and besides that as a republican you have a very tiny sliver in manhattan as you know and in that area its almost impossible for a republican to win so and my son likes to win but my son has no intention of running for mayor so lets just put that to bed go ahead   yes in  very sad not    yes im looking at it i actually want to find out what causes it its a problem in many areas ok yes go ahead   well they shouted  you know what was interesting yesterday i made a speech in front of the great veterans as you saw and it was very well received she was there the day before and when i started talking about hillary clinton the veterans who saw her  hours before started screaming lock her up lock her up lock her up they also screamed that as you know during the speech i made the big speech  and i said dont do that now i didnt do that for any reason i really  i didnt like it and they stopped not one reporter said that i said that they all said  they started screaming lock her up lock her up i said dont do that nobody reported that i said that because its dishonest reporting you do agree i said that right   ok well why didnt somebody report that   no i think its  i think its a shame that they said it but a lot of people would say that should happen ok one more question yes  yes maam go ahead   well doral is great and doral  i think i have over  hispanics working at doral and theyre doing a great job yes maam in the yellow go ahead yellow   excuse me yellow   who   no i dont think it has any impact hes been very bad  her running mate has been very very bad on employment and all you have to do is go to virginia and speak to the people of virginia he has been so bad i figured when she chose him he was very popular in virginia they dont like him they dont like him it has been very close races and his polling is very bad so ladies and gentlemen thank you very much i think its time for hillary clinton to do a news conference because its almost a year now and it would be interesting to see how she does thank you all very much   might as well tell him to have a good time he has done one bad job ok thank you everybody"
40,"Trump","thank you whoa whoa this is amazing this is amazing usa thank you thank you  this is incredible you know i had a press conference before and one of the questions was mr trump what are you doing you are not supposed to be campaigning today you have broken all of the rules what is going on they are having their convention sir you are not supposed to be campaigning well guess what folks we are campaigning we are going to make america great folks we are going to make america great again remember that  and they said the same thing you know during the primaries we have  people very talented people and they said the same thing  this will never work because trump comes in he has these big rallies and then he leaves and im supposed to have dinner like with two people spend the entire evening they go to another  and they said well why do you do that i said well i do it because i can get to rallies the other people cant get to rallies its very simple  its very simple  but that worked i have to thank two people that have been unbelievable and great friends tom marino congressman wheres tom get up here tom get up here  and lou barletta get up here  oh there it is  lou lou lou  all right they have like big fences to cross just a minute ok we all know what you look like but they have been so great right from the beginning and i wan to thank  i want to thank you both i want to thank you both thank you i mean it  so its been an amazing  yeah sit down come on weve got plenty of time well we have nothing but time its a nice place  this is very nice first of all mike pence has been amazing  and you know one of the reasons and this is  percent one of the reasons i chose mike was because indiana under his leadership has done so well its done so incredibly  aaa bond rating they have really low unemployment one of the top few states everythings good even for the veterans in terms of employment i think it was  or  no thats not the good number that was when he got into office and when he left right now basically they were number two in the nation and he wants it to be number one thats incredible thats veterans being employed by some of the folks in this room so that was great  now when we won new york you know we had these incredible victories what do i know about politics but we do have a lot of common sense all of us dont we we know we know  we know a lot we know a lot i had a run that was incredible it started with new york and new york  and you know whats nice i won new york   queens queens youre right queens he knows what are you doing here what are you doing here  but we had this incredible period of time and we just kept winning winning winning but i went to new york and we had a massive landslide victory  won just about everything and in my victory speech i dont even know why i said it  but i said and were going to  this is in the middle of fifth avenue ok  were going to put the miners back to work i said that  i dont even know why and by the way that includes the steelworkers and were going to take a lot of the regulations off of gas because gas is big and they want to close you down they want to close the mines down theyve been closing mines down its sad its sad but little did i realize that shortly thereafter id go to a place called west virginia and did they love trump did you see those numbers  and hillary clinton  crooked hillary clinton shes really crooked  so hillary clinton  thank you      you know what were going to do even better were going to beat her on november th were going to beat her ok  thats even better ok thats what were going to do got to get out there we got to vote you got to get out there we got to get out there but do you remember  so hillary gave a press conference in an area where coal and the different things that we all love wasnt so important right and she figured shed make the statement and it wouldnt get back to west virginia it got back to west virginia and it got back to pennsylvania and it got back to ohio and it got back to a lot of places that she didnt want to hear that message she said were going to put the coal miners and were going to put the coal mines out of business ok no good and we had an event it was at a big massive place  it was beautiful  in west virginia and the place was packed it has to be   people and outside they had at least double that number and it was love and i went and saw some of the miners and i said so tell me would you ever think of like leaving and going to another place and maybe doing something else instead of this they said mr trump and i understand this so well we love mining we love doing it this is our livelihood our fathers our grandfathers  this is what we do we do it so well we dont want to do something else and i said i love that i love that i can understand it and i love that love it  so hang in because were going to put you back to work were going to put you back its going to be a beautiful thing to see because these are great people these are amazing people and so many from this area but so many from this state and i went to school in pennsylvania i love pennsylvania  you know i love pennsylvania and were just going to  you know when i look at  i look around and i see what happened i  i didnt need to do this i had a very nice life  beautiful family beautiful business i built this incredible company all this and i just couldnt stand  you look at the iran deal you look at so many  everything is wrong everything is wrong take a look ill tell you what lets talk take a look at the convention thats going on right now they dont honor  think of it they dont honor our police they dont honor our law enforcement we started complaining they had no american flags on this massive stage they had no american flags they forgot they forgot to put up  now we had a lot of flags  somebody said i cant see you mr trump there are too many flags i said thats ok well leave it that way but we had a tremendous success and we got a balance  that according to one of the networks that it was one of the biggest balances  that anyones seen  now i give a lot of credit for that to my family my family melania and tiffany  and ivanka and don and eric and they talk about these people they say stars stars id rather have those five stars much more so those fiveplus one by the way  but they did an amazing job and i have one of the stars with me should i introduce you to eric eric eric get over here eric come here  e  wow look at this crowd this is amazing well you know guys i had to come today i spent so much of my youth in scranton in coverdale and waverly so many of my best friends in the world  i went to boarding school in pennsylvania for five years and i just love this state i know this area as well as anyone and i just had to be here today we have so many great friends and thank you you know we just came off a convention and we had a great time it was honor to be up there and to talk about my father we had the greatest time we are so proud of him and we are going to make america great again we are going to win this in november we are going to make this country great again thank you very much guys d  that is my  boy and he is a good guy he is a good guy he loved this area he really did he loved the school he went to he went to the hills school he loved it and he did well he has been doing well i am very proud of my children i am very proud of my children so president obama today was interviewed on a show man look honestly if he did a great job as president i wouldnt care if he was a democrat republican or conservative i dont care if he did a great job as president i would be so happy and so would you i would be so happy it hasnt worked out that way it hasnt worked out that way we are scoffed at all over the world we are looked down upon all over the world we are not respected anymore we were talking about putin today  no respect no like no nothing you know wouldnt it be a great thing if we could get along with russia wouldnt that be a good thing that would be a good thing  not a bad thing it would be a good thing wouldnt it be a good thing if we could make deals trade deals with china that instead of loosing hundreds of billions of dollars a year and rebuilding chinas roadways and airports and tunnels that we did much better than we are doing right now you know i am a free trader i believe in it but you need smart people to make great deals we dont have the right people we are being ripped off on by every single country we do business with on trade every single country we do business with  we have people negotiating our deals that are political hacks these are deals that are so big  you know you could take a midsize country and the trade deals are bigger than the massive deals you read about with corporations these are bigger deals there is no bigger deals than the deals with china with trade its a one way street they take their product they flow it in  by the way for your steel workers they dump more steel in this place because theyre going to put you out of business you are already mostly out of business but they want to put you out of business we are going to start making things again folks we are going to start making things again that includes steel but we will start making things again  a friend of mine whos a manufacturer  hes a great manufacturer hes not a very political person which is probably good for him but hes a great manufacturer and he calls me up and he goes you know its really sad i work so hard to get into china i cant break in he cant get in its so hard then he finally gets in and he has to pay massive taxes on everything and they wanted to open up plants in china  were not going to let you do this anymore and im not even blaming china i think theyre doing the right thing for them but theyre killing us theyre killing us and its not going to happen anymore folks not going to happen anymore  and the problem is its a oneway street we pay tax they dont take our goods they make us build like crazy over there you look at boeing they order  planes they end up having to build a massive place over there they devalue their currency theyre grand grand masters theyre the greatest in the world ever japans good theyre all good were not good we dont know whats happening and its so easy to stop because they send their goods in and they send them in without tax and not going to happen so heres the story heres the story i won the state of indiana where i got to know mike pence  and one of the reasons i won  well maybe the biggest reason was bobby knight came out and he said you know we want trump right look at that we want trump but bobby knight was so great but one of the big reasons i won indiana was because carrier air conditioner announced  actually about a year before but i kept talking about carrier carrier i didnt know id need  you know it was going to be good for me it turned out to be good for me because every time i made a speech in indiana id have so many of these  people that got laid off they were in carrier for years some of them   years good people and one day and if i didnt have the cell phones  oh those cell phones where they take the pictures they had  it was all over the news somebody was taking a picture of this sort of midlevel manager saying listen were going to fire everybody and were moving to mexico just another case  but you know what its much more effective when you can see it lets say that same thing happened but we didnt have the picture of these people that were devastated they were devastated this has been their job for many years and its a good job you know the jobs we have arent good jobs anymore theyre bad jobs and even the opponents say theyre bad jobs so i go to indiana and ive been talking about carrier for a long time it got worse and worse and many others  this is just  in all fairness to carrier this is just one of hundreds and hundreds of companies that are moving out in this case going to mexico many of them go to mexico but in this case going to mexico so they announce theyre closing theyre going to fire everybody theyre going to move to mexico theyre going to make their air conditioners theyre going to sell them over here and thats it not anymore folks not anymore not anymore  not anymore so now when that happens and this can pertain to all of you were going to keep your companies and were going to bring a lot of companies back were going to bring our jobs back were going to bring our coal back and were going to have clean coal its clean coal and were going to have coal and that gas is going to be just a beautiful thing ok because they want to regulate you right out of business they want you out they want to stop that one now so what happens is this they think theyre going to go make their products sell it in everyones going to be happy so for years ive been watching even before this administration this beauty of an administration ive been watching and ive seen that they are always trying to stop people from  theyre trying to come up with plans  maybe low interest loans maybe zero interest loans i think they made a couple where they actually had the people  they gave them the money at zero interest or whatever and then they move because they forgot to say you cant move we are giving you money this is the people that we owe so here is the story here is the story its very simple im a free trader but when trade isnt fair and when things arent fair and when countries disrespect us we are going to be very firm very nice i get along great with leadership and i dont again im not angry at the leadership of mexico or japan or vietnam new strong vietnam or china i respect what theyre doing in what they have done is fantastic for them for us horrible so what we do is simple  i have watched for many years and it is so basic half of the people  and i know a few of the people here theyre great business people they are friends of mine they are friends of mine who came theres one right over here stand up albert where the hell are you albert stand up albert hes a good golfer but im actually a better golfer than him right i have a lot of friends in the room great friends here is what we are going to do  theyre going to make their products heres what they want to do they want to make their products send it in and sell it to indiana and every other place like nothing happen there is going to be consequences now so we tell them now if you get there early enough before they build the plant you say listen we are really happy you are moving to mexico we think it is wonderful very hot but it is wonderful but here is the story if you are going to move to mexico every single time you make an air conditioning unit we will charge you a  percent tax okay  we are not going to give you money or loan you money they dont need they dont need money they have plenty of money this has nothing to do with loans or anything so all these incentives that our government which is complicated  you know loaning money giving money and doing tax investments its not simple and i guarantee you  and i always joke it is fun for me and i love business i love it and i have an instinct for it i built an unbelievable company some of the greatest assets in the world i like it the only problem is as president i should not be making the call right i joked about this but i should not be calling the head of an air conditioning company right but we have to do it its like three minutes my wife would said you should not be calling the head of carrier air conditioning but i say but honey im telling you it is so easy i have some of the greatest business leaders in the world to endorse me carl icahn great business leader and so many others the reason they listen is because they know what i am doing and so whats happen is this i get a call okay the worst i will have one of my workers  call one of the people you would not like very much but who cares you would wouldnt want them out for dinner some of them are nice but most are rather ruthless and vicious but that is who i want negotiating i dont want our political hacks negotiating i want these guys a few i have to do myself because it is fun so we call then and he will go yes mr president it is great honor talk to you  its a great honor to talk to you also listen youre moving i understand that you are leaving you are going from indiana to mexico right  yes well i hope you change your mind  well sir we wont now you have to understand i will be hit by every lobbyist and every special interest group in america in order to not make the call in order to let the deal die like hillary rodham clinton hillary rodham clinton so  crooked hillary so  so look heres the story  so normally politicians   so theyre going to be calling right theyll call and theyll talk and they say you know this and that and theyll say madam president i dont want to hear that i do want to hear it eventually because i want to see a woman become president but it cant be her shes a disaster  shes a disaster shell set you back a long way women if that happens itll be a long way before it happens again you better be careful what you wish for so heres the story theyd say to hillary  theyd say you cant do that they gave you  million or you cant do that your lobbyist paid you a fortune and raised millions of dollars or your  shell go youre right i cant really do that and thats the end of it ok thats the end so they move to mexico theyll sell their goods we have our  people unemployed and im talking about times thousands times thousands of jobs millions of jobs million of jobs now heres the difference me they call i dont care who is it i know half of these guys anyway i dont care what do i want to take his call for ok does nothing for me you know i spent  billion  dollars so far in my campaign right  and im spending  last week  last month i guess it was  somebody said  i thought it was two million and they said it was  million its really good when you dont know that its  right  no i thought i put up two  something and i said oh will you put up two million it was actually  million and i said to myself you know its great when you can put up  million instead of two million and you dont care thats the way it is i dont care i dont care  and im continuing but im raising a lot of money were raising a lot of money for the republican party and its coming in big league and its coming in in small doses and thats something no other republicans going to be able to do mike pence was just saying its an amazing thing we raised like  million dollars for a partial month last month and were doing equally well this month of  and i think the average price was  the average cost was like  or  something like that and that doesnt happen that happens for bernie sanders because its a different kind of mentality and thinking and by the way poor bernie poor  he just wants to go home and go to sleep please  no he wants to go to sleep who can blame him who can blame him  who can blame him he wants to go home did you see he left very early last night hes exhausted but were going to get the bernie people out of him a lot more than people think because i know the trade he was right about one thing trade he said were being screwed on trade and hes right  hes right whats happening with trade is right i will talk about it a little bit more then were going to talk about the border were going to talk about our depleted  you know little things but look bernie really hurt his legacy because if he wouldve gone all the way and if they wouldve had some kind of a march and then he goes and he goes back to being  i think its a lot better than the way he sold out to hillary clinton he sold out he sold out  i mean other than trade  and the problem is he knows trades no good the difference is ill do something about it big league because i like the trade but weve got to make great deals somebody said to me well are you a freetrader yes are you a fair trade yes im everything i could name  different forms of trade i know every one of them hey the wharton school of finance right here in this great state right but  but the best school best school number one best school ok so heres the story so i can name all of them so one of these characters back here  look at all of them you know for a group of people that said why are you campaigning   boy do we have a lot of people back there you know what for a group of people that asked me this morning sir this isnt traditional that you would be out on the stump why are you campaigning man a hell of a lot of people showed up for this didnt they and look at it  unbelievable  unbelievable isnt it unbelievable by the way i have to tell you they are the most dishonest human beings youll ever meet i really mean it  the most the most dishonest human beings you will ever meet    so especially if youre like a republican or conservative its forget it its forget it these are really bad people now  percent of them are fine  percent are not great and  percent are among the worst people you will ever encounter in your life  they lie they lie they lie  you know the story where they never show the size of the crowds they never do it they never do it unless a protest  you know i dont have protesters people are so  i always say the safest place you can be is at a trump rally  its the safest place  the safest place  true true  so were going to bring it all back its going to all come back its going to come back bigger and better than youve ever seen it before youre going to have jobs flowing in believe me youre going to have the carriers of the world say i think im not going to leave because now were playing with a different kind of mentality theyre not going to leave because theyre going to say were not leaving now if they want to go to another state thats different youve got to all sort of negotiate with each other good luck folks good luck  our congressman good luck but you know when they start leaving our country for another country because were the stupid people thats not going to happen ok thats just not going to happen so if you look at whats going on right now in a place not so far away a place that i happen to love called philadelphia i love it youve got people that are fighting and trying to make their point and they dont know whats happening because remember when i ran and everybody said well trump won like all of these people all these professional politicians and some very good people like ben carson whos great he endorsed me  great people  but very capable people and i wrote it down they have these signs ok they havent mentioned isis they dont want it mentioned why because they created it so they dont mention isis i told you before they dont mention our police or our law enforcement and they wouldnt have those doors open for two minutes if it werent for the police  they wouldnt have them open for two minutes  right they wouldnt have them open  their new name which is the joke of all time is that crooked hillary is a change maker do you see change you know they probably paid  million to the guy who came up with that slogan and i came up with crooked hillary all by myself zero no money but change maker  shes a change maker so shes been doing this for like  years plus and shes going to be a change maker right shes not going to change because the special interests and her lobbyists will never ever let her change believe me they will never let her change even if she wanted to and she doesnt want to  okay look at tpp so tpp transpacific partnership right a horrible deal that she was totally in favor of she said it was the gold standard not long ago its the gold standard of trade deals well remember this the worst deal ever signed from an economic standpoint in the history of our country right its nafta it was signed by who bill clinton who by the way gave a speech last night but he didnt mention my favorite chapter he left one chapter out  i met a girl i met a girl you know its funny when he started the speech last night he said i met a girl and i said thats politically incorrect and i saw rachel maddow give him hell over that its not a girl but he said it i met a girl and a lot of people thought that was nice but i said watch and rachel maddow knocked the hell out of him because he said i met a girl its supposed to be i met a woman i dont know maybe we will fight for him on that one right and didnt he say i then grabbed her and i said this is getting a little crazy now whats going on  i grabbed her  and then when he said that i knew that my favorite chapter would happen  and it didnt happen he didnt talk about the kinds of things we want to hear about but what are you going to do so look heres the story they call her a change maker shes not a change maker she wants to keep it just the way it is because its a rigged system she was very very disloyal now the last person that i like is debbie wassermanschultz this person is a disaster and she has been for a long time we will take our reince priebus any day right we will take him reince priebus is a great guy and hes done a great job and we had a great convention and ill tell you what cleveland did a fantastic job they did a fantastic job  but think of how disloyal hillary clinton was to debbie think of it this was her  crooked person this was a dishonest person this was a person that was rigging the system for her she rigged the system  carson never had a chance his people never had a chance i knew that i was saying  im the one that came up with the term rigged system and i said it a year and a half ago pertaining to my system and frankly had i not won all of these states by massive landslides i wouldnt be standing here youd have some stiff  and thered be  people in the office you know what youd have a different kind of a guy thered be about  people sitting in the first row our two congressmen wouldnt be here theyd say we dont want to be here itd be a whole different thing and youd be down  points instead of up seven in the state of pennsylvania right  right thats the way it is but heres the thing im a loyal person when cory  had a problem i was loyal i stuck with her everyone said cory  should be fired why i looked at her tape what happened im a loyal person ok im a loyal person youve got to be loyal to people if they do nothing wrong now in her case she did a lot wrong but she did it  you know she knew hillary clinton knew what she was doing she knew the system was rigged as soon as she got caught because the emails came out  and as soon as she got caught hillary clinton said youre fired get her out of here get her out of here thats what we have its weakness its disloyalty and this woman  she wanted so hard  remember she went the other day in front of the florida delegation oh did they rough her up but she deserves it look shes a dishonest person she deserves it but she rigged the system against bernie in favor of hillary and hillary dumped her like so fast so fast like ive never seen before and thats not what its about loyalty can be a wonderful thing and in this case i thought it was incredible what happened now the things that were on those emails were incredible you talk about race religion women by the way if i ever said the things that are on those emails i wouldve been run out of town and probably had i gotten the nomination i wouldve been forced to come to scranton stand right here and say im getting out of the race they were the worst things and theyre trying to sluff  them off theyre trying so hard to sluff  them off and then i see her campaign manager  i dont know young guy nice guy who knows and hes on television and he said that russia hacked them  what no no he said russia hacked them im trying to think of how does he know that right so he goes  i think it was one of the sunday talk shows right and he goes russia hacked them and then goes like  i said how does he know he didnt really know but he said russia  i could  and then he said trump trump yeah trump im sitting there watching im saying what did i do what did i do  what did i do  what trump i wish i had that power man that would be power so he talks about russias hacking the only thing he didnt say is what was on the emails was   thats what the problem is what was on the emails was the horror  but ill never forget it im sitting im watching every  you know falling asleep hes a boring guy  and he said russia with emails  probably was china or somebody else might be a pound person sitting in bed ok might be some of the greatest hackers of all time  but he said russia and then he said trump and i  it reminded me of jon lovitz you ever see the liar jon lovitz right in saturday night live yeah yeah i went to harvard harvard thats right this was like  yeah russia hacked yeah yeah it was trump trump thats  id say whoa what now these are lying bad people folks these are bad bad people these are bad bad people and theyre incompetent people and we want to turn our country around we want to make great trade deals we want to have strong borders we want to have the wall we want the wall were going to have the wall because were going to stop drugs from pouring into our country and people from pouring into our country  we want the wall  all right ill give you a quiz do you want the quiz whos going to pay for the wall   who    percent  percent you know i have these clowns and you can hold it  just i mean honestly you hold me to it i have these clowns in the back these pundits and theyre saying mexicos never going to pay for the wall mexico  do you know how much money they make from us each year and im not including with the drugs im leaving that out no which really is a terrible thing because when i won new hampshire the new hampshire people were unbelievable  my first victory was in new hampshire where by the way i hear i have a seven point lead you know  you know ive got to tell you its funny i have people politicians theyre running and some of them embraced me like these two characters ok but some of them said oh trump hes too controversial and then i run i dont care if they  you know if they endorse me or not it doesnt make any difference to me i think i do better  i might do better without endorsements but i have states  the great rob  stand up rob will you please take a bow for two seconds  so and if i dont win this state youll never be standing up again  that i can do mike you better believe it so i have these politicians and theyre running you know theyre senators and they say no no we dont want anything to do with trump  controversial do you endorse well we support him please dont ask me that question then the poll comes out where im leading that senator whoever it may be by a hell of a lot and all of a sudden we love mr trump hes great for america this is what we deal with folks ok this is what we deal with but in new hampshire ive got a nice lead supposedly i mean a poll came out seven points eight points more  something like that a very good lead were doing well were doing well in states and remember this if a person on the stage with me and i speak well of all of them now because it would be nice if the party unified i dont think it matters from my standpoint i really dont i dont think it matters but it would be nice i dont know why but it would be nice because we have to win but i will say this we open up states meaning me meaning you you know were together im a messenger im a messenger thats all i am believe me believe me  im a messenger  its what i am thats what i am you know i was using this phrase for the last couple of months and i use it again america first i use another one  but i use another one i use another one the forgotten man now i have to add and woman but there is an whole thing going around its called the forgotten man its the forgotten men and women we have forgotten men and women who work hard who are making less money than they made  years ago who are working much harder than they worked  years ago and now their older they cant afford their health insurance  who hate looking at whats happening they cant stand the fact that a priest in france has his throat cut and he lies dying on the ground they cant stand the fact that we are letting thousands and thousands and thousands of people pour into our country from areas of the world we are going to have problems like youve never seen i am very good at prognostication folks youre seeing that everything ive said has all come true pretty much and hillary clinton wants  percent more than obama  of people coming in from that area of the world we dont have documentation we dont have paperwork we dont really know who they are ive spoken to the best law enforcement people in this country and they say there is really no way of saying who they are and where they come from okay they even stole our passport machine did you see that they stole our passport machine some of people theyre going to cause problems and with me were going to do safe zones were going to help people were going to get the gulf states to pay because i dont want to pay with our country we are  trillion  and is going to be  trillion very soon  we are going to build safe zones and we are going to get the gulf states that we protect they wouldnt be there  they have nothing but money and theyre going to pay for this and we are going to build them in syria and were going to take care of people but you know what were not going to pay for it because we cant pay for it this isnt  years ago this isnt  years ago this is now and we are going to make our country so strong and were going to renegotiate our military deals you know im taking a lot of heat where they say nato  all i said is we have many countries there are  countries in nato right there are five that are paying their way the others  you dont get it straight they say back there donald trump doesnt like nato well i think its great i just said it was obsolete wolf blitzer on cnn asked me a question hes fine he said what do you think of nato you have to understand i have been a businessman but i have good common sense in business and so i said nato is obsolete because its not covering terrorism and everybody smiled and laughed and thought it was funny three days later they are now saying trumps right its not covering terrorism and then a few weeks later check out the wall street journal a few weeks later front page says nato to open up terrorism division i said great and to appoint the great guys one of their good guys who knows who the heck knows if hes any good we need your help father so that was right then i said the second thing so i said its obsolete so theyre working on that i like it i think nato is fine but we have to adjust you cant go so many years with no adjustments so now they have that i also said because i heard this that people arent paying their fair share theyre not paying their way and then these stupid people they say but we have a treaty they said what would happen if russia or somebody attacks i said  i dont know have they paid have they paid have they paid tell me have they paid well they havent paid well they said we have a treaty well i said they have a treat too that they have to pay we are going to end up in world war iii protecting people  and these people cant pay we are going to protect them  and theres an article right here that says  cover trump is right five countries out of  are paying their way so i want them to pay and heres the story they will pay if asked by the right person theyll pay theyll pay and hillary clinton said we will protect our allies at all costs well how the hell can you get money if youre going to say that and we need money we have massive massive deficits we need money  we need money so it sounds cold it sounds terrible and then tonight youll listen to obama saying donald trump wants to give up nato he doesnt say it right i want to keep nato but i want them to pay i dont want to be taken advantage of we dont want to be the stupid people anymore ok  we dont want to be the stupid people anymore were protecting countries that most of the people in this room have never even heard of and we end up in world war three and the country  you know just come on give me a break now if they live up to their obligations as they should  and by the way if they do that theyll have more spirit in a certain way ok but they have to pay same thing with japan and germany can you believe  a lot of people  before i ran did anybody know that we were protecting and paying for a large portion of the protection of japan which sells us cars by the millions and germany and saudi arabia and south korea we sort of knew because we have  soldiers on the border so i said here it is youve got to pay  got to pay so i talk about japan love japan many friends in japan great country they sell us cars i mean you talk about ripoffs you want to see a trade imbalance we sell them wheat they sell us cars we sell them beef and they dont even take the beef because their farmers say we dont want american beef right even though its the greatest beef in the world they dont want it they dont want it  so we sell them beef they sell us cars its the greatest trade imbalance youve got to see it its like the floor is us the ceiling is japan were not doing anything about it we dont do  but on top of it we protect japan so a general gets on sent obviously by obama and he said mr trump doesnt understand he knows nothing about defense i know more about offense and defense than they will ever understand believe me believe me than they will ever understand than they will ever understand  so i said  and this is a general now if he says this number its actually lower he said doesnt he understand that japan pays for  percent of its production and its  of the work we do ok they pay for  percent of the defense that we give them of the military protection that we give them so the newspaper calls up and they say mr trump sir they pay for  percent of the military i say why arent they paying for  percent of their  why  and the reporter goes oh never thought of that they dont think of that stuff and germany who has a mercedes half the people in the room  but look  but look germany now i dont mind and i understand all the reasons why and we dont want them to arm and all that stuff but you know the man that we know so well whos always threatening everybody in the region north korea if he all of a sudden gets a little more frisky than just words we end up in a massive war protecting somebody now heres our treaty with japan again i love japan i respect japan i respect what theyve been able to negotiate i think its great but heres our treaty with japan if they get attacked we have to protect them essentially world war three right if we get attacked they dont have to do anything ok they dont have to do anything no good no good then theyll say donald trump  youll hear it tonight they have all these guys lined up  donald trump doesnt know about  i know so much now if we  and i actually saw it today on television i saw a couple of people they called me  one guys calls me  hes a teacher at a big college could i come up to your office with my students i said oh this is just what i want oh im so busy he comes up i treat him nice its a while ago  comes up treat him nice take pictures with all these students yeah yeah yeah  goes back then i see him on television today  i know nothing about  because i cannot tie the fact that theyre not paying into the  why why am i right i mean you know give me a break so people agree with me but they dont tell you the story a lot of them said headlines donald trump doesnt like nato he wants to get out of nato they dont say what were talking about so when they hear what theyre talking about everybody says you know youre right so right in a headline in a major newspaper two days ago five countries out of  are paying their way the rest of them arent some are paying nothing because theres nobody to ask them theres nobody to ask them so were not going to be the stupid country anymore were not going to be led by stupid people anymore and were going to do such  i mean think of this i had a moment where i said were going to renegotiate nafta everyone said oh thats terrible i  whats wrong with renegotiating right were going to renegotiate the nafta deal its draining our jobs  everyone said oh donald trump wants to renegotiate hes against free trade i just want good deals thats all i want but all i want is good deals call him whatever you want right but there was a big story  donald trump is going to renegotiate nafta isnt that terrible i said let me ask you a question so im a good negotiator so we get in a room with these folks i tell them pretty tough stories because i mean it because you always have to be prepared to walk you have to be you cannot go into a negotiation unless youre prepared to walk im prepared to walk from a bad deal as a bad deal anyway so im prepared you guys are i guarantee it prepared to walk youve lost half of your businesses i mean im not going to go into it but i look at scranton  pennsylvania has lost one in three manufacturing jobs right look at these numbers look at these numbers look at these numbers scranton has lost  percent of its manufacturing jobs since bill clinton signed nafta its not  this is just   percent of your manufacturing jobs so i dont think youll be hard to convince i mean youre smart people but look why would anybody be upset about wanting to renegotiate deals make them better why would anybody care so i say i want to renegotiate nafta and every  the newspapers   the newspapers they say thats terrible and im trying to figure out why they have the national review and some of these conservative groups  he wants to renegotiate this he says were losing a fortune on these deals so if i negotiate these deals and i make them from bad deals to good deals and maybe even great deals why would anybody be upset theyre upset about it i dont get it but i dont care because ill do it ok im going to do it but  but nobody understands now today or yesterday hillary clinton said first time ever in her life right i am going to renegotiate trade deals not one mention of my name in the article not one mention not one mention tpp gold standard right she had the gold standard she then saw me on television knocking the hell out of it because they dont  they dont talk about currency manipulation and devaluation they dont talk about many of the problems plus you know what i want to make a deal not a massive number of countries i want to make a deal oneonone individual countries nice and simply nice and simple nice and simple  one two three you we dont like youre bad four fix no good six these deals are so complicated so its a page document that the only people in congress that read are our two congressmen and i promise you they didnt read them either ok dont worry  so this is a page document that nobody read remember obamacare remember when obama came out it was thousands of pages and they went to congress and nobody read it and then you had the wise guy from one of the good schools and he said it was a con job he said it was a con job and everybody was going to just go after that guy and you know what happens a couple of weeks go by theyll forget but i remember and i  i will bring it up remember the guy he said that obamacare was a con job remember that it was all a big con and two weeks go by and they  sort of fades and then four weeks go by its over but its not over with me so heres the thing i want to do individual countries because what happens is when you do a lot of countries number one too complicated you have all  youve got to see the lines on this thing i looked at it   pages youve got to see the things its here here here its like the craziest thing impossible and if the country  one of the countries is bad you cant get out because its such a complicated web i want to make trade deals with individual countries nice and simple nice and beautiful nice and beautiful  and if the country misbehaves or takes advantage of us like they always do we just send them a notice sorry heres your day notice ok were breaking off  and you know what theyll do theyll call up and  what do we have to do to keep it going ok well make a better deal its what we do so look folks we are going to make this country so strong again were going to build up our military its totally depleted were going to build a wall were going to take care of our veterans our veterans are our great people were going to take care of our veterans  were going to take care of our vets theyve been forgotten so many people have been forgotten  thank you thank you thank you thank you i just ask you this one thing i didnt need this and neither do you sitting in this room is about  degrees ok the only good thing is you lose a lot of weight  but look what i ask you is this you have to go november th and you have to vote or weve just all wasted our time  this is a movement but its only really a movement if we win i  i tell the story a lot about people that tell me what youve done has never been done in politics before and all that stuff i say no it doesnt mean anything if i knew that i wasnt going to win i wouldnt even waste my time doing it i wouldnt waste my time they said no no in terms of history what youve done has never been done i said it doesnt mean a thing unless we win ok doesnt mean a thing because we cant do what were going to do  and its so simple were going to make thing fair were going to make things fair so i only asks you one thing get every person you know we have to win the state of pennsylvania and i cant believe she has many fans here  i cant believe she has many fans here i dont believe she has many fans here and the miners and the steel workers and the executives and the professors weve got them all we have to get out there we have to vote we cant sit back because this is a really vital state and youre going to see because shes got a billion dollars to blow and shell put on these crazy ads much of which is wrong id go into it but i dont want to even bother but theyre wrong theyre false but shes going to put on all these ads and you know what theyre false ads thank you darling i love you too look at her i love them  but look look thank you shes going to put ads you know when i was running in florida i won in a landslide i went through two weeks of ads i was down there i said this is the most incredible thing ive ever seen you couldnt see  i was dying to see an ivory soap ad  but there wasnt because trump was  all negative ads and i won in a massive landslide so somehow people understand the truth because theyre really phony ads and false ads and vicious but heres the story come november th you have to get out and vote because it is a movement and its a movement like nobodys seen theyre talking about it all over the world were on the cover of time magazine every two hours many covers of time magazine because of whats happened and you know my whole life ive been on time magazine i think a couple of times my whole life not so bad and the last number of months i think its six or seven times right thats pretty good so you tell me whats more important real estate or politics right but what really is more important is making america great again and thats what were going to do  i love you thank you very much get out and vote november th i love you thank you thank you"
41,"Trump","thank you thank you thank you very much thank you very much i have to tell you that the fire marshall  they turned away thousands of people they turned away  thank you very much they turned away thousands of people  look at the size of this place they turned away thousands they were giving orders that no more than a thousand people now hillary clinton i have a picture here which is pretty sad  she had she had last week or a couple of days ago look at  totally empty  but is the mayor a democrat is there a democrat over here thats what i heard he ought to be ashamed of himself they turned away thousands of people but that makes it better for you right  its very sad you know it shouldnt be so much about politics folks were gonna do a town hall so were gonna be talking about questions and this and that ill say a few words but outside i met two gentlemen from piketon who really were misrepresented very badly very badly by president obama and theyre gonna come up come up fellas i just met them  because were gonna bring back our jobs were not gonna let our jobs go to mexico and all these other countries were gonna renegotiate the horrible nafta deal which is maybe the worst deal every made from an economic development standpoint  im not just talking in this country im talking about in the world  were gonna bring back our jobs and were also gonna stop radical islamic terrorism were not letting the people come in were not letting them come in and they can play all the games they want but were not  you know hillary clinton wants a  percent increase from syria coming into this country over obama and youd actually say what is she doing so heres a letter from president obama to these two gentlemen that have worked so hard and are having a hard time and maybe in just a little while you could just say exactly whats going on    thank you both very much same old stuff politicians all talk no action wont happen and you know hillary will be nothing more than four more years of obama four more years of isis four more years of a military thats being depleted and not taking care of our vets she said a few months ago our vets are being taken care of just fine she said no no its overexaggerated i know the vets i think i have tremendous support with the vets raised a lot of money and gave a lot of money to the vets i will tell you something the vets are not being taken care of well at all the suicide rate is hard to believe even when you hear the numbers and you know the numbers im talking about they wait in line for two three four five days  think of it going to a doctor and waiting for five days  longer than that  and people are dying waiting in line so were gonna take care of our vets were going to again secure and very important were gonna secure our borders were gonna secure our borders  were gonna build the wall were gonna build the wall and mexicos gonna pay for the wall and the reason  some of the politicians have said you know theyre not going to pass it no no you dont understand theyre going to pay they are making so much money mexico  theyre taking our business  a friend of mine builds plants thats what he does plants if he had to build an apartment he wouldnt know where to begin but he builds massive plants among the biggest in the world and i said to him recently how are you doing he said unbelievable now hes from this country and hed like to do well in this country but i said how are you doing he said unbelievable i said thats good so youre doing a lot of work in the united states not so much i said well how are you doing unbelievably you wouldnt believe whats happening in mexico its the eighth wonder of the world thats what he told me i said what does that mean he said theyre building among the biggest plants weve ever built its unbelievable companies are moving out of the united states  columbus by the way  theyre moving out of the united states theyre moving out of ohio i asked him theyre moving out of michigan big league  the cars  he builds car plants he builds computer plants builds them all and theyre moving out of the united states so i said hows the united states doing he says not so good he said but mexico is the eighth wonder of the world thats going to end folks we want mexico to do fine but were not going to let them take our jobs anymore were not going to let it happen you look at this area i mean i have statisticians right  good statisticians  they love to do this i cant imagine doing it and being too much fun to me it would be a little bit boring to do but ill tell you the numbers are horrendous first of all i dont know if you just saw the number for growth of our country did you see that growth   percent  percent were sinking were sinking thats one of the lowest numbers ever i think its the lowest number ever in terms of trying to make a comeback  percent but in columbus  and i looked at this and this is bad this is bad  ohio has lost one in three manufacturing jobs since bill clinton signed nafta bill clinton signed it and hillary clinton wants it  think of that hillary clintons disastrous trade policies are responsible for the manufacturing job losses in ohio and throughout the other states of this country ive got  a machine and ill tell you the problem with a machine it totally controls the press you look at cnn its called the clinton news network all day long trump trump  all day long cnn trump trump such a bad guy i just want to bring back your jobs i want to bring back your safety because were not safe  percent more people coming in from syria and other territories and we have no idea who they are and ive gone to the best law enforcement officials and they said theres no way of you telling they have all sorts of false things you know they stole our passport machine you saw that they make passports better than we do ok they have  think of it  percent more than  obama hes letting in thousands and thousands of people the people in ohio the people in the rust belt  and they call it the rust belt for a reason because everythings rusting and rotting you lost your jobs theyre moving to mexico remember my friend with the plant when youre going to vote remember this november   when you go to vote remember my friend with the plant where he says its the eighth wonder of the world and were going to renegotiate  if you want unless you dont want to do this were going to renegotiate nafta and it was very funny the other day i saw hillary clinton saying  first time ever  we are going to start renegotiating our trade deals thats been me for years thats been me number one she wont do a good job of it for a lot of reasons but one of them is that shes totally controlled by the special interests and ill give you an example i just saw this number just read it coming up here donald trump has raised  from hedge funds now i dont know how it got in there i dont even want it ill send it back hillary clinton from hedge funds has raised  million think about it  million i hope you dont own  i have a friend hes very wealthy he doesnt own a hedge fund but raised  million  i have  i think ill send the  back probably a nice person but think of it but heres really whats important to me so i funded as you know my primary people were very happy im continuing to fund my general election but were also taking small donations which in the primary wasnt a big factor because we didnt really  we sold hats and things little things it was cute and people like it and people put in small money but i funded it and i guess im into everything for  million or over  million or soon will be over  million but im continuing to fund my campaign but were also raising money from people where they send in a check small donors right youve sent in a check who sent in a check wow whoa thats fantastic so we only started last month and shes going to have like a fortune shes going to have like a billion billion and a half because shes going to be totally controlled like we talk about uranium  the two gentlemen great people  well she had a lot to do with russian uranium you saw that deal and got paid a fortune for allowing russia to come in  talk about uranium thats big stuff ok got paid a fortune and well be talking about that during the campaign dont worry about it but  so we started really around the middle of june and we had a tremendous june and they were saying donald trump didnt raise any money well we didnt start we started in the middle of june and we raised i think it as  million from the small donors that was around  some odd dollars apiece and we also raised from other people about  i dont know the total was about  million ok that was in june we hardly  that was like for half a month because people want to see something happen with our country but heres whats really good news this is just going to be reported i think today or tomorrow we have raised with the small donor  million think of that i believe its  donors think of that thats in a month  so we raised  million even a little more than that and the average price of the donation was  how incredible is that right  and its not even to me the money its to me the concept  in all fairness bernie sanders was doing that you know because there was some movement now it was a movement on the other side of the plate but you know what he had one thing in common with me he knew that the trade deals are destroying our country the difference is he couldnt do anything about the trade deals ill take those trade deals and make them so good thats what i do i love taking bad deals and making them good thats what i do i take bad deals and make them good naftas a bad bad bad deal and im gonna make it good  but think of that so we raised  million an excess of that in a month and then in addition we raised money that hasnt been tabulated yet from people that are putting up larger numbers but thats going to the republican national  largely  to the republican national committee and  im  and im putting up money to run my campaign ok so when you see  when you see that clinton crooked hillary crooked  shes crooked as a three dollar bill let me tell ya she is crooked when you see crooked hillary with  million from hedge funds and trump at  when they call me because they wanna stop a company from doing something or when they call me because they want one of your companies to get the green light to move into mexico and fire everybody believe me im gonna take care of these  im gonna do whats right for you shes gonna do right for her donors im gonna do right for you so its gonna be a big difference  its gonna be a big difference so  so ill just tell you were battling a lot of things but were battling the press because the press is very dishonest ok the press is very dishonest so  so as an example as an example i gave a very good answer over the weekend to one of the shows  on russia going into the ukraine i said very simply theyre not gonna do it on my watch essentially i said russia will not go into the ukraine now i said that and the next day the story comes out and we really let it roll a little bit actually i think it was usa today a couple of them covered it accurately what i said but a couple of paper said donald trump doesnt realize that the crimea was already taken i know it exact  two years ago approximately ok approximately it was taken during obamas watch so when i said believe me russias not going into ukraine all right theyre not going into ukraine the person said but theyre already in ukraine i said yeah well that was two years ago thats  thats  i mean you wanna go back you wanna have world war iii to get it back that was during obamas watch so during obamas watch  you know all the tough guys statements right so he talks about donald trump is not strong on russia first of all i have to say this wouldnt it be great if we actually got along with russia am i wrong in saying that wouldnt it be great  ok you know russia like us has nuclear weapons folks it would be really nice if we got along with russia and others that we dont get along with right now and wouldnt it be nice if we teamed up with russia and others including surrounding states and maybe nato and we knocked the hell out of isis and got rid of these people  wouldnt that be nice right  but  but even beyond that even beyond that putin said some very good things about me people say oh trumps going to be weak with putin because putin is saying nice things about me ok all right  and i said hes a strong guy they immediately say oh trump likes  but look i dont like or dislike i just say it this way wouldnt it be great if the united states and russia got along combined knocked out isis maybe did other positive things you know we forced them through stupidity into an alliance with china you know why because of oil because china needs oil we were driving both crazy they formed  and from the time i was young guy ive always learned dont ever let china and russia get together  we forced them together obama forced them together because you didnt get along with either and they eventually  china came in and said lets make a deal on oil theyre together in fact theyre doing naval exercises together someplace and you look at china theyre building one of the largest military installations in the world right smack in the middle of the south china sea and then they talk about donald trump and russia or donald trump but  believe me folks somebody can say nice things about me  he did call me a genius but these are minor details  somebody can say nice things about me  it has  it makes no difference it makes no difference all right i have been dealing a long time a lot of times i will make much better deals with people that say terrible things about me i dont care what they say about me i want the deal you know on trade one of the people thats standing back there  one of the dishonest media  well whats your definition of trade i said well your fair trade  you have all sorts  you have so many different types of trade but here is my definition of trade because right now we are being ripped off   billion trade deficit with china   billion and they give us product we let them in no tax no nothing you want to try and make a deal with china you cant get your product in and if you do you pay tax and if you do you also have to build plants over there and they dont even want that they dont want you in theyre onesided deals so when they said whats your trade deal i said very simply i want to make great deals for the united states we dont have to name it you have fair trade you have all sorts of names i learned every single one of them in college now we have added a couple here is the problem we have stupid people doing our negotiating we have stupid people doing our negotiating ill give you an example if a company in ohio said theyre going to leave were going to fire  which as you know many companies are leaving  and by the way as you are sitting here right now  right now we have companies negotiating with mexico and other places to close up in ohio and to move into mexico or other places ok as youre sitting here right now some of you people think you have good jobs guess what carrier thought they had good jobs ford thought they had good jobs lots of   hundreds and hundreds  thousands of companies have left  thousands millions of jobs and hillary clinton is weak and she is ineffective and there is no way you can allow four more years of this stuff to go on theres just no way in my opinion  but lets say  and by the way your steel mills in ohio where china is dumping steel to put you guys out of business  theyre dumping  you know that whos in steel over here am i right theyre dumping steel to put the steelworkers out of business and hillary said the miners  any miners in here miners i love the miners oh west virginia was good to me ill tell you and ohio was good to me a lot of miners in ohio miner but hillary clinton said were going to put the miners and the mines out of business now she said that before probably an environmental group or something but then she tried to back up but they remembered she said it and she got clobbered in west virginia smart people she got clobbered in west virginia so were going to have clean coal and were going to have steel and were going to make our products again  and were going to have the people in columbus and all of ohio and all of michigan and all of these other states  you know i did great in michigan i did great in ohio too unfortunately i didnt have a long time to campaign if i would have spent two more days here i would have won ohio too because i won practically everything else we got almost  million votes think of that more than anybody in the history of republican primaries that includes some great people like ronald reagan dwight d eisenhower who won the second world war right he did win the second world war got elected because he won the second world war i got more votes than him thats good right and remember this i had  people i wasnt running against two people i had  people hillary clinton i got a similar number to hillary clinton and she had bernie and she had a hard time putting bernie away and bernie  poor bernie he looked so upset you know what he made a mistake he shouldnt have made a deal sometimes  he lost he lost first of all it was rigged and im afraid the election is going to be rigged i have to be honest because i think my side was rigged  if i didnt win by massive landslides  i mean think of what we won in new york and indiana california  percent thats with other people in the race but think of it i hear more and more that the election on november   can you believe were almost there this started on june  of last year and i said wow lets go do it takes guts to do this believe me and everybody said  no it takes guts i could be having a very nice life right now i dont have to be with you people ranting and raving could have a very nice life but it takes guts and everybody said this is the greatest field i remember charles krauthammer saying this is the greatest field ever assembled in the history of republican politics or something to that effect this is before i got in and i said to my wife you know its a great field charles krauthammer and others are saying this is the greatest field ever assembled its also the largest field ever assembled so i have the greatest largest field ever assembled and then one day i just i had it i watched the iran deal this horrible deal be done where we give back  billion and theyre making nuclear weapons and weve made a power out of iran they were struggling for their life and weve made a power out of iran in fact they were in serious trouble when they were all marching in the streets it was over and obama came to their rescue if you remember that first term that was a bad day that was going to be over for them and we came to their rescue now weve made them into a power ok a big power but i saw the iran deal and i saw the stupidity on trade where companies are leaving  one of them was carrier left indiana  people fired moving to indiana theyre going to make their plant theyre going to build it theyre going to take their air conditioners make them sell them right back into indiana and other places no tax no nothing with me theyre going to be taxed  percent and you know what theyre never going to move theyre never moving folks theyre never moving did you ever see  because i love this stuff you know people say not a politician remember when they said a certain person well he got clobbered raised tremendous amounts of money and everybody thought hed do really well but they say  but he hasnt been an active politician for eight years ive never been a politician and weve won in a landslide so  but i dont get credit for that they dont give me credit what are you going to do i was joking  i was joking because some people thought i was a little bit too tough  and i have been  certain people that i ran against in the republican primaries have never come back and they probably wont and thats ok i do better when they dont come back i do better if i have them as my opponent as opposed to my ally no no but we have a few you know their names we have a few they havent come back they havent come back ill tell you i was honored at the convention for two reasons number one i had  million people watching hillary had what  million people this final speech so we had more people watching the press built up that convention like it was the greatest democrat convention  i actually thought  i liked the republican convention i would rather watch  i would rather watch ivanka trump than any of their celebrities i can tell you i would rather watch don and eric and tiffany and melania did a great job i would rather watch them than any of their celebrities you know they all said well donald trump had his kids  isnt that nice if you have kids that are capable enough to go up and do it you know why people havent had their kids go up because their kids cant do it and i can understand that thats a hard thing to do my kids went up they were brave they were strong tiffany we pushed her out on the stage go she never did it before tiffany said this is really scary and we just said just go do it and she did beautifully she never spoke to anybody  its true the biggest group shes ever spoken to is like  people in a class where she was a very good student i have to say but they did a great job but i actually liked the republican national convention better  ill tell you what we had a much better looking stage number one which is important we won for stage  but we got a very unfair press when bernie sanders had his people leaving the room nobody covered that if i would have had people leave the room it would have been a national scandal when a certain man got up  and i knew his speech i said look let him speak what difference does it make and  he says  a certain man got up and he spoke and everybody in the room booed the hell out of him in fact i saved his life when i walked back into the room but everybody in the room  and his numbers went down like from  to  something thats called unity folks thats unity thats a good thing not a bad thing that is unity and  but the problem we have  the biggest problem we have i think is the press the new york times is totally dishonest totally dishonest the washington post gotten a little bit better lately i took away their press credentials i should do it with the times but  the problem is you get more publicity from doing  just let them rot but the new york times is really really dishonest and its failing i dont think theyll be in business more than two or three years look at their numbers theyre failing but they do a number thats unbelievable every story is bad  in fact sometimes ill say oh great this was so good im going to have a great story tomorrow in the new york times you know theyll call always turned out to be a disaster they  its so dishonest and yet hillary hillary crooked hillary they write beautifully about right washington post similar it was really bad now its gotten a little bit better i must tell you washington post got a little bit better cnn is so dishonest clinton news network so dishonest unbelievable do you know what they call it it may be the clinton news network but nobody wants to watch hillary all day long its trump all day all the time thats what it is but its so much inaccurate information and by the way i think their ratings are going to go down really sharply now theyve been asking me to go on for months i wont do their shows and the reason i wont is because its so dishonest that until they straighten up im not doing their shows and when people finally realize that im not doing their shows they stop watching thats what happens and i must say i dont say this for a reason and theyre tough theyre very tough on me but fox has at least been fair theyve been fair fox has been fair so at some point at some point were just gonna keep barreling through people asked me to run people asked me to run at wheel donald trump  letters and everything you know we have  million people between twitter and  can you believe it  you know i have a lot of people they say dont use twitter anymore i say why i get  million people between that and facebook and instagram im a very modern person in a way right you know who says dont use twitter your enemies why wouldnt i use it why wouldnt i  if i have all these millions of people and its a great way to get a message out so when they write falsely or say something totally false on the today show or good morning america ive put out a tweet and youll see all over television  we have breaking news and i may be tweeting from bed ok its true its instantaneous if i put out a beautiful long perfectly scripted press release like i did yesterday nobody puts it out if i put out a character tweet they go crazy we have breaking news they break into every story so you got to use it  well heres a story i love ohio ive been here i work here i dont know if you know  i worked in cincinnati for a period of time i had great success it was one of my first jobs i did it with my father it was called swifton village and we bought something that was a disaster it was empty it had  units it was a total disaster and we bought it from hud and turned it around i was here i did a great job it gave me great confidence because its good to head  with a good job and then we sold it at a tremendous profit and we went on to the next and i loved cincinnati and interestingly after i sold it the job went very bad the job went very bad i mean  my timing was very good i listened to people but i really listened to myself and the timing was beautiful we had it for a number of years but we sold it and the day i sold it to the day we closed contract was bought by a reit one of the early reits it lost a lot of its occupants thats how the timing was it was perfect timing i just think of cincinnati the queen city i love cincinnati i love kentucky i go to kentucky for fun i wont tell you what  can you imagine that story if they find out about that but i love kentucky and kentucky likes me boy did i do well in kentucky kentucky we love kentucky and were gonna take care of the miners in kentucky believe me were going to take care of the miners in kentucky but i had a great time in cincinnati and i had a great time in ohio the people of ohio are special people and theyre smart people and they know what is happening to them they know great things are gonna happen we are gonna turn this state into a manufacturing behemoth were gonna bring your jobs back were gonna bring your companies back were gonna bring companies that left are gonna come back because it will no longer be economic for them to continue where they are were gonna bring companies back were gonna bring companies back you know i tell this one story youve heard about with carrier in indiana which i won in a landslide that was supposed to be the firewall remember that indiana will be his firewall they said new york weve expect him to win pennsylvania we expect him to win won maryland rhode island delaware  we won them all we expect him but indiana is going to be the firewall right and then bobby knight called and bobby knight  how about bobby knight we love bobby knight right winner hes a winner bobby knight and he came out   games three national championships last undefeated college team won the olympics won the pan am games other than that eh hes a good coach right we love bobby knight and what a job and what a tough cookie and he said to me i hope youre gonna run for president this is before i knew him he called me you should run for president youll be great i said bobby i havent decided this was before june th a few months i havent decided he said just run and then when i ran i called him and he said ive been waiting for you to call and we went to indiana and it was incredible but the thing that happened that ive been talking about for a year and it happened to be in indiana was when carrier air conditioner fired  people right they fired  people like dogs like dogs they fired them its on tape had i not seen it on tape on television it wouldnt have had the impact that it had these are people who had worked there some of them for more than  years and they would follow me around all over indiana and id have the people from carrier so let me just tell you if i were negotiating and lets say i heard they were gonna close and if i said folks want to meet with you wheres your president they send their president along said let me tell you youre leaving  great people now if you want to stay within the united states thats a different deal the states will compete against themselves right but you want to move to mexico you want to build a plant i wish you luck but if you do that youre going to pay this  percent tax heres whats gonna happen folks folks heres whats gonna happen so simple theyre not gonna leave theyre not gonna leave because it doesnt work economically for them to leave so now theyre not gonna leave and if they do leave thats ok too because were gonna make a fortune ok were gonna make a fortune  now ive been watching this country for seven or eight or nine years even before obama working on plans to stop people and companies from leaving the united states ive seen lowinterest loans ive seen zerointerest loans  ive seen it all ive seen it all ive seen every plan you can imagine ive seen where they give them money they do everything a lot of these companies dont need money they just want to make more but you know what my plan which is so simple  we dont need anything nice and simple and when i say that to the company  if youre running a company you in the blue and youre running a company and i say to you if you leave ohio i wish you a lot of luck enjoy the warm climate in mexico but if you leave ohio youre not going to make your product and sell it back into ohio where you have all these unemployed people whats going to happen is youre going to have a tax to pay to get the product back in now when you hear that youre not going to be very fast to leave youre not going to actually leave ok almost  percent youre not going to leave its just not going to work because the economics dont work anymore now when my friend talks about its the eighth wonder of the world mexico  i think thats great i respect mexico i love the mexican people i have thousands of mexican people that have worked for me over the years thousands and thousands theyre great but their leaders are too smart for our leaders ok and theyre stripping our country and theyre stripping ohio so hillary clinton doesnt talk this way hillary gets up and she reads her teleprompter we are going to build new roads we are going to build new schools we are going to build  we are going to build and just like the two gentlemen that came up here youll be let down  percent but me this is my thing ive been talking about this for years you know somebody said its amazing trumps been talking about this for  years it used to be japan remember when i talked about japan now its china but its still japan japan made a fortune devaluing their currency china makes a fortune with currency manipulation its cheating its cheating and when i sit down and say listen youve got to stop this youre killing us youve got  billion trade deficits for us you got to stop it  we have rebuilt china and when i tell them this and when i say listen you got to do it you got to do it  see we have all the power but nobody knows it like when we catch them cheating ten percent tax right across the board every good coming in from china right now heres whats going to happen  number one theyre going to stop cheating and if they dont we collect ten percent we make a fortune but theyre going to stop cheating theres nobody that tells them this when they come over president obama they put a tent on the white house lawn right and they give them a steak dinner like youve never seen before although i would have a ballroom i offered to build a ballroom you know  they turned it down i was going to put up  million to build a ballroom at the white house because having a tent is not that good its not even that safe a canvas tent and they never even got back to me thats the way it is if i were president somebody offered that id say give me the top five american architects in the untied states get them over here all of you come up with a ballroom that holds  people  people and theyll come up and one of them will be beautiful and well build it ill take the guys money believe me i promise somebody wants to build a ballroom at the white house they turned me down no interest no interest because thats the way the country is so im only saying to the people of ohio to the people of columbus i want to tell you were going to turn this country around and were going to make it so strong and so great and were going to run it smart were not going to run it stupid like it is youre not going to have  when i look at your numbers when my statistician writes all this stuff out its just one bad number after another its a terrible  i mean honestly its a terrible thing look columbus columbus ohio has lost one in three manufacturing jobs since bill clinton signed nafta right columbus has lost one in four manufacturing jobs since bill clinton signed an agreement to put china into the world trade organization hillary rammed through the job killing trade deal with south korea  thats been a killer the deal with south korea has been a killer i buy thousands of television sets thousands and thousands  nobody makes television sets remember we used to have sylvania for those of us that are old enough we had general electric we had all these companies  weve got nobody we dont make television sets we dont make a lot soon we wont make anything and you can only have so many nursing homes in a factory a lot of factories were taken they were made into nursing homes i think thats great but you can only have so many of them we need jobs look at this i mean abandon  diplomatic personnel  so many different things supports i told you this  supports at  percent increase it was sort of amazing because the press is always saying well youre wrong and you exaggerated that number no matter  if you said two and two are four they will get these super liberal groups to say well hes not really right its not really four you know when i read off the crime statistics about the police that are being shot like in dallas and other places and i read about it and i said we had a  percent increase in police shootings and they said well yes but that was only for this year but if you go over  years or  years or if you go over  years a little bit less  look folks the country is a mess were going to make it strong again were going to make it safe again youre going to be so proud of it and youre going to be proud of your president but more importantly youre going to be proud of your country so why dont we take a few questions and when were finished with the questions lets go back to work and those of you that dont have work hang in there jobs will be back sooner than you think ok believe me yes go ahead   right   ok there cant be a better question other than on defense because were going to build up our depleted military most importantly  defense is always number one dont you think but were going to build our depleted  were going to take care of our vets ok obamacare number one were going to repeal it and replace it  percent it is a total disaster you saw whats happening in texas blue cross blue shield working through obamacare  percent increase heres the thing  nobody knows this the numbers are so bad on obamacare so bad that on november  theyre going to be announced those numbers are presidential election changing numbers those numbers are going to be so high beyond anything weve had and president obama is trying to change the date to december  because when people see whats going to happen to obamacare and to your health care numbers theyre so astronomical that people will never vote for crooked hillary clinton theyre never going to vote for her  so  and you asked a very interesting question the way you phrased it was very interesting because you have a lot of part time workers now that never had a parttime job in their life you have people in this room  dont raise your hands but you have people in this room that are making less money now than they made  years ago in real wages less money and in some cases theyre making less money and working two jobs and thats largely because of obamacare because companies save money by breaking it up so theyll take fulltime beautiful employees that have worked for companies for years and theyll say im sorry youre going to be a parttime employee from now on obamacare has been a disaster obamacare is so unfair and you know you had a lot of people that had good plans we have to take care of people that cant that dont have the money to take care of themselves you look like a rich guy ok at least modestly rich i think could be very rich but we have to take care of people that cant afford it and im all for that and we have something coming i think thats going to be great and a lot of republicans would say thats not republican let me tell you it is republican folks you know every time ive ever said it ive never had anybody other than the eggheads you know the people that said trump is never going to run and if he runs i dont think hell do very well we got a six we got a  we got  i mean forget it but you know what other than these so called eggheads we never  and i mean this we never had anybody in an audience when i said were going to have a great plan were getting rid of the boundaries were going to have great private competition and youre going to have plans now that we cant even talk about because these companies will come up with plans and its going to be so much less expensive and so much better and for the people that cant afford that were going to take care of them and i tell you what ive never had one person  and i have the biggest crowds of anybody ive never had one person stand up and say thats not republican except for the eggheads they say you cant do that we got to take care of people we cant have people dying in the streets we cant have our vets as an example dying waiting in line because they cant get to see a doctor  and without vets interestingly but without vets when you have these massive waits were going to have our vets go to the local doctors or the local hospital private or public take care of themselves theyre not going to be committing suicide many are committing suicide because of the waits they cant stand it they cant stand the pain simple procedures can save their lives simple procedures a little incision a small operation a pill a pill can save their lives and theyre dying waiting for a doctor and were going to  and my plan is filed policy were going to have people they cant get in theyre going to go theyre going to see a local doctor theyre going to see a local hospital public or private were going to pay for the bill and by the way thats number one from the humanitarian standpoint thats great and even less importantly because ultimately we got to save people its going to be less expensive and were not going to have the problems that we have where people are committing suicide so many people every day vets are committing suicide because they cant even get to see the doctor to help them one of the big reasons of vet suicide so we got to take care of that and were going to take care of the obama  were going to repeal replace were going to take care of everybody ok thank you good question  ok yes go ahead   well its really a great question ryan because the thing that maybe surprised me the most is  to me taxes are very important its all taxes its such a big cost or can be a big cost now we have a tax bill or we have a tax law thats very complicated but its a big cost if you would have told me going around  and ive met so many small business owners and so many large business owners that if they had their choice between bringing our taxes down now i have the largest tax decrease  of anybody thats run for office larry kudlow loves it a lot of people love it but its the largest tax decrease of any person running for office from the beginning republican or democrat ok hillary is going to have to double taxes is going to have to double your taxes hillary clinton will double your taxes were bringing it down to  percent were simplifying the system people that are making very little are going to pay nothing until they can break into the system and youll save a lot of money bureaucratically that way but people that are making very little are going to pay nothing instead of sending in complicated returns and paying nothing but we have a very beautiful plan very simple very simple and very important but if you would have told me after speaking with thousands of people that regulations if they had their choice you can have either reduced regulation  because people cant open businesses they cant run their businesses you can either have lower taxes or reduced regulation people would take the regulation that surprised me thats how bad regulations are youre looking at the energy business the energy businesses is being put out of business its being put out of business many small business owners have come up to me saying mr trump im going to lose my business because the regulations so were going to take care were going to cut down the regulations i would be between  and  percent ok now some are necessary i know for safety but some are necessary but ill bet we can cut every year every year it must be a cottage industry they have people that just write regulations all day long were going to cut down regulations between  and  percent were going to take care of the environment were going to take care of safety but were going to let it be that were going to be a growing growing when you look at  percent that set a record that means were drowning that means were going in the opposite direction so were going to take care of regulations were going to have very very big cuts in regulations ok another question whos got the mike go ahead yes   hi   good good place   heroin   yeah i will cut off the source  build the wall i will cut off the source  good question very well asked thank you very much heroin so my first victory as a candidate number one was new hampshire which is a beautiful beautiful place beautiful trees beautiful meadows beautiful little roads and i got to know the people of new hampshire very well and i did unbelievable we won in a landslide in new hampshire that was at the beginning when we had all these people competing its a great state and they have unbelievable people and i got to know the people and id go into meetings and id say so whats your biggest problem and they would always say heroin heroin i said what do you mean heroin  theyd say heroin id say this doesnt look like its a heroin like problem type place they say mr trump it is flowing across our southern border its cheaper than candy our kids are being poisoned theyre being addicted not only kids but kids theyre being addicted theyre dying and for some reason new hampshire more than any other place talks about it  thats why im so glad you asked that question but  heroin so i said so where do you think it comes  whats the source its the southern border it comes through the southern border i said let me tell you if i win im going to stop it im gonna stop it now we had   border patrol agents who are unbelievable people who if they didnt endorse me would have a much easier job because all they have to do is stand there and people walk right through them right with me theyre gonna stop people from coming into our country ok theyre gonna stop them and theyre not gonna have to work that hard because of the wall i asked them how important is the wall they said very important very important new hampshire told me about heroin and i said wow and i said if i win im gonna stop heroin from coming into this country and there are going to be big repercussions and im gonna get the government of mexico and other governments to stop it or theyve got problems with all the money we give them theyd better take better care theyre not taking care of us theyre not taking care of us you know ive talked about trade deficits we have a massive trade deficit with mexico that doesnt include the drugs that are coming across we get the drugs they get the money like this big vans coming across drugs coming in money going out those days are over folks those days are over  so i won new hampshire i then went down to all different places we did great in massachusetts home of tom brady we love tom brady but we did great in massachusetts we did great  sort of everywhere but i see what a huge problem  its not just in new hampshire its all over the place heroin is all over the place mothers and fathers are losing their children and heroin is a very addictive thing its very hard to get out of that addiction of heroin its very very hard and thats the other thing were gonna do were gonna take all of these kids and people not just kids that are totally addicted and they cant break it were gonna work with them were gonna spend the money were gonna get that habit broken but were not gonna let this crap come into our country and poison our youth and poison our people and it comes in mostly from the southern border and hillary clinton isnt gonna do that number one shes not strong enough to do it she wouldnt have a clue so ladies and gentlemen thank you very much november th youve got to go and vote ill be back ill be back so much youll be sick of me but november th you have to go and vote weve got to win this election this is a big one ohio is a very important state we have to go we have to win this election i love you all thank you thank you very much thank you"
42,"Trump","thank you so we have tremendous crowds of people outside  would anybody like to give up your seat  d  so i think what were going to have to do is a little different you know we have been so crowded theres something going on big even bigger than before because every place we go we have these massive crowds yesterday we were in ohio we were in pennsylvania and harrisburg and we had crowds that were so enormous so much bigger than the venue so were gonna have to start using the basketball arenas dont you agree  you know we have  outside we have like thousands of people theyre going crazy because they cant get in so bear with us but i did get to wave to them ok so it was good but these are great people you know something very nice just happened to me a man came up to me and he handed me his purple heart  now i said to him now is that like the real one or is that a copy  and he said thats my real purple heart i have such confidence in you and i said man thats like  thats like big stuff i always wanted to get the purple heart this was much easier but i tell you it was such an honor and maybe i can bring him up on the stage lieutenant colonel louis dorfman i just have to    so i said lieutenant colonel would you like to say something he goes no sir id like you to just keep saying what youve been saying its amazing  what an honor what an honor that was great so thank you all for being here were gonna have a little fun this morning and were going to be back in virginia a lot we have to win virginia  you know i have a club in virginia do you all know my club trump national  and if we could do to the united states what i did to that boy would we have a country thered be nothing like it anywhere ever in history but you know i took over a club what  years ago and it was on the potomac river and its right next door and in fact i wish we did this out at the golf club to be honest with you right on the potomac maybe well do that the next one lets do it on the potomac i dont know do it right right  well do it outside on the potomac by the american flag you know i have tremendous acreage there we have like almost  acres and its got two clubs two courses we have the pga coming next year for a big big big tournament and its the best there is in the tristate its one of the best golf courses in the country and its been a tremendous successd  well i took it over it was great acreage but it was not so great right and we blew it up and built new and it was  its been a fantastic success and its in loudon county and therefore i cant imagine that the people of loudon are going to be voting for crooked hillary clinton she doesnt do anything because  ive   d  yeah   d  so did you see over the weekend fox chris wallace where she lied where she said the fbi director said like everything was just perfect it wasnt exactly  i mean she lied she pure and simple  she only knows to lie she really does only knows to lie but she lied and its a big story its become a big story and thats amazing its amazing that they covered because the press is so totally dishonest ok so totally dishonest and there is nothing like it ive never seen dishonesty like that and theyre pushing her like crazy because its establishment stuff and we have to make change you know shes now calling herself an agent of change shes been doing this for  years you know numbers just came out for her where she raised like  or  million and  people gave it i think it was  lets see  people gave her  million in her fund  million from  people i want to get a list of those  people oh those  people i want to find out who they are i want to find out how many i know i want to find out  i want to find out how many i know but ill tell you what  people gave her  million and thats what ive been saying folks look i know the game better than anybody and the game is played that way they own her they own her they will do whatevers good for them if they have a company that wants to move plants into mexico shes going to say  first shell say thats no good and then shell say oh i see they helped me i have to let them do it because her handlers  thats what they are is handlers  they write her speeches they write everything she doesnt give a talk like this with no teleprompters she gets up and she has teleprompters she gets on the stage for  minutes she reads something and she leaves she goes back home and goes to sleep thats what she does she reads it she goes home she goes to sleep and thats ok im not knocking it but the  people think of it so you have  people giving  million it just got announced or its being announced today but were announcing something even more special were announcing that were going to have more than  million from a group of people like almost  people averaging   this doesnt happen to republicans you know most republicans i mean i think all if they ever did that theyd have like three people giving  and theyll say thats about as good as were going to do were going to have close to  people and its going to be think of it it averages  approximately i guess its going to be filed later or tomorrow or something but it averages  each and well have  million but i think its going to even be higher than that because its not totally tabulated but its going to be higher than that and that doesnt include other money that were getting from the rnc and the republican party and it doesnt include the money that i put up because i put up a lot of money to fund my own campaign and  d   a lot i think im into this for over  million  over    million if you dont vote for me look at the money  ill probably be in for  by the time i finish think of it  million cash    ok good thank you ill be in for over  and think of it no tax deduction see everything i do i think tax after tax before tax but no deductions but ill be in for over  million when its all finished or thereabouts and its a lot of money thats a lot of money and nobody else does that other rich people dont do that either not that many rich people run because theyre told if youre rich and if youre successful you cant run for political office because theyll kill you and i said i agree i do agree i think im a testament to either never do it or do it i will say this  i will say this its been unbelievable its been  the journey from june  coming down on the escalators its been an unbelievable event i came down with melania on that escalator and i want to tell you  everybody loves melania  they love melania shes a good person ill tell you that shes smart and i thought she gave an unbelievable speech unbelievable presentation unbelievable  and ivanka did the introduction unbelievable job  and tiffany and don and who do we have here today we have eric  eric wheres eric eric come here  eric trump everybody  e  wow this is a great crowd wow well listen we are and i say this all the time but were so proud of my father its an honor to be in loudoun in fact him and i when i came out of college the first job we worked on together was the great golf course that we have here and the two of sat there and we put a tremendous amount of time and effort into rebuilding it and we had a great time and it was kind of the perfect  perfect first opportunity for a son to work with a father and ive learned so much from this man hes been such an incredible father and mentor and boss and friend and every other word that you could put on it hes just the best and he will do a great job for this nation he will do such a great job for all of you and we are so so so immensely proud of him so with that i give you back to the big guy thank you so much loudoun county  d  hes a good guy hes done a good job  hes in there pitching  and i thought the republican national convention was better than the other one ok  i think my kids were great i thought everybody did great i actually thought it was better and we had more people watching the final night because that was the speech that means a lot by millions but i will tell you i will tell you yes friend or foe probably friend thank you all right your  seconds of fame well now that bernies out we dont have the  doesnt happen anymore its like amazing its  you know the safest place to be anywhere is at a trump rally thats true  safest place to be i mean ill just tell you something you dont even know youre doing it but here we are we have chairs right everybodys standing d  everybodys standing because we have  its excitement theres like an excitement in the air you have seats and everybody stands if you want you can sit down but everybody said   they dont want to sit down  but we have such fun considering we have a very bad subject you know the country is in trouble but were going to make it good you know a lot of people thought my speech was dark the  the haters  no only the haters we got great marks  but the haters said well he did a good job his delivery everything was good but it was dark and i said it wasnt dark i talk about radical islamic terrorism  i talk about  i talk about drugs pouring across the border i talk people coming in that arent supposed to be here i talk about crime i talk about our police being shot we love our police and we have to protect our police  i talk about our veterans because our veterans are being treated horribly  when you hear twentytwo suicides a day thats inconceivable twentytwo suicides a day our veterans are being treated horribly were going to turn that around so fast your head is going to spin  people  people waiting in line for    days the veterans our great people and thats why maybe the lieutenant colonel did that i mean its such an amazing thing i  he showed it me and i said here thank you very much heres a  no mr trump i want you to keep it i said keep it i mean these are incredible things that happen these are incredible people that i meet and thinking about lieutenant colonel thinking about our military  our military is totally depleted totally depleted our military is not being funded properly we dont have enough money going in we need a strong military we need a powerful strong military  when you look at whats happening  when you look at whats happening around the world and when you look at the hatred think of it we are like the whipping post for many many countries on trade they kill us on trade but in every way they dont respect us china is building this massive massive military complex in the south china sea they didnt get environmental impact statements by the way they just  they said on monday morning were going to start building and on monday afternoon they started you knows thats the way it works right we would  we could never do that because we would have to environmental impact statements  would  years then they would reject it  we dont do things like that and you know thats fine theyre not supposed it do it  theyre not supposed to do it they dont respect us now very simply we have tremendous power with china some of the top people in the world representing china have called me and one of them in particular said you know mrtrump i thought you were so wrong a year ago i heard your very strong rhetoric on trade with china and everything with china and you have to understand china is great as far as im concerned i want to get along with china  by the way wouldnt it be great if we got along with russia wouldnt that be great  if we actually had a relationship with russia instead of all the fighting and money and the problems and if we could get russia and others to partner up and go and knock the hell out of isis wouldnt that be a good thing wouldnt that be a good thing  these people  these people are so obsolete you know these people you know sometimes theyll say oh could i have a list of your  the people that youre consulting with i said well youre not going to like it because these are people that arent involved currentlyd  well why arent they involved currently they said because look at the world its a mess i dont wanna use the people that are involved currently look at the world its a mess look at what happened in the middle east look at whats going on with north korea and look at whats going on with  we have a mess out there we have a total mess because ill give names that are better and theyll say but these people havent been involved and i said who wants the people that are currently involved nothings working out nothings working out look at libya look at syria look at the migration look at iraq what a mess look at  look at afghanistan what a mess look at everything if we didnt do anything with iraq if we never went there if our presidents went to the beach wed be much better off if they just went every single day to the beach and took it easy let obama go to the golf course but  but you know what wed be better off and then the way obama got us out of the war was a disaster were going to get out on a certain date the enemies sat back and they said nobody could say that nobody actually they thought it was a form of camouflage actually they didnt believe it until it happened he actually said when theyre getting out but they laid back and then after we left you  you see whats happening so look we have people that dont know what theyre doing hillary clinton will be worse shell be worse ok hillary clinton will be worse she has bad relationships with people like putin ill give you an example she has terrible relationships with putin this is a nuclear country were talking about russia strong nuclear country and so are we but their stuff is newer their stuff is newer so shes looking at  they have more  i dont even want to say it  they have a lot more ok so you know she wants to play the tough one shes not tough shes not tough i know tough people shes not tough i mean shes  shes just  shes doing the handlers they push her from place to place thats all it is you saw her speech the other night i mean they talk about presidential do you think she looks presidential i dont think so   i dont think so so  so you know she wants to play the role of the tough guy against putin and russia and she wants to play not tough not tough she should be tough on trade ok because right now we are being ripped off on trade like nobody has ever ripped us off in history you look at our trade deficits with china hundreds i mean just take a look  the numbers five  think of this five hundred and five billion dollars look at our trade deficits total more than  billion trade deficits coming out of this area by the way coming out of the state of va and every place else i mean ive gone through  i won so many states and we won in landslides or i wouldnt be here look if i didnt win this system was not set up for somebody like me to come in and exert brains and common sense ok it wasnt set up for that its set up for politicians  and if i didnt win in massive landslides i mean i won by a landslide got  million almost  million votes thats more than anybody has ever gotten in the history of the republican party and remember  and thats with  people people keep forgetting thats with  people and yet we had  you know when ronald reagan who we loved but when other people ran theyd run against one or two people or three peopled  and its a lot different seventeen people we broke the alltime record i think were gonna do so great and i see some great polls i see one from  from the los angeles times just came out where were ahead by four or five points i see one from cnn where were down i think these polls i dont know theres something about these polls theres something phony you know i watch cnn they are so negative all day long its all trump all day long and you know what their ratings are going down and their ratings are going to start to go down big because i dont do interviews for them theyre doing a big documentary on me now they have one problem they need an interview from me so let them do it without me who cares but theyre very unfair all day long its negative in fact i have some great things that have happened right and theyll cover it in a negative manner so it sounds negative great stuff great stuff even when i was winning  i was winning by tremendous numbers we had numerous people left and id get like  percent of the vote with many people getting  percent is impossible i get  percent they say why hasnt he hit  i said well theyre  people how do you get  you understand right no but cnn treats me so badly its unbelievable and you know what i dont watch it anymore i dont watch you know you learn to live good you learn to stay healthy you learn to have a good common smart mind by turning off the negative does that make sense turn it off dont fight it turn it off just turn it off but cnn treats me so badly i mean the new york times which i call the failing new york times because its failing its losing a fortune and it will be  i think its out of business in three years maybe somebodys going to buy it for a little while until they lose all that money but theyll buy it for a little while and theyll keep it as  you know some rich guys going to buy it but the new york times which is  it could do worse i mean frankly that wouldnt be bad if somebody bought it  but the new york times is failing badly they write stories that are so bad about me and you know all my life ive probably been on the cover of the times a few times right now if i have two stories or three stories a day on the cover  today i have two stories both ridiculous stories  but today i have two stories  for  the front page i mean i guess they use me to sell newspapers but they are so dishonest the reporting is so dishonest i wont get into individual reporters names because id like to  i could tell you the good ones and the bad ones and they have a couple of good ones over there but they are such a dishonest newspaper they want hillary clinton to win so badly they cry they beg they beg the editorials are unbelievable i mean heres a woman who is a total thief i mean shes a crook shes a crook and she lies more than any human being ive ever seen and shes got no gravitas and by the way shes got a bad temperament shes got a temperament of a loser i mean im going to get the barack obama clips when he beat her eight years ago barack obama said things about her that were so bad and today i just said do me a favor look them up because i remember how bad now all of a sudden hes supporting her and you know look its a hope because shes going to keep obamacare shes going to let people continue to pour into our country and we have no idea who the hell they are shes going to let the syrian refugees come in and we dont know if theyre isis we have no idea its going to be the all time great trojan horse  they come in by the thousands and she wants  hard to believe actually it was funny  i actually said it was  percent and the press said i was wrong they said it was  you believe that they actually even corrected me on that d  but  percent more coming into the country that are coming in right now think of it so someday it always happens look at france look at germany look at whats going on with people blowing themselves up in a bar with people shooting look at paris look what happened in paris  dead many many people still in the hospital theyll never be  theyll never be recovered  never be recovered but you just take a look at whats happened and you tell me that we have to be weak weak and ineffective and that we have to allow tens of thousands of people to pour into our country she wants  percent more people think of it  percent more people coming in from that region that are coming in under barack obama and you know theyre put all over the country you dont even know where the hell they are so were going to have problems like you have never seen mark my words ive been a very good prognosticator ive called a lot of good things and bad things but ive called them but mark my words youre going to see some bad stuff we need strong borders we need strong borders  we cant have people coming in from syria that have bad intentions and we dont know who they are and if we do we are really a very foolish nation look at whats happening with germany the crime wave over there  merkels not going to be elected you know brexit i predicted brexit remember i was the only one so they were given a  percent chance in las vegas and the bookies over there they were saying  percent chance i said i think its going to win i took such heat remember i took such heat i won and they gave me  even though i won they all said bad things oh they said i was grandstanding because i won i just  they said whos going to win i said i think theyre going to pull out theyre going to pull out of the union the uk is going to pull out of the union so i said the european union so i said thats going to happen and the reason is im there i have a lot of property in the uk great property fantastic property  turnberry  i have so many great properties but you know what i felt just  i had a feel and im not there much i may never it again if i win i may never see my property  i may never see these places  again but boy is eric and the kids going to have a good time right theyre going to have a good time  but because im going to be working for you im not going to have time to go play golf and  believe me folks  but i had a feeling i said i think uks going for independence because they dont want to have people pouring into their country that they dont know where they are who they are they have enough they have enough and theyve had enough and they voted and it was a shock and you know what theyre better off and you watch other countries in the european union are going to follow because they were forced to take people and now its getting to be catastrophic proportions and you watch what happens to angela merkel who i always thought of as a very good leader until she did this i dont know what went wrong with her i dont know what went wrong angela what happened what happened angela  and you take a look at whats going on in germany the real facts ok i have friends that live in germany for years they were so proud they were saying this is the country donald this is so great this is the  people now tell me theyre going to leave germany leave i said what are you talking about were going to leave they take in millions of people and they dont know anything about and whats going on you know the terms of whats going on the women have heard all about whats going on ok let me tell you folks we are allowing thousands and thousands of people into our country ive spoken to the best law enforcement people that we have who are great people and they said theres no way to properly vet these people theres no wayd  because we dont know where they really come from they have no paperwork so what they do is they make up paperwork everybody makes up paperwork remember when they stole our passport machine remember they have a passport machine thats better than the stuff we have ok these are smart people by the way this is not  these are smart people these are very smart people and i have a bigger heart than anybody in this room or as big we wanna do safe zones in syria i will get the gulf states who are not doing much believe me the gulf states have nothing but money im gonna get them to pay we are  trillion were not paying for it were not pay  theyre gonna pay they are gonna pay we are gonna get the gulf states to pay for it theyre gonna pay dont forget without us the gulf states wont exist they wont exist so were gonna get the gulf states to pay   and were gonna be the smart country again but were not gonna let this happen where all of a sudden our cafes start blowing up our movie theaters start blowing up full of people and all of the other things that youve been seeing all over the world i mean all over the world who wouldve believed that horrible scene in nice who wouldve believed a think like thats even possible just driving a truck down killing everybody running all over everybody you know what they were screaming they were screaming something that they always seem to scream ok and ill tell you what its not going to happen here were going to be very very tough and very very smart  and we can be folks  we can be the stupid people and we can be the politically correct people and guess what were not gonna have much of a country left believe me ok  so that we have to have it so look stop  with  it  you know a lot of bad numbers right a lot of bad numbers hillary said she wants to keep it the same but shes gonna change you noticed shes saying i wanna keep it the same but we gotta change first of all she cant change shes  shes been doing it for  years you know ii say if she wants to change why didnt she change shes been doing this a long time her husband signed the worst trade deal in the history of the world probably and i really mean that im not exaggerating nafta the worst  now they wanna do tpp transpacific partnership its going to be as bad as nafta if not worse numerous countries documents that are  pages long our people havent even read the documents ok i wanna do individual country i like trade individual countries boom boom boom if they do a bad job with us  you have to see what this tpp looks like with the lines line line lines all over the place looks like a jigsaw puzzle simple simple deals are tough enough complicated enough simple boom individual countries were rewarding people that have treated us badly and theyre going in with people that have treated us well  meaning countries i want individual countries and if they do something bad or they devalue their currency so that our companies can compete because youre losing all your jobs i mean i just left pennsylvania i just left ohio i just  im going to be very soon in michigan upstate new york is a disaster area i mean you look at these  you look at these big beautiful plants that are just rotting theyre just rotting i flew into harrisburg pennsylvania yesterday and i looked down and i looked at  it look like a war zone where you have these massive plants and you could see  years ago vibrance   families being taken care of work education healthcare people working its all in mexico now the businesses have moved to mexico and other places but between china mexico others theyve taken our businesses vietnam very big right now really taking over i mean theyre doing a great job for them not for us vietnams a hot one right now take a look d  but were not gonna let that happen were not gonna let it happen were gonna be smart when a company moves and wants to move as an example to mexico were gonna wish them luck but when they wanna sell their product back into this country were gonna say sorry but you have a  percent tax to pay to get your product back in and when we do that theyre not gonna move theyre not moving theyre not going to move  because we will have taken the economics of moving away from this country and ive watched for years ive watched for years more that just obama ive watched for a long period of time presidents saying and politicians saying how do we keep our companies because theyre moving theyre just leaving remember they did the low interest loans they dont need money they did all sorts of tax abatements  they dont want tax abatements  im doing the ultimate im saying you make a product outside of the country and when you leave and when you fire all of our people and youre going to now make that product in  as an example mex  no there are other places  but when that product comes across the border youre going to pay a  percent tax and heres whats going to happen for the most part theyre not going to move ok i think very few are going to move because youve taken the whole point out but theyre not going to move number one very important theyre not going to move and if they do move were going to make a fortune ok so its ok in fact sometimes you say please move please move wed like you to  wed like you send plenty of product in here when china devalues its currency theyre making it impossible for our companies to compete but china doesnt want  and im very close china i have the biggest bank in the world as a tenant of mine in new york the biggest in the world a chinese bank dont worry about that baby i love babies  i love babies i hear that baby crying and i like  i like it what a baby what a beautiful baby dont worry dont worry the moms running around like  dont worry about it you know its young and beautiful and healthy and thats what we want ok but look  look china when they devalue  when china devalues its currency they take our guts out and they do it so often they do it so often theyre constantly devaluing their currency and they always wait until like its a bad time like we have a problem with iraq we have a problem with afghanistan every time we have like a big problem they always devalue and a year and a half ago they devalued the biggest devaluation theyve done in  years the biggest in  years and i said man how do they get away  but we had a problem  we were doing other things ok so when china does that we have fight back now heres how you fight back because we cant fight back any other way we have the piggy bank they have ripped us to shreds ripped us absolutely to shreds actually i was only kidding you can get the baby out of here  thats all right dont worry i think she really believed me that i love having a baby crying while im speaking thats ok people dont understand thats ok but so you have a situation where a great country like china which is a massive  which has really taken over now if you look you look at the numbers you know a year ago they passed us if you would have said  years ago  years ago that china would be passing us i would have said its absolutely  anybody would have said its impossible weve allowed them to pass us now when we have our manufacturers wanting to go to china they cant get in number one number two if they do get in they have to pay a massive tax when chinese companies want to sell to us no tax come on in fellas were stupid were stupid then they devalued  i had a friend he was catching up with china and he was really starting to compete hes a very very close   conscious guy it was hard for him but hes a really good manufacturer and then all of a sudden they did a massive devaluation  boom  and hes back to ground one its like you know you take two steps forward three steps back guess what happened to him the guys phenomenal he cant get his product into china when he finally starts to be competitive they devalued again and in tpp  now china is not in tpp  but it works the same thing with other countries their single greatest toom  is devaluation of the currency  of their currency we dont even have a clause in the agreement to cover it okay and because of the complexity   pages nobodys going to read it and if you want to get out you cant because theres so many countries involved so i say one one one one one  you do  you do  you do what  everybody and if they dont behave meaning if theyre not good if they take advantage of us we send them what we call a  day notice  please be advised  please be advised we are hereby terminating your agreement with the united states of america  because you cheated you cheated  you cheated on us and heres whats going to happen now were are only dealing with one country we no longer have to worry about you know lets bring this country to the tribunal of all the others countries  nice and simple folks its very complicated to start off with nice and simple so out of the  pages ill bet we dont have one politician in washington thats read even a page and these other countries smart as hell smart countries by the way  these are smart countries theyve read every word every comma every period every paragraph every sentence   they didnt read obamacare shes right well theres an example thank you very much i was just about to say that  no but obamacare is a great example obmacare was like  pages not one politician read it and now were stuck with it but dont worry were going to repeal it and replace it but were stuck with it  it should have died a couple of times it should have died by our supreme court except one of our republican presidents appointed a man who kept obamacare going shockingly right and not one legal scholar can figure it out it should have died the first time and it should have died the second time and we still have it and that was a republican appointee ok and speaking of appointees  because theres been a few beauties   speaking of appointees i am going to appoint great justices of the supreme court great  and  you know i actually told a group last night in pennsylvania i told a group i said  and we had such a crowd we had  we had thousands of people  like outside today i mean you dont believe it outside today seriously we cant use these rooms anymore this is bigger than its ever been its a movement we have going  we have a moment going  but outside  and i told this group i said this big big  you know thousands of people i said listen even if people dont like me they have to vote for me they have no choice  even if you dont  and you do like me i hope but i said even if you cant stand donald trump you think donald trump is the worst youre going to vote for me you know why justices of the supreme court if they pick  if they pick judges were going to end up with another venezuela except just a bigger version its going to be a disaster for this countryd  and ive already chosen  that were vetted and that are so good  these are great justices federalist society looked at them heritage looked at them people that were  are really highly respected and im going to pick from that group and we already have one before we start judge scalia and i want to get as many as i can in the mold of judge scalia because  thats where were looking thats where were looking justice scalia good man and who knew that was going to happen that was a surprise people kept talking about different names but they didnt think him and all of a sudden hes gone that was shocking to people so you never know whats going to happen and ill tell you this could be the presidency with the most supreme court picks of any presidency in history youll probably have three you could have four and you could even have five look we have one before we even start right judge scalia but you could even have five and can you imagine if hillary clinton picks five superlibs because what she is is shes being pushed around by the bernie sanders crowd many of whom are going to vote for us because of our trade policies ok because they understand that trade is killing our country  all right  so i want to go over a couple of facts before i do though i want to just say this look we have a movement going this is beyond anything that anybodys ever seen commentators are saying on television people that hate me are saying on television that they have never seen anything like this they call it the phenomenon its a phenomenon they have never  our crowds are much bigger than bernies were and bernie did good bernie was second i will say that far greater hillary last night in harrisburg where i had i dont know  people we had to send away thousands hillary had  people ok now i dont know what it means i mean maybe it doesnt mean anything i think it should mean something i think it should mean something  i mean when you have crowds that are many many times the size of your opponent i would think that it would mean something but we have these massive crowds i mean i felt so badly about when i went through and im waving to everybody but theyre all standing out there and i feel guilty about it but heres the story we have a movement going its an incredible movement its a movement like they say theyve never seen in this country before and i say it a lot because i have a lot of respect for him bill oreilly he said its the single greatest phenomenon he called it the trump phenomenon its the single greatest phenomenon politically speaking that he has ever seen in his lifetime i mean thats  you know guys seen a lot of stuff right  and bret baier said it bret baier good guy said it and brit hume who said it he doesnt like me too much but he said that or something similar and people have said this that what we are doing is one of the great political phenomena of all time but very importantly its one of the great movements of all time weve got to finish it off weve got to finish it off  weve got to beat  weve got to beat a dishonest machine totally dishonest machine you know as an example how hillary got away with what she got away with recently how do you get away with it everybody thought oh wow shes guilty however now what she got away with was a disgrace honestly a disgrace to our country but she got away with it and who would think that that could have happened and then on top of it she lies on sunday saying oh i was just actually fine i did everything fine and that was not said you know it was said very embarrassingly nobody could believe that happened that whole thing was incredible but we have to learn from itd  its a crooked system its a rigged system were running against a rigged system and were running against a very dishonest media the medias very dishonest its very very dishonest  what they dont take  patty smith  when they dont take pat whose an unbelievable woman and they give her virtually no air time and they give other people unbelievable amounts of air its just so unfair its so unfair were running against a rigged press were running against dishonest people  ok really dishonest people  and  and hey look it was rigged against bernie sanders you could see that from all of those emails debbie wasserman schultz no no but you could see it it was a rigged deal he never had a chance the guy works so hard and now hes got buyers remorse you know you look at him if he would have done nothing if he would have just gone home and gone to sleep he would have been so  because he made a deal with the devil he made a deal with the devil and he made a bad deal and then she picks a vice president thats the exact opposite of everything that bernie represents now i dont agree with what bernie represents but i mean honestly it was almost  percent of their party you would have thought she would have given him a little bit of a bone she gave him nothing she gave him nothing so we have to get everybody out loudon county is so important and really im a big employer here im a big big employer here  and  and everybody in this room  everybody in this room knows how great that project is and how successful its been because many of you  whose been there how many people have been there its one of the great projects in the country all along the potomac river one of the great  thank you  one of the great projects in the country so lets go over a couple of numbers because you have to see this to really believe it and by the way hillary clinton has not had a news conference i think its in  days she doesnt do news conferences because she cant because for a number of reasons but number one shes so dishonest she doesnt want the people peppering her with questions so she doesnt do news conferences its a disgrace i think its  days you know what that is  and she probably wont have one maybe she wont have one maybe well force her to have one but she probably wont have one so listen since  the number of unemployed people in virginia has doubled now these are right out of the book so statisticians ok virginia has lost one in three manufacturing jobs since bill clinton signed nafta signed by bill clinton one of the worst ever ok hillary rammed through the job killing trade deal with south korea in  that south korean deal is a disaster for us but look at the people that give her money and look how their involved in that deal the us trade deficit with tpp members  these are the members going into the transpacific partnership which obama wants which hillary wanted she called it the gold standard but when she heard me talking about it she said she didnt want it but as youre governor said terry mcauliffe governor of virginia he said dont worry dont worry let her get elected and shell approve it shell make a couple of minor changes shell approve itd  this was said then they backpedaled well he doesnt speak  let me tell you terry mcauliffe knows her better than bill knows her terry knows her better than anybody your governor he made this statement ok all right so heres a couple of things that are just sort of amazing president obama has doubled the national debt since hes been in office us trade deficit in goods reached nearly  billion in other words we trade with people you know its funny when i want to make good trade deals the press says oh hes not a free trader im a great free trader i like free trade but i like smart deals somebody said well then what do you call yourself because i know free trade i know fair trade i know every form of trade ever thought up by man believe me its meaningless so they said what are your policies i said my policies are very simple i wanna make great deals for our country ok very simple  you can call it fair trade free trade or any other of the other  ten names i want great deals for our country and i was endorsed by carl icahn some of the greatest business leaders in the world and we have to use our great business people to negotiate the deals because were using political hacks to make deals and its a joke the chinese people look at us like we are the dumbest people they are using their smartest their brightest from the time theyre three years old you know they have like a pyramid right boom boom boom they use the guys right on the top and they walk in and deal with our clowns and they say i cant believe weve gotten away with this for years and years and years weve rebuilt china with our trade weve rebuilt china we have so much power over china and if they dont behave we throw a  percent tax on goods coming in from china we will make a fortune and you know what theyre gonna send the same goods then what are they going to say were not gonna send because were not gonna pay a  percent tax but when they raise their currency  when they do things with their currency they manipulate and they knock out their currency and they devalue their currency and they do all their masters theyre grand masters at currency and a currency manipulation we have the ultimate  we say thank you very much now just so you understand when we send things to china they charge us a tax so people would say donald trump is not a free trader im a free trader but its gotta be a twoway street right i mean its gotta be a twoway street theyre killing us   million americans in their prime earning years are out of the labor force right now in the last seven years another  million people have left the workforce ok nearly  in  african american children are living in poverty while  percent of african american youth are not employed ok two million more latinos are in poverty today than when president obama took office now thank you thank you thank you thank you were gonna bring jobs back  thank you thats very nice were gonna bring jobs back thats why we had a very good poll recently with the hispanics and it was an amazing poll and you know  way up from what people thought because people want jobs and by the way the latinas the hispanics they dont want  and you understand this they dont want people pouring into our country taking their jobs taking their houses they want  they wanna have security they really want the wall they want the wall  were gonna have a strong border and were going have the wall were going have the wall  oh were going build a wall dont even think about it were going build a wall and you know  you know and i say it and i mean it mexicos paying for the wall folks  you know if mexico wanted to they could stop all of the problems that are coming into our country including the drugs new hampshire  which i won  i got to know the people so well up there whats your number one problem heroin coming from the southern border and i said doesnt make sense you go to south carolina north carolina no matter where here you go no matter where we have drugs pouring into our country we could stop it you see our politicians dont wanna stop it because there are people out there that make a lot of money with that and they take care of the politicians they dont wanna stop it they could stop it but mexico could stop it without even us  border patrol agents endorsed me recently ok  sheriff joe endorsed me sheriff joe arpaio  from arizona which is great were gonna get it going but were gonna build a wall mexicos gonna pay for the wall and some politician came up to me number one you cant build a wall i said really china just build a    years ago  built a   china built a  mile long  years ago we have  miles that we need its  miles but we need  you have natural barriers we need  miles so china can do  mils  years ago  and thats the serious wall by the way in case anybody hasnt seen it and we cant do  we cant do a wall thats  miles and we have caterpillar tractors and were gonna use caterpillar by the way were not going with komatsu were not going with komatsu  so here is one of the most depressing stats according to the second quarter gdp report you saw this yesterday the economy only grew at  percent this is the third straight quarter that the economy has grown under two percent and is the single weakest  weakest of any economic expansion in more than  years so we have the weakest expansion in  years and its going back  now its going down because the numbers are getting worse and worse all the time if they get real bad i hope it happens fast so i dont have to  theyll all blame me youll end up winning and your first day the economy crashes because of some incompetent people before me well were gonna straighten up but well certainly blame them ok were going to blame them  no but think of it the weakest in  years  years i mean its terrible now heres another one us home ownership the rate fell of ownership to  percent in the second quarter the lowest rate of home ownership in more than  years terrible did hillary mention any of these facts in her optimistic speech   ok and were not talking about the shooting of the police which by the way is at massive levels massive levels were not talking about crime in major cities our crime is going through the roof you look at whats going on in some of these cities crime is up numbers that you wouldnt even believe they dont talk about that they talk about how everythings wonderful look with hillary youre gonna have four more years of obama and you know what if you have four more years of obama our countries finished its finished  heres one thats an amazing  heres one thats amazing household incomes are more than  lower than their levels in the year  think of it household  youre making  less now than you did   years agod  another one thats very common and out there people  many people in this room  but people are making in terms of real wages less money today than they made  years ago and theyre working two jobs in many cases and thats because of obamacare because obamacare it makes sense for employees to do part time workers so youll have a worker whos worked at a company for years and all of a sudden the boss goes up to him to say i hate to do it with tears and says ive got to make you a part time employee because of obamacare its forced people to be part time employees its a horrible thing thats going on in this country and you didnt hear that in hillary clintons speech you didnt hear that you didnt hear that you heard all is slowing stuff its a disaster and then when you look at other countries how theyve built up their military  look at russia how theyve built up their military take a look at what theyve done take a look at what theyve done on the nuclear weapons front how they built up their military and how were so far behind and our equipment is obsolete in many cases and we have jet fighters that are so old that they have to go to graveyards airplane graveyards and museums to get parts for current jet fighters and we have our pilots our wonderful incredible pilots saying it didnt use to be this way and now theyre older and theyre going to leave and theyre going to retire and they dont want to stay theyre so depressed at whats happened but theyre fighting you saw the report you probably all saw it they had documentaries on television about how old our aircraft is in our services and you have other countries you look at china what theyre doing with their massive with their massive installations that theyre building in oceans south china sea massive we would never even think about it no weve got to get smart folks weve got to get smart were falling way behind  were falling and i can keep reading this stuff its just point after point youre doing lousy over here by the way hate to tell you but point heres recent factory closings in virginia all right right kennametal ball corporation closed kennametal closed sandvik closed moved their jobs to mexico lets see mexico mexico mexico mexico yes smith foods inc closed its plant  workers gone anybody used to work for smithfield   thats true i  its true stanley furniture closed its plant in vista laid off  workers closed its plant moved their jobs to china and canada north carolina has lost so many jobs pennsylvania has lost tremendous numbers of jobs ohio has lost  percent of their manufacturing jobs since chinas entrance into the world trade organization folks what are we doing what are we doing are we  were being led by stupid people folks  and people that are controlled  people that are controlled by special interests and lobbyists so heres the story so weve got to build up our military weve got to make great trade deals i told you that no more when our companies leave they want to  they think theyre going to leave and sell us backproduct from a different company with other employees from other nations not going to happen not going to happen i mean its going to happen but theyre going to pay for it theres going to be consequence theyre going to pay a tax very simple now a lot of people think im not conservative because i want them to pay a tax i think theyre not conservative because theyre stupid d  ok theyre stupid  and by the way its  percent foolproof were not talking about oh maybe it will work can you imagine they used to go around and offer companies loans and its not even funny well give you an interest free loan if you stay and a couple of companies took the money and then left because they forgot to say you had to stay the lawyers didnt do too good a job but look look we have to be the smart people again we have to be  and we dont have much of a choice because we are losing so many of our jobs and we cant take our factories and keep taking our factories and converting them into nursing homes you know nursing homes are wonderful but we have to make things again we need jobs we need jobs its wonderful nursing homes is wonderful but we need jobs  i see things happen where theres a couple of beautiful jobs up in new england theyve taken an old factory theyve converted it into  and its all fine but we cant do that we need manufacturing jobs we need the income we need the productivity we need the future we  as you stand here right now there are companies negotiating from virginia right here theyre negotiating to leave virginia and move to mexico and other places as you stand here some of the people in this room work for companies that are right now under negotiation to get out if i get in that ends hillary wont do anything about it she talks she knows her way now shes talking about trade did you notice two days ago she said ive been talking about were going to renegotiate nafta and if they dont give us a great deal and if we dont re negotiate a great deal were terminating nafta were getting out and well bring our jobs back a different way ok so  the other day now that was like a horrible thing to say two days ago hillary clinton said we are going to start renegotiating our trade deals she cant do it number one if she wanted to she can but they wouldnt let her those people that put up all that money for her those  people and theres plenty of more of them they wont let her do it she cant do it if she wanted to she cant do it so shes just kidding all of you so were going to make america great again  were going to build up our military so depleted were going to take care of our veterans who have been treated horribly  were going to make phenomenal trade deals were going to make trade deals that bring jobs back not trade deals where we lose our businesses and our jobs  were going to have strong borders were going to have the wall mexicos going to pay for the wall and were going to have people come into our country but theyre going to come into our country legally legally  were going to appoint great justices of the united states supreme court  were going to repeal and replace obamacare  we are going to save our second amendment which is under siege  and were going to start winning again folks were going to win on every front i want to thank everybody in loudoun county i love this place im here a lot i want to thank everybody i want to thank everybody in the state of virginia virginia we are going to be here so much youre going to be so sick of me youre going to say please keep him out of here well vote for you but please keep him out im going to be in virginia a lot were going to be here a lot  and just so you know we are going to be proud of our country again were going to put america first we are going to start winning again we are going to make america great again thank you very much thank you folks thank you very much take care everybody"
43,"Trump","i want to tell you you happen to have a truly great governor  and he said something that really caught my imagination he used the term the queen of corruption i think were going to have to  were going to have to use that a little bit she is the queen of corruption  so as you  thank you thank you thank you man  thank you thank you very much its very nice its a very very rambunctious and beautiful crowd i will say  wow thats a lot of people  thats a lot of people so thank you all very much this has just been amazing this has been an amazing an amazing period of time no matter what we do no matter where we go its incredible we were in florida yesterday two tremendous  and just big big arena sold out packed thousands of people outside couldnt get in thats the bad news but this is really nice and i have to tell you i woke up yesterday and i saw  million different currencies  they probably dont want our currency different currencies  million being flown to iran i mean folks whats going on here whats going on what is going on you see it you dont believe it  million in cash is being flown in an airplane to iran i wonder where that money really goes by the way right i wonder where it really goes well it went to one either in their pockets which i actually think more so or toward terrorism probably a combination of both so  million in cash now you really  who  who can authorize even in terms of a president who can authorize  in cash different currencies they didnt want the dollar they wanted different countries different currencies they got a little of everything over there just  spread it around right i mean how stupid are we  how stupid are we to allow this to continue to go on to see whats happening and you know its interesting because a tape was made right you saw that with the airplane coming in nice plane and the airplane coming in and the money coming off i guess right that was given to us  has to be by the iranians and you know why the tape was given to us because they want to embarrass our country they want to embarrass our country and they want to embarrass our president because we have a president whos incompetent they want to  they want to embarrass  they want to embarrass our president i mean who would ever think that they would be taking all of this money off the plane and then providing us with a tape its only for one reason and its very very sad so we have a lot of problems in our country we have border problems people are pouring into our country we have no idea who they are we have people  were going to build a wall folks dont worry about it were building yeah   up here you have tremendous heroin problems you have tremendous problems comes from the southern border but you have tremendous problems and ill tell you what were going to get  so were going to build a wall you know we have another thing we have   you can do whatever you want do whatever you want do whatever you want well you have to say you know a trump rally is the safest place in our country to be believe me  believe me right  we do say but if we keep going the way it is our whole country is becoming different theyre shooting our police at record levels you saw where i said in my speech  percent higher and then they went out and they looked aint that amazing aint that amazing sorta rude  you know when you think of it  and what are we looking for we want strong military we want jobs we want good education health care right  were all like looking for the first were looking for the same thing sort of you want to have a good life you want to have a good life you want safety and then we have people interrupting constantly but actually it hasnt been happening much its happening a little bit today but it hasnt been happening much i sort of missed my protesters you know  and we dont get it from hillary because theres no  you know the bernie people had spirit we dont get it from hillary because they dont care they dont care but you look at whats happening in terms of our police where theyre shooting our police at record levels   percent up and i said  percent its actually much higher than that from last year so we need law and order we have to have it we have to have it  we need law and order we got to protect our police  and our police have to be careful and they have to do their job and they have to do it correctly and they will do it correctly but we have to take care of our police ill tell you theyre really going through a tough time  so i wrote a little thing down that i thought id have because in light of the  million that just got ripped away from our country all right and you know the real number  you look at it  billion we got nothing we got nothing and they think they probably paid the  million for the hostages which is even worse and now since then i dont know if you know we have two more hostages right now why wouldnt they we have two more hostages right now who were fairly recently grabbed and theyre in iran and i guess what are we going to do with that one right so they do  million gets flown at night into iran i think its so sad and so disgusting and you also wonder about a government who can approve a thing like that will they take cash into a country and just hand it to them bushels and bushels of cash and then you look at our country where we owe  trillion as i used to say  used to say  when i started i was saying  and  now its  and  now its going to very soon be  its going to be  very soon because we have a budget that is very very expensive but it doesnt take good care of our military our military is depleted and we have to fix our military and i know for the  for the navy  one of the reporters was talking about  one of the reporters  how do you feel about building ships because you have a lot of ships youre building up here good ones right  so our navy as you know has one of the lowest numbers of ships that theyve had in decades and decades and weve got to rebuild our navy weve got to rebuild our whole military folks and were going to do it  probably almost never have needed it more than we need it now with all of the people out there that dont like us very much and were going to be very strong were going to be very smart were going to build up our military its so depleted were going to take care of our vets were going to take care of our vets  our vets  our vets are so badly treated you look at whats going on where they wait on the line six seven eight days think of it youre not a vet think of it in the audience think of it six seven eight days people are dying on the line waiting for doctors and committing suicide the suicides are at numbers that nobody has ever thought possible were going to take care of our vets i put a plan and people are loving the plan  people are loving the plan and if youre waiting if youre waiting on the line for an extended period of time youre going to walk outside youre going to go to a doctor whos looking for business youre going to go to a hospital private or public youre going to get taken care of and its going to be less expensive the government is going to pay the bill its going to be far less expensive than whats been happening people are dying waiting on the line for a simple pill or a simple prescription they are dying our great veterans are dying waiting on the line and were not going to do it were not going to do it  no more no more so i wrote a few things down and i  to isis ok huge portions we dont know is isis coming into our country with all of the people that are pouring in we have no idea who they are we have absolutely no  you know the harm they want to inflict you look at whats taking place in our country  san bernardino and orlando and look at what  whats going on all over the world i mean look at the world trade center look at whats happening look at whats happening oh boy the wildlife so you look at what weve sacrificed and what weve given up and the level of viciousness where heads are being chopped off where people are being drowned in steel cages we havent seen this since medieval times i mean you know i love history we talk about medieval times and you would never have thought you would have seen the things were seeing today and its gotten out of control and obama has let it get out of control and then you have hillarys made tremendous mistakes in every way i guarantee you this if obama had it to do again he would have never picture  never as secretary of state because he has gotten  into such trouble with the decision that she probably made or convinced him to make that its ridiculous so the obamaclinton foreign policy has handed huge portions of iraq libya and syria to isis i mean huge portions undermining the stability and strength in egypt and empowered iran as never before iran is like this major power and when they made this horrible deal why didnt they solve other problems with iran you know iran is fighting us in other places right theyre fighting us in other places why we didnt we say wait a minute were giving you back all of this money were giving you all it is a horrible deal in every way we got nothing in that deal we got our hostages back and now we find out what we actually paid for the hostages and it was in cash which is terrible because that sets a terrible terrible precedent and its just sickening and youll have four more years of obama if you elect hillary clinton  four more years the most important issues facing civilization right now is radical islamic terrorism and we have a president  we have a president that wont use the term wont say it he wont say it maybe he doesnt believe it he right now thinks that global warming is the greatest threat that this world has so weve just seen many many crimes getting worse all the time and as maine knows a major destination for somali refugees right am i right well theyre all talking about it  maine somali refugees we admit hundreds of thousands you admit into maine and to other places in the united states hundreds of thousands of refugees and theyre coming from among the most dangerous territories and countries anywhere in the world right a practice which has to be  has to stop has to stop this isnt like youre smarter than other people or  this is a practice that has to stop not like we say oh lets do something we want to be nice and we want to  as in the case of syria well build safe havens well do something well get other nations that are near the gulf states as an example they dont spend money  they dont spend money they dont take people we take people they dont take people and theyre right there to spend money believe me folks theyre going to spend money they wouldnt be there if it werent for us so the washington times reported of a somali refugee program in minnesota that the effort to resettle large groups of somali refugees is having the unintended consequence of creating an enclave of immigrants with high unemployment that is both stressing the states  i mean the state is having tremendous problems  its safety net and creating a rich pool of potential recruiting charges for islamist terror groups its happening  its happening you see it happening you read about it you see it and you could be smart and you can be cunning and tough or you can be very very dumb and not want to see whats going on folks all you have to do is take a look at whats happening in germany ok its a mess its a mess  take a look  take a look at whats happening in france take a look at whats happening in france two weeks ago nice  you remember in paris in paris we had the disaster  people viciously violently killed and by the way if you had some guns on the other side of that equation it wouldnt happen believe me you wouldnt have had the tragedy that you have  remember this hillary clinton essentially wants to take away your rights under the second amendment she wants to take away your guns she wants to take away those bullets she wants to take away your rights now the national rifle association not only endorsed me they endorsed me i think earlier than anybody they have ever endorsed  we need to protect our second amendment we have to do it we have to do it believe me  believe me youre going to have things happening with you  if she gets in remember justices of the supreme court  very important  so it goes along with that second amendment because theyll be ruling very negatively  if you put her there very important i said to a friend of mine i said well you have to vote hes a democrat so you have to vote for me why number one im your friend  he said youll be the first republican ill ever voted for thats ok but i said justices of the supreme court she will put because she was forced so far left she will put super super liberal judges into what could be four or five slots i mean you have one before youve even started  judge scalia whos terrific but you have a situation where she could have or the next president could have as many as five more likely it will be three or four but its going to be perhaps a record number of justices of the supreme court and if no other reason you have to go out and you have to vote for trump right  so just few other instances the boston bombers remember the boston bombers what a horrible thing that was arrived through the political asylum process right the younger brother applied for citizenship and was naturalized on september   the older brother had a pending application for citizenship oh thats wonderful we take them right we take them and you see what happened how violent and how vicious and how horrible was that ok and if theyre not here we dont have that incident which killed so many and so badly wounded so many and what i said  and what i said is so true so many of these  you look at san bernardino what i said is so true second amendment if guns a couple one where on one of the people two of the people three of the people in san bernardino so the bullets are flying in the opposite direction number one they probably would not have made the attack  and number two if they were  right and number two the carnage  and it was carnage  people killed many many people in the hospital even to this day it wouldnt have happened or it certainly would have been a lot less and we have to get smart this is the way the world works and we have to get smart and you know in paris where they walked in  and the same with san bernardino they walked in no guns they knew and they go boom boom get over boom boom boom  the other case  and we have many other cases and this is all over the world now this is now all over the world and we are letting people come in from terrorist nations that shouldnt be allowed because you cant vet them theres no way of vetting them you have no idea   this could be the great trojan horse of all time  a moroccan national who came to the united states on a student visa was arrested for plotting to blow up a university and a federal courthouse ubek  you know where that is you know where it is uzbek refugee living in idaho was arrested and charged with providing support to a terrorist organization in the form of teaching terror and this is what they do  teaching terror recruits how to build bombs wonderful wonderful i dont want them in this country wonderful wonderful  and by the way you got to turn these people in you got to turn  you know when you go to san bernardino they had bombs all over the floor of the apartment people saw those bombs they didnt turn them in those people are guilty of a crime believe me  an immigrant from syria who later applied and received united states citizenship was accused by federal prosecutors of planning to go to a military base in texas and killed three or four american soldiers but preferably execution style were dealing with animals  preferably execution style a college student who immigrated from somalia who later applied for and received us citizenship attempted to blow up a christmas tree with the lighting at a major ceremony in oregon an immigrant from afghanistan who later applied for and received us citizenship and a legal permanent resident from the philippines were convicted for plotting to join alqaeda and the taliban in order to kill as many americans as possible hillary clinton wants to have them come in by the hundreds of thousands just remember this has nothing to do with politics folks this is a whole different level this has to do with pure raw stupidity ok  an iraqi immigrant who later applied for and received us citizenship was arrested for lying to federal agents about pledging allegiance to isis and has traveled to syria wanted to kill as many americans as possible didnt care how didnt care how any way he could do it two immigrants from pakistan who later applied for and received us citizenship were sentenced to decadeslong prison terms for plotting to detonate a bomb in the middle of new york city an immigrant from yemen who were by the way were fighting  were fighting were working  were working with one side we have no idea who this side is you know we spend billions and billions on equipment and guns and rifles and then the enemy has them we spend millions and tens of millions of dollars on all of this equipment and as soon as the shots fired you know we always go  we always seem to pick the wrong side in terms of winning because we dont win anymore but you know iran is on the other side of that right so you say to yourself why  you know they want yemen because of the border between saudi arabia they dont want yemen they want what they want as they want the oil in saudi arabia they have a very beautiful big big drill when they look at it right so here we are  billion and you say to yourself why and they ask secretary of state kerry why didnt they solve that problem were fighting and our side is fighting people led by iran why didnt you solve that problem why didnt you make a deal when youre making this horrible deal that you made while we lost everything we didnt get anything thats a deal we didnt get anything they say nuclear weapons theyll have nuclear weapons much faster because of that deal than they would have had them otherwise and now they can buy them with all the money they get and they can buy them what do they have to do with them they can buy them theyll have nuclear weapons believe me ive called a lot of shots right mostly believe me mostly ive called them  just about all right including not going into iraq in the first place and destabilizing the middle east but when secretary kerry who is probably better than crooked hillary but who knows they both terrible but when he said  and when the president asked them about this why didnt they solve their problem when they solved the other he said it got too complicated ok got too complicated heres what we have really complicated get out we dont want to fight over there were going to solve  you solve the problem or you dont solve the problem all right an immigrant from yemen who later applied for and received us citizenship was arrested for trying to join isis he was also charged with attempting to illegally buy firearms and to try and shoot american military personnel as many as possible ok these are people we have coming into our country and by the way they are the ones we know about there are so many that we dont know about youre going to have problems like youve never seen just like i said the one thing i predicted i predict is youre going to have problems like youve never seen we dont know where these people are you know when the government puts them around we dont even for the most part very few people know where they even are they dont even know where they are located im telling you i said it before this could be the great trojan horse of all time theyre coming in theyre coming in  and you have many more like that many more  thousands thousands thousands we have more people right now being looked at by the fbi and others than weve ever had in the history of our country ok and its impossible to do this thousands of people are being looked at and studied thousands and this is what were living with and she wants to allow  percent more than obama has allowed coming into the country so if you want to  if you want to let her do it folks thats going to be your choice but i think youre making a very big mistake hillary clinton furthermore can never be trusted with national security  cant  in fact were both supposed to be briefed in a not too distant future and im saying you cant brief her  you cant brief her lets protest her email scandal put our entire country at risk made our sensitive secrets vulnerable to hacking by foreign adversaries i mean they hacked all over the place they hacked i guess whos got them she lost  emails what happened thirtythree thousand ok so what  what happened how is it possible first of all what kind of a number is that she said it was the wedding and yoga  and then they accused her of lying they said she lied they said she was negligent  all these things and the other day this weekend she went out and said no no no i think you must have misunderstood shes a big problem i mean shes  shes  i dont know theres something going on there look look she has got a problem did you see this weekend when she was interviewed she said no i think you misunderstood no were doing a lot ive never seen  has anyone ever seen a liar like that ever before shes made everybody less safe those  emails are potentially a danger to our country and if anybody thinks that was for a wedding and for yoga and when she got away with that i said thats probably the greatest accomplishment that she has ever had in politics  and i think its a great insult to our country i think its a tremendous insult to our country and to law enforcement i see policemen and they come up to me and the policemen like me for whatever reason ok maybe because i like them  and theyre shaking their head theyre saying mr trump was so embarrassed its such an embarrassment what took place thirtythree thousand deleted or gone remember they used to say wiped the server and what about the server what about the server how did that happen how did that happen and then they put petraeus and destroyed his life over nothing by comparison and many others  and she walks and then the president has a meeting for  minutes with a very important person in the back of an airplane and they talked about grandchildren and golf no its sad and then deleted the emails to cover up her crime  she deleted them to cover up her crime folks  percent not  percent  a hundred percent she deleted those emails to cover up what could be a major crime and it is actually a major crime i would watch it i would read and i found it very interesting i think the reason bernie sanders may be lost because it was so close and you know its a rigged system to start off with ok with the super delegates  and i said he was going to  but that day in the debate when he said no no lets not worry about the emails lets get you know it sounded so nice as a sound bite had he gone the other way and had he demanded something it would have been a whole different story i think thats when he lost his primary election i really do i believe that  so in any line he did sold out by the way no offense i know we have some bernie sanders people here actually do we have bernie sanders people here i hear we do yes  so were going to get a lot of bernie sanders votes because of trade because bernie sanders was right about one thing that i really believe  not i believe in its a fact we are dying with our trade deals our trade deals are a disaster our trade deals with other countries  were going to lose almost  billion this year in trade deficits with other countries china alone  billion he was right on that he was right on that but had bernie sanders not made that deal and he made the deal with the devil ive said it before had he not made that deal  and then she picked a vice presidential candidate tim kaine  tim kaine now i thought hed be a really popular guy because i just left virginia i was in loudoun county virginia we had a tremendous crowd of people  tremendous crowd great people i think that hed  you know really a popular guy he wasnt popular you know when he was governor of virginia in the first week he raised taxes by  billion does anyone know that and unemployment doubled unemployment doubled under his governorship i mean  and i said oh gee are we going to have to sacrifice virginia and people said no i think you probably just won virginia hes not popular at all  not popular at all and  and by the way we have a great vice president  we have a great  mike pence  mike pence from indiana aaa rating one of the most incredible stories for any state indiana great state great people bobby knight endorsed me that was the end of that right  bobby knight great guy eight hundred   wins but bobby knight is terrific but indiana the job that mike pence has done there has been amazing i mean hes aaa bond rating you dont see that very often not many states have that unemployment was just  it was terrible it was out of control then he  and the previous republican governor good guy they  the job they have done has been absolutely astounding its one of the reasons i picked it maybe the primary reason now im seeing the incredible job he did he came to me called me the other day he said do you mind because he likes paul ryan paul ryan is a good guy actually paul ryan is  no hes a good guy so mike called me and he said  yesterday and he said would you mind if i endorsed i wont do that if it could cause any complications or problems i would absolutely not hes the greatest guy hes the greatest human being and he said that he said  but i like him hes a friend of mine would you mind if i endorsed him and i will not do it if you say no i said mike you like him yes go ahead and do it  percent and he endorsed him  and then  and then we have like a great relationship its short but you know it hasnt been that long but ive known him through the campaign and then a couple of the papers not all of them i must say most of them wrote it legitimately but a couple of them said theres a fissure between pence and trump theres a fissure its so dishonest these newspapers the media folks they are so dishonest there is nothing so dishonest theres nothing  really so  so she deleted the emails to cover up her crime she lied about it all over and over and over and over and most recently she lied to chris wallace of fox i mean it was a pure lie anybody that saw that interview they wouldnt even believe it if i ever did that interview and if i ever gave that answer i want to tell you i think id get the electric chair i swear i think i will  it would be headlines all over the world its true  double standard this isnt a  this is a quadruple standard seriously if i ever gave the answer that she gave to chris wallace it would be  honestly it would be pretty close to execution and you know what maybe worse horrible headlines ok  horrible its amazing you know when she said that i said oh this is going to be a big story its a story but not very big its lingering though its lingering you know its sort of like one of those things you cant get rid of it right its lingering but the press wants to get rid of it but its lingering and its out there she lied  boy has she lied meanwhile the obamaclinton economic disaster  its an economic disaster  has brought suffering across the nation nearly four in  africanamerican youth are living in poverty another two million latinos have joined the ranks of those in poverty nearly one in four people in their prime working years are now not working you see the numbers the numbers are very  theyre out there for everyone to see the obamaclinton economy has been a total disaster for all working people but especially people in the inner cities especially were going to bring back our jobs folks were going to bring them back  hillary clinton and ive been saying this for a long time hillary clinton works only for her donors special interests and lobbyists you have lobbyists that have stamped on their forehead i can produce hillary so  and theyre very good and they raise millions of dollars did you see yesterday it was announced that hillary clinton got  million or so from hedge funds and donald trump got  from hedge funds or   im trying to figure out who they were i want to give it back  who is it folks folks look there was nobody better at the game or certainly much better at the game than i was i was on the other side for a long time dont forget on june  i was established  on june  when i announced that i was running coming down that now very famous escalator with melania i announced  she did a great job  did a great job with her speech she did and ivanka did and eric did and don did and tiffany did  great job they did a great job thank you thats so  im going to tell them about those im going to tell them about this  wow thats so nice thats so nice im going to tell them about this theyll be happy they worked hard on it and they were good they worked hard i think a couple of them now want to be politicians they felt so good up there right i told them dont  dont do it its not but you know speaking of politicians weve created a movement we have a movement going on like they havent seen in this country  where major anchors and major political figures have said what trump has done meaning what we have done together  its a movement  is perhaps the greatest political phenomenon theyve seen in their lifetime  and i dont want to think about it i just want to keep going but ill tell you everywhere we go we have crowds like this we have  i mean its only constrained by the size of the theater or the arena you had to see  honestly you had to see florida last night you had to see  thank you i love you too darling  you had to see  you had to see what was going on in pennsylvania the love that was in pennsylvania who have been stripped of their jobs the nafta  the nafta has been a disaster signed by bill clinton the nafta has stripped pennsylvania of so many of their jobs stripped everybody stripped you folks too but hillary clinton works only for our donors and special interests and you know that and her whole life the clinton foundation  you ever seen this the clinton foundation like saudi arabia gives  million of the clinton foundation right and  and then you wonder and people naively say will she be good for the energy business yes shes going to be good for the energy business in saudi arabia shes going to make it impossible for our energy business and thats the way it works i mean its a sad thing she is going to be so good for the energy business of saudi arabia look taxes im going to cut your taxes in half  were going to cut your taxes we have the biggest tax decrease proposed by anybody running for the presidency that includes all of the republicans all of the democrats we have the biggest one we are by far the biggest one so were going to have much lower taxes were going to cut our taxes very importantly were going to cut our taxes for the middle class were going to cut our taxes for business  were going to have massive dollars pouring into this country and were going to create jobs like weve never seen before taxes are so high  that businesses cannot produce jobs and one other thing which is actually more important to these people  to everybody  regulations regulations are so bad they are so out of control that when i go around  and it surprises me frankly when i go around and i look at taxes and regulations people if they could only have one they would cut the massive regulations they cant start businesses  and businesses they have cant thrive so were going to take that out yeah were going to take that out we are going to make our country strong again were going to make our country powerful again  you saw the two jetfighters that went down in the last short period of time theyre old theyre old theyre tired it was just announced today two fighters went down theyre old theyre tired these are all fighters we sell fighters to other nations that are far better than what we have we dont have  look folks we  when we fix a part for some of our jetfighters that were currently using they have to go to the plane graveyards they call them airplane graveyards to take them off old planes because they dont make the parts anymore theyre too old we go to museums and take parts out of planes this is what were using to fight this is the united states of america this is what were using so heres what were going to do ive been up here a lot ive been to maine a lot smaller number of you know what  we have a smaller  what is it four four right four so we have  but ive been here a lot because we have such incredible people up here we have people that like donald trump  like donald trump we have people up here that are very very proud of their country they want to see great things happen they know great things are going to happen  they know great things are going to happen and  and they want to see our country be safe and we want to see safety but were going to see many things were going to see many things and we want to see if we can win the whole state somebody was saying not four but youll get one and somebody else was saying you know what i think you can get all four  i think you can get all four so well see well see but as everybody knows and i say it and nobody ever challenges me you know when i was young i was going to high school and we had wars but we never lost a war we had never lost a war then all of a sudden you had the vietnam war and you had other wars and you had  now we never win anything we never win anything we dont win anymore we dont win with trade we dont win for our vets we got to take care of our vets we got to take great care of our vets  our military we cant beat isis we cant beat isis can you imagine general douglas mcarthur can you imagine general patton these were tough tough cookies and we had those people we have them  how about general flynn we love general flynn right  mike flynn we have those people but i guess were not using them i guess were not using them we cant defeat isis so heres the story folks yes we can youre right  very quickly who said that that was very good thank you thanks so were going to start winning again were going to win on trade were going to win with our military were going to knock the hell out of isis were going to win for our vets  were going to win for our vets were going to win at the border and were going to build this beautiful beautiful powerful big wall  and mexico is going to pay for that wall mexico is going to pay they know it mexico is going to pay for the wall and thats an easy one and you know why theyre going to pay because mexico is making a fortune the trade deficit im not talking about the drugs pouring across ok were not even including that  massive amounts of drugs you know when i won new hampshire i made a pledge whos from new hampshire here i love them so i made a pledge because i went around and it never made sense to me you know you see new hampshire and you dont associate the beautiful streams and  and all of the beautiful things that you see there even the little roadways and  and the forests the lakes and i said to the people of new hampshire whats the biggest problem they said heroin they said heroin it just doesnt look like it right am i right and i got to know the people and we had a tremendous victory in  that was my first victory  first victory politically  amazing people and i said to the people of new hampshire and if i win were going to stop this poison from flowing in and destroying your children and others  and thats what were going to do we need to stop it and then we have to help the people that are hooked because you have many many people in this community in new hampshire all over  all over the country not just new hampshire but somehow new hampshire because it just didnt seem like you know its so delicate so beautiful this is so beautiful who would think that youre loaded up with drugs in maine and theyre coming mostly from the southern border were going to stop it  percent were going to stop it were going to stop it  and then were going to work with people to get them unhooked we got to get them unhooked theres tremendous problems we got to get them unhooked and thats all over the country by the way but i really learned more about that problem from new hampshire than any place else so heres the story folks were going to start winning again were going to save our second amendment were going to get rid of common core youre going to have your education locally  you have your education locally save our second amendment and the bottom line is this you are going to be again very very proud of your country  very important youre going to be hopefully very proud of your president  were going to win again were going to win at every level and were going to make america safe again were going to make america first remember we dont make america first not anymore we dont make america were more worried about other nations than we are ourselves thats why theyre ripping us off were using the wrong people were going to make america first we are going to make america great again thank you thank you everybody  thank you  thank you everybody"
44,"Trump","so how good is he how good is he  special special he is a special man and special person and he has become my friend oh there is a lot of people here whoa  hello everybody your football team is going to have a great year  i watch i watch youve got the quarterback youve got the whole deal i think its going to be a very good year  ok and if you get into that super bowl i will be going all right so you know i wrote something down before and i think it is important because  i love you too  because we need unity we have to win this election this is truly one of the most important elections certainly in my lifetime because we are about to go  we lose it we are in the wrong direction and maybe its gone supreme court justices always remember that but so many different levels and when you see what happened with crooked hillary today it was a disaster  a disaster she had a disaster she lies folks she lies   so i want to  i just wrote this out i wanted to say to the group you know i had a great time when i was in wisconsin and i did not quite eke it out i thought i was going to but after that it worked out well you built me up you taught me about politics and when i left here i said i think ive learned a lot  so i love it i love the people i have many friends in wisconsin and theyre  theyre incredible people youre incredible people i have to tell you that  and were going to have a lot of fun we are going to have a lot of fun  this campaign is not about me or any one candidate it is about america  it is time for a change we need a change a real change not an obama change we dont need an obama change we have had enough it is time to change a rigged political system that works only for the insiders and replace it with a government that serves the people  have to do it and know both sides ive been on the other side believe me i actually like this side better this is a movement this is a movement like they may be have never seen in this country according to even the political pundits that truly hate me ok this is a  they  oh this is a movement that some say most say is one of the great phenomenons that theyve ever seen in politics some say its the single greatest phenomenon  though the media doesnt want to talk about it we have done something  we all of us together im a messenger im only a messenger we have done something truly historic together standing before you as nominee for president and im not a politician proudly  im not part of the system i ran against the system and im probably better off running against the system  i ran against the donors im my own donor essentially i have a lot of money under this deal this is a very expensive crisis i want to tell you  i funded  as you know i funded the primaries and im in for under  million and im largely funding my campaign as we go forward in addition to that  in addition to that we have raised tremendous amounts of money and much of it from small donors  as a republican that doesnt happen it happens because of what you are seeing in front of you today and if you remember just prior to june they did a story donald trump has not really done too well with fund raising well that is because i did not even know if i was getting the nomination im not going to raise funds  i wouldve had enough if i didnt make it i would have said bye bye politics but i wanted to make sure  so i got it and then i started raising money for the republican party and we raised a lot of money we started really on june th flag day my birthday my birthday  and in june we raised approximately  think of this   million can you imagine  and those people couldnt believe it they were really surprised big headlines you know because they dont give me too many good headlines i could do the greatest things i do things that i think a fantastic i say good there is no way they cover this badly and they cover it badly i gently tell a woman that i love her baby and let the baby cry it is ok as the baby that had a voice that was superior to pavarotti continued to cry  i remember i told her to stay dont worry maam but after about  or  minutes and im trying to speak and it was in jacksonville we had this massive massive crowd filled up the stadium and the babys screaming so i said maam i would like to reverse my order perhaps you could nicely take  take the baby out your baby is great i did it so nicely she was happy even the baby was happy he stopped crying  and maybe you could take the baby out would that be possible the whole place was cracking up and the next day in the newspaper it said trump throws baby out of arena terrible now they are very dishonest that was a tough one when i  and i just had a reporter come up to me backstage a reporter come up  mr trump sir but why did you throw that baby out of the area i said i was having fun i was so nice i was so nice everybody likes me the baby liked me the mother liked me we had a good time i try to keep the baby in but the baby was such  had such a powerful voice  in fact i want to find out who that baby is because i want to sponsor the baby and that baby will sing someday in philharmonic hall im telling you new york city ok the great philharmonic  so im not part of the system i ran against the system i ran against the donors because im largely my own donor im running against myself thats sort of  never thought of it that way and against the status quo and the status quo we have to get rid of because it is not working folks because the country is a mess  and that is why put up a lot of money but while the democrats nominated the candidate of special interests and really a candidate of total corruption i mean you take a look at what she is doing the republicans made history by choosing a nominee from outside of this very very corrupt the system it is a corrupt system its a corrupt system you want something done they couldnt  do it for you and that is not necessarily and usually it isnt good for the country that is why were going to be able to deliver real change and real safety and real opportunity to all americans we have to unite remember that everything ive accomplished i have done by putting together a really fantastic team including governor mike pence of indiana who has done an incredible  done an incredible job my wonderful staff of people that really love what we are doing and they are working so hard my family friends and its expanding all the time but i need a republican senate and a house to accomplish all of the changes that we have to make we have to make them right  i understand and embrace the wisdom of ronald reagans big tent within the party big big tent remember ronald reagan great man great guy remember he included reagan democrats and independents and republicans a lot of people were going to have the same thing there a lot of democrats perhaps in this room are there a lot of democrats raise your hands i mean i dont think we need too many to be honest with you but  so i embraced the wisdom that my  percent friend is not my  percent enemy ronald reagan  stated by ronald reagan pretty good we will be the big tent party we are going to have a lot of cross help we are going to have a lot of bernie sanders people coming in because of trade because bernie sanders knew we were being ripped off by trade trade is a disaster with china with japan with mexico with vietnam with so many countries with every country every country we dont win at any level with anything and as a unified party we will lead our country to unity as well very important we need the unity we have to win the election  no we have to win it  have to win it otherwise our big movement was not as big as we thought and thats not good thats why november th youve got to get everybody you know  and you know all this voter id nowadays a lot of places arent going to have voter id now what does that mean what does that mean you just keep walking in and voting so you have to be very careful very vigilant  you have to be careful but we will have disagreements but we will disagree as friends and never stop working together toward victory and very importantly toward real change  so in our shared mission to make america great again i support and endorse our speaker of the house paul ryan  paul ryan hes good hes a good man hes a good man and hes a good guy and we may disagree on a couple of things but mostly we agree and were going get it done and were going to do a lot of wonderful things  hes a good man and while im at it i hold in the highest esteem senator john mccain for his service to our country in uniform and in public office and i fully support and endorse his reelection very important  well work together i also fully support and endorse senator kelly ayotte of new hampshire  a state i truly love primarily because that was my first victory but i love new hampshire no i love new hampshire one of the most beautiful places shes a rising star and will continue to represent the great people of new hampshire so very well for a long long time senator kelly ayotte  working handinhand we will grow our majority in the house and in the senate we need that weve got to get things done arm in arm we will rescue the nation from the obamaclinton disaster which is exactly what it is that has bled our country dry and spread terrorism unabated across the world thats whats happening you saw it just now maps came out yesterday they said isis far bigger its all over the place its all over the place were going to get rid of it folks  our military is depleted were going to build up our military we are going to get others with us believe me were going to get plenty of others with us and speaking of others wouldnt it actually be wonderful if we could get along with russia wouldnt that be nice  they talk so big and so brave and so tough theyre the tough ones you know hillarys real tough give me a break wouldnt that be great we get along with russia we go out together with others and we knock the hell out of isis wouldnt that be great  together we will lead our country back to prosperity security and peace ok when you look at the world and whats happened  so we have the queen of corruption shes the queen of corruption she is a disaster i said before if crooked hillary clinton becomes president terrorism will destroy the inner workings of our country believe me they are loving it she wants to have  percent more people coming in from syria and that region into our nation and we dont know who they are we dont know where they come from really we dont know if theyre isis some will be and look at the damage thats done in san bernardino with a couple  probably he became radicalized by her  a couple and these were friends of theirs these were people that gave a party in celebration of the birth of their child and they were gunned down  people killed many many injured take a look at orlando  take a look at orlando how disgusting that was take a look at the world trade center and so many other places go to the probably toughest gun laws anywhere in the world go to paris and take a look at that  people gunned down you know if people had guns on the other side where the bullets are flying in the other direction like you sir you sir you and you maam  first of all if they knew guns were in the room they probably wouldnt have gone there there were no guns they were just sitting ducks  people in san bernardino you had  people but in paris just like this boom  get over here boom  get over here boom   people with many still in the hospital many so gravely wounded its horrible and if they had bullets flying in the other direction maybe they wouldnt have shown up and if they did ill tell you what you wouldnt have had that kind of carnage you would have had people lying on the other side of the floor instead  so hillary clinton wants to do major damage as you know to our second amendment hillary clinton wants to put judges  she wants to put justices of the supreme court  shes going to make them nice and liberal wait until  wait until you see what that does to your rights wait until you see what that does to your second amendment you will not recognize it you will not recognize it national rifle association nra endorsed me  theyre great people wayne  theyre great people chris they love this country they endorsed me very early and its really a  its really an honor ill tell you what they are phenomenal people when you get to know them they love the country  you know they love the country they take a lot of heat but they love the country ill tell you that right now and i heard mike governor pence talking about  growth   percent growth the lowest in memory since the s when you think about it its the lowest so a lot of differences between all of us but i thought i would mention  because ive known hillary clinton over the years  i know her  and she makes statements she makes statements and they are statements coming out of her playbook well lets see we cant get them for this  cant get them for this ive always heard that i have the best temperament people tell me i have the best temperament i have a temperament to win we got to win we got to win  she said not so long ago i dont like donald trumps tone now she is reading it off teleprompters only i dont like donald trumps tone and i said you know we need a tough tone today we have people  we need a kind tone but we need a tough tone we have people being beheaded all over the middle east and other places we have crime that is rampant we have people in the middle east being drowned in steel cages this is like medieval times and she is worried about my tone so they chop off heads and they drown people and they bury people in sand and then they ask me mr trump sir  at one of the debates in which i won im very happy about that  mr trump sir how do you feel about waterboarding im seeing chopped off heads drowned people burying in sand  i said im absolutely ok with it let me tell you  can you imagine what the enemy must say  can you imagine the enemy  isis in this case  can you imagine what they must say as they spent the day chopping off the heads of christians  come back get together and start talking  and they say waterboarding is not allowed in the united states  by the united states waterboarding is not allowed folks we better get smart and tough and we are playing games with hillary we are playing games it is just games she is not the right person and everybody knows it her single greatest achievement is being caught in a crime and getting away with it  this is true  emails  so i wrote this before on the way over to another rally at also a very nice place thats very full and very nice in iowa and we love iowa dont we yes right  i thought it was accurate unstable  and she is she is unstable hillary clinton lacks the judgment that bernie sanders had you just have to pay attention as soon as he said it i started writing notes she has bad judgment she lacks the judgment temperament and moral character to lead this country plus she is a weak person we dont need a weak person he just said plus she is a criminal she is a dangerous liar who has disregarded the lives of americans and who has put all of us at great risk while supporting economic policies that have destroyed our economy we have a long way to go she is unhinged shes truly unhinged and she is unbalanced totally unbalanced and you can see in the words of a secret service agent who just wrote a book i bought the book i wanted to see what he had to say she simply lacks the integrity and temperament to serve in the office from my bottom of my soul he said i know this to be true he was there her leadership style volcanic impulsive as it is disdainful of the rules set for everyone else hasnt changed a bit shes unqualified to become president and she really is and bernie said that too  thank you what great people wow no but it is true no games it is true in one way she is a monster ok look at what happened look at her history in another way she is a weak person she is actually not strong enough to be president so shes got both but she is not strong enough to be president she will be a be a disaster she will be so bad for our country and im not just talking about justices of the supreme court she will be so bad for our country and we cant let it happen we cant let it happen you know mike pence told me a story and maybe i should not say it but i found it interesting but of the reasons  i guess the primary reason that hes in politics is because he watched the crookedness of the clintons when they were in the white house and he said he ran he ran again and he ran again and he won you have to hand it to him this is the guy that does not give up he does not quit he never ever quits  but he watched the clintons  and im sure they will be thrilled to hear that  but that actually got him into politics which is interesting so then we make these horrible deals iran deal horrible deal we got  billion  and how about  million  think of it  million in cash different currencies different denominations now lot of people say that money went toward terror im nicer than that see i dont have that horrible thought process that some people have in this room have i say some of it went to terror but a lot of it went into their bank accounts believe me thats the way it is it went into their pockets can you imagine these guys sitting there with  million in cash you think theyre giving that money to terror they are giving that money to them and i guess terror got some of it but most of it they kept i mean the concept of paying  million in cash is mind boggling i mean you wouldnt think  who can authorize such a thing where did they get it what did they do go to a bank teller and say give me  million in cash i want to in euros i want it in swiss francs wrap it up we will come back in  minutes i mean it is just inconceivable so we are witnessing a horror show in this country and throughout the world you look at what is going on throughout the world with these same people these people funding terror  these people are funding terrorism for us to have given  million to basically free our hostages now obama just like he lied about obamacare which was a tremendous lie that was a tremendous lie remember you can keep your plan you can keep your doctor really how many people have been able to keep the doctor or their plan keep your plan keep your doctor  not working that way folks it is a disaster by the way it is going to be repealed and replaced  percent  and  and honestly i hope i win because we will do a great job we are going to make america great again were going to make america great again  but i actually think that regardless of who wins obamacare is going to fold in any event it is so expensive people cant afford it and the country cant afford it other than that it is just wonderful so in texas they just had almost a  percent increase now the increases are starting to come out the big increase is going to be announced on november st the election is november th folks they want to delay it because it is electionchanging it is a mess it is election changing and they want to change it and we cant let that happen because the numbers  and i can see some of the numbers already  the numbers are going to be astronomical they are going to be astronomical theyre going to be so big so horrible and the health care you know the plan is terrible its terrible and were going to take care of everybody but were going to end up with a great plan that costs much less money for the people and much less money for the country this plan is a total rip it does not work so its going to fall because economically it is a disaster for the country too but what about people where they said they had a     percent increase and its going to be worse than that i predict on november st so wed better get smart and wed better start thinking properly now i want to talk about what is going on at the borders because money  oh were going to build it   so listen so we have people coming to our country that should not be coming to our country  we have thousands and thousands of people from certain terrorist states from certain parts of the world that we are allowing to come into our country most of the politicians almost all of them dont even know where they are where they are being put they know nothing about these people this could be the great trojan horse of all time and hillary wants thousands more to come in over and above obama right so tall  and the wall is getting taller every day  if you think of this i just wrote this the obamaclinton foreignpolicy has handed huge portions of iraq libya and syria to isis huge portions it has undermined stability in egypt and you know what they have to do over there and empowered iran as never before iran three years ago was  was dying in fact when they were marching in the streets if obama would have just encouraged them a little more it would have been taken over by the people but obama played ball with the thugs that are running it right now think of this think of this look look were making a deal and the deal is not made and they are dancing in the streets of iran saying how stupid the americans are to be making this deal the leaders and in particular the leader of iran is calling us stupid and the deal means nothing and yesterday i think he just said that the united states is essentially nothing this is our  this is our great great partner but when you have somebody  if i was making this deal and if the other side was bragging about it the deal wasnt made im not making that deal im not making it im walking but we kept it going and we should have never ever started negotiating that deal until we had our hostages back ok  we should have walked we should have doubled up the sanctions and walked and they would have  and i say it before the plane reached new york city or washington you could just turn it around because theyll call you theyll say lets go take your hostages but when you think about it you probably read today and yesterday one of the hostages was waiting for a very long period of time now obama said that it had nothing to do with the hostages that he would not do that for kidnappers he would not do that for kidnapping ok no no think of that you have got to think about it he wouldnt do it  now it was the same day right same day we have to be exactly accurate because theyll catch us right same day the money came in and one of the hostages a good guy i saw him interview on television good guy hard time btu didnt he say he waited forever he waited and somebody said nope we are waiting for either something or a plane to come in and here obama stands up yesterday and for seven minutes is telling us one thing had nothing to do with the other just a lie you know at least be truthful  and were talking about the same day  million and we could have had something that would have been a much better deal and you know what im all in favor of deals when it gets to nuclear but we could have made it  we should have walked and we should have walked with  too we have said sorry we dont have the money cant pay we dont have the money we owe almost  trillion im sorry fellas we love you we think youre the greatest guys on earth but we cant give you the money we dont have it and they will get angry and they will be upset and two days later youll be back negotiating you just saved yourself  billion right hundred and   billion  so we have terrorists pouring into our country we have people coming in i dont know if you saw this in maine  and maine knows because maine is  i was up there yesterday  a great place a great governor great governor paul is doing a great job and i think the most important issue facing civilization right now is radical islamic terrorism and we have a president that refuses to use the term and we have crooked hillary who does not want to use it now shes being forced to use it by me did you notice she gave a speech she said i will use it she called it i think radical islam but she said i will use it i will just like the transpacific partnership she called it the gold standard it is a horror show its almost as bad or maybe its going to worse than nafta signed by her husband which cleaned out many of the states in our country cleaned them out from manufacturing moved to mexico and other places nafta a total disaster nafta signed by bill clinton he never suffered the ravages because he signed it then he got out and other people did suffer with it but we are going to renegotiate nafta and if they dont want to make a great deal for us so we get our jobs back at least a lot of them if we cant make a great deal  and she cant do that by the way if she wanted to number one her donors would not let her her special interests would never let her her lobbyists would never let her number three she could not do it anyway even if she wanted to but were going to renegotiate and did you hear her the other day after years of saying how wonderful it is even though you look at new england and you look at new york state and you look at pennsylvania and ohio if you look at a lot of other places one of the reasons i won indiana so big  well one of the reasons was the great bobby knight ok bobby knight in indiana  thats gold standard right as she said about tpp but one of the reasons i won was because carrier air conditioning was moving to mexico from indiana and they let go of  people and ive been talking about this and i know how to stop it and youve heard me before so easy to stop there have to be consequences when mexico takes our companies and not only mexico there have to be consequences when china devalues its currency so that our companies can no longer compete with china even though we make better product i have friends who are manufacturers we make better product they cant get their product into china no how  and when a few times arise where they can they have to pay an incredible tax beyond what anybody would even think costs but yet we open our doors and just throw away your stuff and we lose our jobs and it is very very said but look as many know a major destination  maine has become a major destination for somali refugees we admit hundreds of thousands of refugees into the united states from many of the most dangerous and unstable regions in the world and you are getting them here too folks you just dont know it because you just dont know anybody in this room  anybody in this room from a terror territory all right a practice  and this is a practice which will continue under hillary clinton except it will expand five six seven fold i dont get it i mean i know they will vote democrat ok thats what i know but they will not be voting for a long time i just  i dont get it how can anybody even think this way now the washington times reported of the somali refugees  the program in minnesota  that the effort to resettle large groups of somali refugees is having the unintended consequence of creating an enclave of immigrants with high unemployment that is both stressing the state safety net  tremendous problems for safety  and creating a rich pool of potential recruiting targets for the islamic terror groups arent we smart we are having this problem across our refugee and immigration programs here are some of the examples  i will give you a few examples and this came out of the senate subcommittee just recently the boston bombers  remember those horrible disgusting people the boston bombers arrived through the political asylum process the younger brother applied for citizenship and was naturalized on september   the older brother had a pending application for citizenship and look what happened we took them in look what happened arent we smart the moroccan national who came to the united states on a student visa was arrested for plotting to blow up a university in a federal courthouse great a uzbek refugee living in idaho was arrested and charged with providing support to a terrorist organization in the form of teaching terror recruits how to build massive and very dangerous bombs we let him in an immigrant from syria who later applied for and received us citizenship was accused by federal prosecutors of planning to go to a military base in texas and kill three or four american soldiers execution style if possible  more than that if at all possible a college student who immigrated from somalia who later applied and received us citizenship attempted to blow up a christmas tree lighting ceremony in oregon an immigrant from afghanistan who later applied for and received us citizenship and a legal permanent resident from the philippines were convicted for plotting to join al qaida and the taliban in order to kill as many americans as possible  as many as possible an iraqi immigrant who later applied for and received us citizenship was arrested for lying to federal agents about pledging allegiance to isis his travels to syria and how many americans he wanted to kill two immigrants from pakistan who later applied for and received us citizenship were sentenced to decades long prison sentences for plotting to detonate a bomb  and a very big bomb in the middle of new york city an immigrant from yemen who later applied for and received us citizenship was arrested for trying to join isis he was also charged with attempting to illegally buy firearms to try to shoot as many american military personnel as possible all right folks so i just say what are we doing what are we doing and hillary clinton wants more and more to pour in you can almost say you know politics aside whether you are a democrat whether you are a liberal a republican a conservative what are they doing i dont care who you are what the hell are they doing  so we are going to have strong borders our southern border is going to be very powerful we are going to stop the drugs from pouring into wisconsin and every place else  the heroin epidemic is beyond belief in new hampshire a great place that is where i realized the extent of what is going on i met with the people of new hampshire and they tell me the biggest problem they have is heroin i said it cant be with the beautiful lakes and streams it so beautiful right and their biggest problems heroin i said you have to be kidding that cant be right  and it was their youth is being poisoned and then you go to massachusetts and you go to north carolina and south carolina and you come here you come here  i just left iowa you go to iowa and you see the tremendous problems they have with heroin and drugs that pour in from the southern border and look heres the story we are going to have strong borders we are going to have a wall it will be a big and powerful wall  a big powerful wall  you know that hillary clinton wanted a wall a number of years ago she wanted a wall and the primary research as we understand it looking back not that long ago she wanted a wall you know walls do work folks all you have to do is ask israel all you have to do is ask some of the nations that are in europe right now that are building walls you know its sort of interesting obama talks about there will be no wall but in the white house which he just said which is true they want to build essentially a wall they want to build a fence a lot bigger and a lot higher and a lot stronger you know it is interesting i say dont build that fence right dont build that fence because they say walls dont work  fences dont work dont build that fence when hillary doesnt want to let you have your guns she is surrounded by people like this that have more firepower on them than any human beings on earth and i think she doesnt want to have guns i think that all of her bodyguards and all of her secret service should immediately give up their weapons  ok i mean it they should immediately give up their weapons they should immediately give up those weapons and if somebody comes at you with a gun you just try to talk them out of it i guess you got to do some quick talking you got to do some quick talking hillary i dont think even hillary with her phony lies and disgusting habits i dont think hillary could get away with that one  so we are going to have a little contrast and i did this very quickly but it is so simple hillary wants to raise taxes trump is going to lower taxes vary substantially the biggest tax decrease of all on business and personal hillary wants to significantly expand regulations trump is going to get rid of many many many regulations  which by the way are stopping your businesses both small and big from succeeding from expanding and more than anything from starting you cant start a business today the regulations are so onerous and horrible hillary wants to shut down energy production trump wants to expand it significantly and well start paying off our debt hillary wants to essentially abolish the second amendment take away your right donald trump will protect it more so than any president that has ever served  crooked hillary wants far left activities judges forced over there by bernie and by pocahontas  who will destroy our constitution i want judges who will support and defend our constitution  as close by the way to justice scalia who was great as we could get ok  hillary wants to open our borders just open them up because her special interests and donors want it that way there are reasons i understand that i want to totally secure our borders but i want people to come in but they come in through a process and they come in legally  hillary wants to invade foreign countries did you ever see where she said donald trump with the nuclear  im  i didnt want the war in iraq and im on record i didnt want the war in iraq i didnt want all of  what theyve done and i said if you read esquire magazine from a long time ago youll see everything i said was exactly right  its going to destabilize the middle east i said the meanest toughest group of people the people that hate the united states and its people the most theyre going to take it over thats exactly whats happened theyre taking over the oil theyre taking over the land theyre taking over everything i didnt want it but im always being accused like the war hog  they think im a tough guy the war hog  right they think she wants to be tough with russia so she said well donald trump likes putin i dont know putin folks i dont know i hope i like him i hope he likes me because id love to get along with russia ok  love to but i dont know but she goes donald trump donald trump  think about it  wants to befriend putin and other things she said right and im saying to myself whats wrong with that thats good but shes going to be the tough one see shes going to be the tough one shes going to play with nuclear weapons you know they have all the  shes going to be the tough one ill tell you what you put her in the office of the president  you know she hates putin and putin hates her right thats what i hear no no  putin probably doesnt respect her more than anything else but putin hates her but shes going to be tough were going to be tough with russia  oh were going to be tough right let me tell you were in a different world today folks were in a different world but she makes it sound like im this tough guy that will have a temperament you know she uses the word  you know who gave her the word her people that write the speeches well say trump with a temperament they said trump in a speech with tweets ive got  ive got between facebook and twitter like almost   million people its an asset its an asset i tweet well but  but she said  she made the statement during her speech you know i heard it barely because i was falling asleep you couldnt watch it  all right so remember that one hillary wants to invade foreign countries look at libya look at that we did a great job there you know a spot hit on gaddafi maybe but i mean even that what the hell do we get out of this its a disaster then you have benghazi then you have isis  then you have isis  then you have isis taking over the oil large portions of the oil and its some of the finest oil in the world and you have isis grabbing it we dont know what were doing we have people that dont know what were doing we have people that militarily  in fact they said well who is your military consultants and i give them names but theyre not working now you know theyre not working now and i said of course theyre not working now look what working now people have gotten us havoc who the hell wants the people who are working now i mean  you know a lot of its common sense and a lot of its instinct and she has very bad judgment shes got no instinct whatsoever and when i was asked on one of the big networks about nato they said what do you think of nato now you know its not like it was my primary subject in all fairness ive only been doing this for  months now its actually almost  months hard to believe right but nato  so i said i know enough and sometimes knowing a little is better than knowing too much you understand you cant see the forest through the trees right so i said nato in my opinion is obsolete because its not covering terrorism obsolete for that reason and also you have many countries that arent paying their fair share theyre not paying what theyre supposed to be paying and were protecting those guys  and were supposed to get into world war iii for all these countries that arent paying their fair share and even the commander of nato  and i so respect what he did he came out the other day and he said donald trump is right we have cut  did you see the letter  the big story donald trump is right im sure obama was thrilled when he saw that  donald trump is right you have countries that arent paying and he said how he goes in and he talks to them he says look youve got to pay your bills i have budgets  which is true and i have to go back to congress and i have to say whats happening they dont pay their bills though because people dont ask properly and they probably say to the president or whoever may handle the country sir we owe the united states millions of dollars were ready to pay oh have they asked for the money no theyll pay ok but i will say the commander of nato said i was right and then you have these people back here  stupid people  right here they said donald trump  theyre the worst theyre the worst they said donald trump  donald trump doesnt like nato he is going to abandon nato thats not what i said i said theyve got to pay theyve got to pay now you have to walk you may have to walk but theyve got to pay were going to get in world war iii for all these countries that are laughing at the stupidity of the united states right no theyve got to pay and they probably will in all fairness but hillary said about japan  because japan were defending japan you know that right now in all fairness before  put yourself back three years ago did anybody know that we defend japan raise your hand who knew all right theres about  percent not bad i think some of you are lying ok i think some of you are related to hillary rodham clinton i think some of you are lying but we defend japan and a man comes up general or something a few months ago i remember so vividly and he said at a news conference because they were embarrassed because i kept saying theyve got to pay their way and if they dont  if they dont you always have to be prepared to walk  you have to do that you know we dont want to do that i understand the reason itd be nice to have them  but you know this isnt again  years ago we owe  trillion were defending all these  we defend japan we defend germany we defend saudi arabia you think they have the money to pay  how about we have military bases that we rent  we pay rent to saudi arabia to protect them no no think of it think of it think of the stupidity think of the stupidity so this general comes up has a news conference a few months ago and he said mr trump doesnt understand that japan is paying  percent of the cost to defend them so a reporter goes up who i think is fair  and said to me mr trump wed like your comment they say that japan is paying  percent of the cost to defend and i said why arent they paying  percent the reporter said ok not a bad question now heres the problem with the hillary  hillary rotten clinton heres the problem  here is  thats why she changed her last  thats why she doesnt want to use the name anymore because everybody was saying that i dont know ive been saying it but look here is  here is why it doesnt work for hillary she saw that i said that we have to get reimbursed for our costs at least right japan economic behemoth germany  see how well theyre doing  economic behemoth saudi arabia nothing but money they were making  billion a day with their high oil prices now theyre making a fortune the same thing economic behemoth why are defending them and why arent we being fully reimbursed now if we do that your budget already is starting to look real good ok you know you have budgets so we losing our assurance  we have an  billion trade deficit folks we trade with companies we have a deficit with other countries think of it   billion a year trade deficit do we make the deals no with china  billion trade deficit and they cheat us because they devalue their currency all the time whenever it gets a little bit tough devalue devalue and our companies cant compete right so heres the thing so hillary says about japan how dare he not not stay with our allies how dare he not do that i will never abandon our allies ever ever ever now how do you negotiate when youre telling somebody will never going to leave we may have to leave look japan has problems because you have the maniac in north korea making missiles but i mean you know so well get it now south korea it is an economic behemoth you cant buy television that is not made in south korea except sony which is made in japan which has sort of lost its way whether it is lg or samsung i order thousands of television sets you cant buy them in the united states id love to show me one company one of the pundits said they do make them theres a company and he showed me its a little company what they do is all the parts come in for  from all over the world they put them together and they give you a television that doesnt work and nobody ever heard of it  and then i put it into a luxury hotel and everybody complains right so you cant say to people when youre negotiating  because were talking about tremendous billions and billions of dollars you cant say to people  you cant say to people when youre negotiating well never leave you think of this were going to never leave you we love you well never leave you could you pay more no were not going to pay anymore youre not going to leave us why should we pay more so theres a chance well have to leave and theres a chance that you know japan will have to take over this monster and figure it out were very far away its very expensive you know we have a treaty with japan and if the united states is attacked they dont have to do anything but is japan is attacked we have to go in there will our full force and might and who the hell knows whats going to happen right world war iii who knows whats going to happen but if were attacked they dont have to do anything you tell me who makes these deals its like sergeant bergdahl right so we trade a dirty rotten traitor where five or maybe even six people were killed when he deserted and we knew that they were killed and we knew that he was a traitor we trade for five of the greatest killers the greatest killers in the middle east the five people that they wanted the most that is our deal so we get a traitor and they get five people that are right now most of them already back on the battlefields trying to kill everybody including us no more folks that is called the five for one president thats  that is the same guy that made the deal for  million the other guys couldnt leave the airport the hostages and then all of a sudden they were  and then you watched him yesterday saying that can you believe it this had nothing to do with that ok just a coincidence no no just a coincidence  no you know she is unfit to serve as president for a lot of reasons he is unfit also he has done so bad he has been so incompetent we have doubled our debt during his  think of it over the years of our country  over the years of our country he gets in and in eight years by the time his term is up we will have doubled our national debt think of it so we have to win this election this is a very important election i do not need to do this folks believe me i could be elsewhere right now i love being with you but i could be elsewhere i could be  i might be in wisconsin just a different location ok but i felt i had to do it i want to give back i will get back give back im going to give back im going to give back  i want to give back because our country does not win anymore   our country does not win anymore and it is not going to win with crooked hillary clinton not going to win its not going to win she does not know how to win our country is not going to win with her were going to be worse than we are with obama i mean if you want four more years of what is going on isis all over the place isis expanding and by the way our policeman are great great people  and we are not going to allow our policeman to be shot down anymore anymore no more no more so november th you have a big election i promise you this if i win were going to start winning again we are going to win on trade were going to win with our military

first time maybe ever we are going to win on trade deals we are going to make the finest we are going to bring our jobs back were not going to make it easy for these companies to leave and fire everybody it going to be very very expensive when they do it believe me its going to be very very expensive theyre going to say you know what maybe well stay wisconsin ok maybe we will stay  no its going to be very very hard were going to have strong borders were going to have the wall mexico is going to pay for the wall  percent  percent  we are going to get rid of obamacare were going to get rid of common core were going to bring our education  local were going to have local education were going to appoint great supreme court justices  and folks were going to start winning again were going to win at every level were going to win so much youre going to get tired of winning im telling you youre going to be begging me mr president  you will send your great quarterback right he will come to the white house everybody respects him hell come to the white house and hell say mr president the people of wisconsin they cant stand winning so much  could you tone it down just a little bit i will say i just cant do that we are going to win more and more and more were going to win at every level but we are going to win we are going to make america great again were going to make america safe again thank you very much everybody thank you thank you"
45,"Trump","thank youeverybody thank you very much thank you such a crowd beautiful thank you very much thank you thank you please thank you for the invitation to speak to you today it is wonderful to be in detroit been here many times  we now begin a great national conversation about economic renewal for america it is a conversation about how to make america great again for everyone especially  and i say especially for those who have at the very least  the city of detroit is where our city begins detroit was once the economic envy of the world the people of detroit help to power america to its position of global dominance in the th century  thank you thank you very much when we were governed by the america first policy detroit was absolutely booming engineers builders laborers shippers and countless others went to work each day provided for their families and lived out  totally lived out the american dream but for many living in this city that dream has long ago vanished when we abandon the policy of america first we started rebuilding other countries instead of our own the skyscrapers went up in beijing and many other cities around the world while factories and neighborhoods crumbled right here in detroit our roads and bridges fell into disrepair yet we found the money to resettle millions of refugees at taxpayer expense today detroit has a per capita income of under  about half of the national average  percent of the citys resident live in poverty over  times the national average the unemployment rate is more than twice the national average half of all detroit residents do not work detroit tops the list of the most dangerous cities in terms of violent crime  thank you thank you thank you detroit tops the list of most dangerous cities in terms of violent crime these are silent victims whose stories are never told by hillary clinton but victims whose suffering is no less real or permanent in short the city of detroit is the living breathing example of my opponents failed economic agenda  every policy that has failed this city and so many others is a policy supported by hillary clinton she supports the high taxes and radical regulation that forced jobs out of your community and the crime policies have made you far far less safe and the immigration policies that have strained local budgets and the trade deals like nafta signed by her husband that have shipped your jobs to mexico and other countries and she supports the education policies that deny your students choice freedom and opportunity  she is the candidate of the past ours is the campaign of the future  this is a city controlled by democratic politicians at every level and unless we change policies we will not change results  percent  today i will outline my economic vision in the coming weeks we will be offering more detail on all of these policies and the ones we have already rolled out  thank you everybody this is what happens when you go from  people to close to  people i guess in the coming weeks we will be offering more detail on all of these policies and the ones we have already rolled out can be viewed on my campaign website our opposition on the other hand has long ago run out of ideas all hillary clinton has to offer is more of the same  more taxes more regulation more bureaucrats more restrictions on american energy and more restrictions on american production more of that if you are a foreign power looking to weaken america you could not do better than hillary clintons economic agenda  nothing would make a foreign adversaries happier than for our country to tax and regulate our companies and our jobs right out of existence the one common feature of every hillary clinton idea is it punishes you for working and doing business in the united states  every policy she has tilts the playing field for other countries at our expense and that is why she tries to distract us with tired political rhetoric that seeks to label us divide us and pull us apart my campaign is about reaching out to everyone as americans and returning to a government that puts the american people first  thank you thank you here is what an america first economic plan looks like first lets talk tax reform taxes are one of the biggest differences in this race  hillary clinton who has spent her career voting for tax increases plans another massive job killing   trillion tax increase big increase one of the biggest ever her plan would tax many small businesses by almost  percent recently at a campaign event hillary clinton short circulate  you know this youve heard this one  hillary clinton short circuited again to use a  now famous term  when she accidentally told the truth and said she wanted to raise taxes on the middle class  i am proposing an across the board income tax reduction especially for middle income americans this will lead to millions of new and really good paying jobs the rich will pay their fair share but no one will pay so much that it destroys jobs or undermines our ability as a nation to compete  as part of this reform we will eliminate the carried interest deduction thank you as part of this reform we will eliminate the carried interest deduction well known deduction and other special interest loop holes that have been so good for wall street investors and for people like me but unfair to american workers tax simplification will be a major feature of the plan  our current tax code is so burdensome and so complex that we waste nine billion hours a year in tax code alliance my plan will reduce the current number of brackets from seven to three and dramatically streamline the process  we will work with house republicans on this plan using the same brackets they have proposed  percent  percent and  percent for many american workers their tax rate will be zero well we will develop our own set of assumptions and policies agreeing in some areas but not in all or in others we will be focused on the same shared goals and guided by the same shared principles jobs growth and opportunity  these reforms will look for the biggest tax revolution since the reagan tax reform which unleashed years of continued economic growth and job creation we will make america grow again  the days ahead we will provide more details on this plan and how it will help you and most importantly your family it will present a night and day contrast to the job killing tax raising poverty inducing obamaclinton agenda  so important the state of new york has already lived through hillary clintons failed leadership the washington post just published today a devastating article on hillary clintons broken promises  she pledged  jobs for upstate new york when she was a senator but what happened  what happened the washington post writes and i quote upstate jobs growth stagnated overall during her tenure with manufacturing jobs plunging to recordsetting levels plunging nearly  percent the former first lady was totally unable to pass bigticket legislation many promised jobs they were all promised i remembered so well vote for jobs shell bring back your jobs many promised jobs never materialized and others migrated to other states she turned her first presidential run which also was a disaster  thank you thank you data shows that upstate actually lost jobs a lot of them during clintons first term in other words she was all talk no action upstate new york what a disaster its a disaster whats happened to upstate new york and nafta which her husband signed is a very very big reason compare that to my record in a recent new york post article by steve cuozzo how donald trump helped save new york city the paper writes that i and this is a direct quote in other words its not from me  thank you thank you all very well planned out every   and this is a direct quote that basically donald trump waded into a landscape of empty th avenue storefronts the dust ball  mugging ground that was central park  so dangerous  and a wall street area seemingly on its last legs as companies moved out then almost by sheer force of will he rode to the rescue expressing rare faith in the future he was instrumental in kickstarting the regeneration of neighborhoods and landmarks almost given up on for dead true i have to say i didnt say it they said it this is what i want to do you all remember new york city was a disaster we made it great we made it great this is what i want to do  thank you this is what i want to do for our country i want to jumpstart america and it can be done and it wont even be that hard  now lets look at what the obamaclinton policies have done nationally their policies produced  percent growth the weakest socalled recovery since the great depression  all over its a disaster and a doubling of the national debt during the obama years there are now  million americans outside of the labor force it was  million when president obama took office an increase of  million people the obamaclinton agenda taxed spent and regulated has created a silent nation of jobless americans home ownership is at its lowest rate in  years thank you very much thank you i will say the bernie sanders people had far more energy and spirit i will say nearly  million people have been added to the food stamp and these people are growing and growing so rapidly since president obama took office another nearly  million people great americans are right now living in poverty poverty ok poverty we have the lowest labor force participation rates in four decades  percent of the africanamerican youth are either outside of the labor force or not employed one in five american households do not have a single member in the labor force not a single member of a household these are the real unemployment numbers the  percent figure is one of the biggest hoaxes in american modern politics meanwhile american households are earning more than  think of that  less today than they were  years ago the average worker today pays  percent of their wages to income and payroll taxes on top of that state and local taxes consume another  percent very grim picture the united states also has the highest business tax rate among the major industrial industrialized nations of the world at  percent its almost  percent its almost  percent when you add in taxes at the state level and in many cases and many states its much higher than that in other words we punish companies for making products in america but let them ship products into the united states taxfree if they move overseas this ladies and gentlemen is backwards this is backwards all of our policies should be geared toward keeping jobs and wealth inside of the united states under my plan no american company will pay more than  percent of their business income in taxes in other words were reducing your taxes from  percent to  percent thank you thank you small businesses will benefit the most from this plan hillary clintons plan will require small business to pay as much as three times more in taxes than what im proposing and her onerous regulations will put them totally out of business and you wont be able to start you cannot ever start a small business under the tremendous regulatory burden that you have today in our country  im going to end it i am going to cut regulations massively massively our lower business tax will also end job killing corporate inversions and cause trillions in new dollars in wealth to come pouring into our country and by the way into cities like right here in detroit to help unleash this new job creation we will allow businesses to immediately expense new business investments no one will gain more from these proposals than low and middle income americans my plan will also reduce the cost of child care by allowing parents to fully deduct the average cost of child care spending from their taxes we are also going to bring back trillions of dollars from american businesses that are now parked overseas they cant bring their money back into our country our plan will bring that cash home applying only a  percent tax this money will be reinvested in states like michigan  states like michigan which are having serious problems finally no family will have to pay the death tax american workers have paid taxes their whole lives and they should not be taxed again at death its just plain wrong and most people agree with that we will repeal it  next comes regulatory reform as with taxes i will have one overriding goal when it comes to regulation i want jobs and i want wealth to stay in america motor vehicle manufacturing is one of the most heavily regulated industries in the country and even in the world the us economy today is  percent smaller than it would have been without the surge of regulations since  it is estimated that current overregulation is costing our economy as much as  trillion a year thats money taken straight out cities like detroit  so many of our cities are suffering so gravely right out of detroit and others the federal register is now over  pages long as the wall street journal noted president obama has issued close to  new major regulations since taking office each with a cost to the american economy of  million or more in  alone the obama administration unilaterally issued more than  new regulations each a hidden tax on american consumers and a massive lead weight on the american economy it is time to remove the anchor dragging us down and thats what its doing its dragging us down upon taking office i will issue a temporary moratorium on new agency regulations my running mate mike pence  and by the way a great guy  signed a similar order when it came and became and when he worked so hard in indiana as its governor  this will give our american companies the certainty they need to reinvest in our community get cash off of the sidelines start hiring new jobs and expanding their businesses so important thats what its about i will also immediately cancel all illegal and overreaching executive orders next i will ask each and every federal agency to prepare a list of all of the regulations they impose on americans which are not necessary do not improve public safety and which needlessly kill many many jobs those regulations will be eliminated quickly we are in a competition with the world and i want america to win we dont win anymore but when i am president we will start winning again big league one of the most important reforms of all is trade reform as bernie sanders has said hillary clinton has bad judgment he said it many times weve seen this bad judgment overseas in libya iraq and syria weve seen it in iran weve seen it from president obama when he gives  billion to iran  the number one terrorist state and even gives them  million in money laundered cash as a ransom payment but weve also seen the terrible obamaclinton judgment right here for everybody to see in detroit hillary clinton has supported the trade deals stripping this city and this country of its jobs and its wealth she supported bill clintons nafta she supported chinas entrance into the world trade organization she supported job killing trade deals and that was a really bad one with south korea and she supports the transpacific partnership not now but very soon if she wins and we cant let her win because that will be a disaster for detroit and everybody else  lets talk about south korea for a moment because its perfectly and it just perfectly illustrates the broken promises that have hurt so many american workers president obama and the usual socalled experts who have been wrong about every trade deal for decades predicted that the trade deal with south korea would increase our exports to south korea by more than  billion resulting in some  jobs like hillary clintons broken promises to new york these pledges all turned out to be false instead of creating  jobs it has killed nearly  jobs according to the economic policy institute our exports to south korea havent increased at all but their imports to us have surged more than  billion more than doubling our trade deficit with that country what else is new its happening with everyone the next betrayal will be the transpacific partnership hillary clintons closest friend terry mcauliffe confirmed what ive been saying and this is from the beginning if sent to the oval office hillary clinton will enact the tpp as sure as youre sitting there her donors will make sure a vote for hillary clinton is a vote for the tpp and its also a vote for nafta our annual trade deficit in goods with mexico has risen from close to zero think of that close to zero in  to almost  billion today our total trade deficit in goods hit nearly  billion last year total trade deficit almost  billion  this is a strike at the heart of michigan and our nation as a whole according to the bureau of labor statistics before nafta went into effect there were  auto workers in michigan today that number is only  auto workers detroit is still waiting for hillary clintons apology she has been a disaster obama has been a disaster i expect detroit will get that apology right around the same time hillary clinton turns over the  e mails she deleted  hillary clintons transpacific partnership will be an even bigger disaster for the auto industry believe me even bigger and even worse than nafta in fact ford motor company has announced its opposition to the deal according to the economic policy institute the us trade deficit  with the proposed tpp member  all of the member countries has cost over  million manufacturing jobs in the year   million jobs by far the biggest losses occur in motor vehicles and parts which lost nearly  manufacturing jobs what are we doing michigan ranks first for jobs lost as a share of state workforce due to the trade deficit with tpp members just imagine how many more auto mobile jobs will be lost if the tpp is actually approved it will be catastrophic thats why i have announced we will withdraw from the deal before that can ever ever ever happen  hillary clinton will never withdraw from tpp she is bought controlled and paid for by her donors and special interests  percent  because my only interest is the american people i have previously laid out a detailed sevenpoint plan for trade reform available on my website it includes strong protections against currency manipulation big problem  tariffs against any countries that cheat by unfairly subsidizing their goods and it includes a total renegotiation of nafta which is a disaster for our country a total renegotiation and if we dont get a better deal we will walk away  at the center of my plan is trade enforcement with china this alone could return millions of jobs into our country china is responsible for nearly half of our entire trade deficit they break the rules in every way imaginable including militarily china engages in a legal export sub cities prohibited currency manipulation and rampant theft of intellectual property its rampant its out of control they also have no real environmental or labor protections further undercutting american workers totally undercutting our workers just enforcing intellectual property rules alone could save millions and millions of american jobs  according to the us international trade commission improved protection of americas intellectual property in china would produce more than  million more jobs right here right now in the united states  add that to the same jobs from cracking down on currency cheating and product dumping  and we will bring trillions of dollars in new wealth and wages back to our country the united states of america thank you  so simple so simple trade has big benefits  thank you trade has big benefits and i am in favor totally in favor of trade but i want trade deals for our country that create more jobs and higher wages for american workers isolation is not an option thank you  thank you isolation is not an option only great and well crafted trade deals where we as a country for once benefit instead of being taken advantage  instead of being taken advantage of we are going to benefit and our workers are going to benefit or were not going to make those deals  also critical to our economic renewal will be energy reform the obamaclinton administration has blocked and destroyed millions of jobs through their antienergy regulations while raising the price of electricity for both families and businesses as a result of recent obama epa actions coalfired plants across michigan have either shut down entirely or undergone expensive conversions making them noncompetitive in many cases the obama clinton war on coal has cost michigan over  jobs hillary clinton says her plan will put a lot of coal companies and coal miners out of business we will put our coal miners and our steelworkers back to work where they want to

46,"Trump","well thank you very much and hes not yearsold hes actually  right but hes been mining for  years safely its fantastic  i thought he looked pretty good at  he looks really good at  ill tell you that so i want to thank everybody its fantastic to be here weve had a tremendous response from the miners and you look at west virginia what happened there during the primaries it was a massive landslide for trump and it was very interesting because after winning new york here we are standing on th avenue and i said  and the all  just incredible street of new york and for some reason and it had nothing to do with west virginia i just said it because i was seeing what was happening with this industry and i said in this you know really such a different location that we are going to put the miners back to work and i said that during my speech and  and by the way  and i meant it and then a number of weeks later i went to west virginia and we had a big huge building actually and it was packed and there were thousands and thousands of people  tends of thousands of people outside and youve never seen so many people it was like love like absolute love the way they showed up the miners and you know we did so well there it was something i wont forget i mean it was really incredible and i pulled over some of the folks because afterwards i was talking to some of the people and some of the mine owners who have been really decimated and really in many cases destroyed by regulation and by what theyre doing to the mines and you look at all the mines that have been closed up but i brought over some of the miners and we were talking after the speech and i said could i ask you like would you ever think of maybe leaving and going into a different industry going into a different job and they all said  and i understood this very well because you know my father was in real estate i went into real estate we sort of do that they said mr trump we love mining we dont want to do anything else we love mining i so understood that it was so incredible and they all said it like at the same time they want to be miners but their jobs have been taken away and were going to bring them back folks were going to bring them back  the  the us  i just took a look at this somebody just handed  the us has lost nearly  mining jobs since    and thats not a long period of time  jobs  the senator brought up a fact and a couple of the folks brought this up and its a fact that nobodys heard but during times of national problems were talking about the defense of our country having those minds and having that potential energy source available to us is an awfully important thing its an awfully important thing and nobody thinks in terms of that they dont think in terms of that  and i fully  and i fully understand that but its been an honor we just met with some of the folks were really representative i would say senator i would say representatives from every aspect of the business right and it was amazing it was really amazing these are great people theyre great americans they love this country and if i get in  if i get in i mean you know its  its  if i get in this is what it is ok  and  and other forms of energy all forms of energy but what theyve done to the minors is incredible and the obama administration and you remember and i think you mightve just seen it  yes know what theyve done and nobody knows you know clean call nobody knows while you look at whats happening with china the amount of energy theyre producing and what theyre using coal for tremendous amounts of  just tremendous its like incredible theyre not cleaning it believe me theyre not cleaning it we have a small a very very small planet compared to the universe right and that stuff is going up and theyre not cleaning it and here we produce great stuff and were not allowed to use it and its getting worse and worse so theyre gonna be out of business soon hillary clinton will be worse than obama you know it shell be worse  dont forget when she made the statement gonna put the minds and essentially gonna put the minds and minors out of business gonna put them out of business and i guess she forgot about west virginia right she was  she was going to west virginia she forgot about virginia too in all fairness you know  you know she had  she had west virginia right after  a short time after that and you remember when she went into west virginia she met with that wonderful family and the man  the  miner for many years and he was trying to explain to her and she was trying to say well you know i really wanna keep  she didnt know she was groveling she was groveling she didnt know what to say i dont think he was going to be easily convinced do we agree because she said it just like she said and you know she said it was a mistake that shes going to raise taxes in the middle class you saw that one now maybe she misspoke i mean we have to give them a break but it did come out awfully loud and clear i  i dont know hey look hopefully it wont matter ok hopefully its not gonna matter because shes not gonna get   but what i told  what i told the folks before we were over at peterbilt  the plant incredible but what i told  what i told the folks before is  is that you have to get our and vote because the minors to a certain extent they are so down and theyve been treated so badly that they havent been voting they havent been going out and voting like they can and that includes members of their family that have left the mining business let members of the family  theyve left coal theyve left everything and theyve gotten into something else and thats fine thats great  but they live in virginia and they vote and their parents are still in the coal world where they wanna be and thats where they wanna be but everybody has to get out and vote if you get out and vote were pretty close in virginia and shes spending a fortune in ads a friend of mine said he cant see television without seeing antitrump ads and theyre not even true my friend actually said theyre not true i said i know i could go over those ads one by one and show you the  its fraudulent actually but what are you going to do shes spending wall street money on ads and its just one after another after another and this guy kiddingly said i just want to see one ivory soap ad one just to break it and we havent spent anything yet we will be because were doing well but we havent spent anything yet were holding it but its really  its really a shame that they can say whatever they want to say they try and demean and defame and then you look at what shes doing with her emails  missing emails yeah  its  its very sad and then i guess yesterday  came out or something  some fairly vast number oh i want to see the ones  the  what i really would like to see the  we have to see the  can you imagine remember she said i think it was for her wedding  the wedding of chelsea and it was for yoga classes  emails its a lot of yoga  its a lot of yoga but a couple of very bad ones came out and it  its called pay for play and some of these were really really bad and illegal but its true its illegal youre paying and youre getting things i mean i watched yesterday because of the apprentice blagojevich right governor blagojevich   years in jail and you know some people think ok some people think its crazy look at what shes done  nothing shes running for president but it came out to her people pay for play and very big stories today the problem is itll be big stories for about two minutes and then theyre going to drop it because the media is so totally dishonest  so totally  if that were me  if that were me the story that just came out this morning  and really hidden from some of the major newspapers  hidden if that were me that would be biggest story in the history of the various papers they go quadruple spacing bomb  trump but with her its  its just  i mean it  its  i mean some of them covered it  big league but some of them are just refusing to really report the facts and i think its gonna get worse and worse though because i assume more stuff will come out but this was big stuff pay for play  its illegal i mean its illegal and well see what happens with it folks well see what happens with it but its very serious stuff its very very serious i dont know that it can be any more serious than deleting or getting rid of  emails and all of the other things  the server  the server which not allowed to have the information gotten off that servers by who knows who probably many people  many countries potentially secretary of state to put us all in that position so i think its a very sad thing  and they give her a pass on everything give her a pass its so sad when i watch that and it was point after point after point and everybody was saying wow theyre really going to do it and then they go however  as soon as i heard  you know when you hear the word however but its just  its just so incredible that a thing like that could happen so lets see what happens lets see what happens in the meantime were doing very well you saw the polls over the last day or two have really tightened up a lot i think were going to have a great victory i really feel it  one of  one of the things i suggested is your ballots you go and sign  do it early so you dont have to  because on november th we have our big day and if you go in an sign we have some people in the room now that ive met before that are going to be pushing hard but put in your ballots they have certain requirements and you live by those requirements perfectly make sure they dont lose your ballot make sure they dont lose your vote which im sure  you know and i just left a great place north carolina and they just had a tremendous loss  voter id voter id they lost voter id how do you lose voter id you mean you dont have to show identification you dont have to show that hey and then you say  you know ive been talking about the rigged system for a long time and i get hammered in the press for talking about it oh i cant believe hed be talking about the rigged system and then in the meantime voter id you dont have to do and im sure none of those folks would be voting  times during one day right im sure a thing like that  but i get  and really a big part of the rigged system is the press itself because they can take a little story that isnt a story and make it into a big deal it happens so much happens so much and speaking of that remember this we have so many things that we have to protect in this country we have to protect our second amendment which is under siege  remember that remember that its under siege  thank you thank you thank you we have to  you know i see  and by the way we have a lot of unity in the republican party but nobody talks about it if one senator says were not voting for trump never trump some people were beaten so badly that they you know they just cant get it and i understand that i mean i can see that could happen so you know theyve won throughout their lives politically and then they lose an election by a lot to a guy that never ran before ok i never ran before never thought id be doing it this time either but i watch whats going on and i say its time  its time boy is it time right  you know i look at the iran deal how about the  million in cash how about that how about that the  million  do you know what that is does anybody know what that would even look like   and did you see iran actually finally did do what i thought they were going to do they released pictures because they want to embarrass the united states just like they took the  sailors and they made us look so bad they made us look so bad it was like a humiliation of our country  ok this is horrible and then we keep going and going and you saw what their socalled leader  somebody would say the supreme leader i refuse to use that term president obama would say the supreme leader what is going on folks what is going on with our leaders and with our leader in particular he is grossly incompetent ok grossly incompetent  so  so their   million in cash going it happens to be the same day as the hostages were released the hostages were in the airport for massive amounts of time and i guess one of them said they wouldnt let us go because they were waiting for a certain plane to come in and i just cant imagine what was on that plane right we cant imagine im sure it had nothing to do with the  million but isnt that unbelievable and then hell stand up and hell say that one thing had nothing to do with the other and then practically i guess you could say theres a one or two percent chance that you know what he said is right but thats about it they would practically  theyre saying  theyre waiting for something else and a plane to come in right and they were at the airport forever and they say and president obama said no this had nothing to do with the hostages and you know if you remember with obamacare he said you can keep your plane you can keep your doctor you have your doctor you have your plan  how many times he said it  times or something and many democrats approve that disaster its a disaster were gonna repeal it and replace it   but many many democrats  many many democrats would not have  you know won by almost nothing the margin was almost nothing and a lot of democrats approved it they didnt want to approve it but you know with the doctor and the plan and over and over again a lot of pressure put on and its out of control premiums are going up at a rate that nobody has ever seen before you know in texas through blue cross blue shield they just had almost a  percent increase and they  the big increase is now going to come on november st and theyre trying to delay it till after the election because it is catastrophic it is going to be an increase like never before im hearing numbers that i dont even wanna say because the press will say oh thats terrible he exaggerated theres not gonna be an exaggeration its going to be election changing and we cant let those numbers be released on another date sometime after the election because it will show what a total disaster obamacare is so important so i just say to all of the politicians in the room and your great congressman who is a terrific guy  where is he by the way  oh congressman stand up stand up  vote for him hes out guy  stand up senator come on senator  now we have  we have great people here so right now theyre swimming uphill but with trump well be just sliding beautifully down itll be a whole different deal itll be a whole different deal and it can happen quickly it can happen  we discussed that we had a big meeting and we discussed it its gonna happen very quickly it doesnt need to go through congress and doesnt need to go through lots of different things epa is very important what theyve done and we want  everybody agrees we want clean air and we want clean water do we agree i want  so i very much appreciate the meeting it was a great meeting i just wanna say that virginia has lost one in three manufacturing jobs since nafta now nafta was signed by bill clinton nafta is a disaster  its been a disaster not only for virginia but for virtually every state upstate new york it looks like a war zone thats why i won so much and i go the upstate vote in numbers that nobodys seen before upstate new york you go to new england you see the factories these beautiful old factories that you see they were once thriving thousands and thousands of people working and those people now are doing part time jobs theyre working two jobs theyre making less money than they made  years ago i dont know if you saw that statistic where people and people in this room too but where people are making less money now in real wages than they made  years ago and even longer and theyve gotten older gotten older and theyre working harder not supposed to be that its supposed  hey of course ive gotten older and im working harder too to be honest with you  i didnt need this i could have enjoyed myself a lot  oh getting older were working  its supposed to be the other way right were getting older and starting to relax no its not work i dont know i dont know that like that  i love what im doing i have been all over this country we have the greatest people anywhere in the world the greatest people  and i have the greatest supporters we have the most loyal supporters and the smartest you know they always like demean everything they try to demean supporters theyre always trying to put a little knock you know little shots boom boom boom weve got the smartest weve got the most loyal weve got the hardest working we have the best people they like to demean  but we have amazing just amazing people and ive seen this all over the country and we can start making apple computers in our country ok folks we can start building we can start building  you know we go to china and youd think even the shipping costs when you just think of it the shipping costs i mean how much of a difference we can  and you bid it all to different states and youll get the good deal from somebody just keep it in our country when they close plants and they move to mexico and then a company builds in mexico whatever product theyre making and then they think theyre going to sell the product back into the united states all of their people have been fired every single one of them have been fired and theyre now using people from another nation to make the same product and you know what they think theyre going to sell it across our border which by the way will become a very powerful very strong border ok its no long going to be a piece of swiss cheese  and they think theyre going to sell it across the border no tax no nothing sell it to wherever it came from let the people that got laid off buy it and now maybe theyre unemployed maybe theyre two jobs and theyre making less right as we said and not going to happen folks and ive watched for years as our government which is i guess you could say stupid but honestly not so stupid theyre controlled by special interests when you see companies moving over to mexico and other places  theyre controlled by special interests theyre controlled by lobbyists theyre controlled their donors who have big chunks of companies or own the whole company because these arent stupid people our politicians some are but we have a genius right over here thats all i care some are but a lot of them are just controlled because thats the way the system works so you think that you know like a friend of mine asked me a few weeks how did a deal like this get approved its impossible unless  you know theres no way theres a certain deal that happened with the government and he said how is it possible and hes a little naive and i said well its possible because that company has total control over the politicians that have to approve  now i spent like over  million substantially over  million in the primaries my own money i spent a lot of money now in the general election and im spending a lot of money for myself were also raising a lot of money were also getting a lot of money dont worry you dont have to give dont give were going to straighten this place out ok were going to straighten this place out but you know we have a lot of small donors   i think average we raised millions of dollars in june we raised actually  million of which like  million was small donors   million  and last month we raised  million of which much of it was small  i love the small donations  to me the best and so im spending a lot of money from myself im raising a lot of money for the republican party but the beautiful thing is the people that are giving those small dollar donations   average  because those people are invested in the campaign they want to see  they get out and vote  percent they get out there and they vote and its so important and a republican generally doesnt have that you know who had it bernie sanders had it he raised a lot of money with that and we have a different side of the ledger but we have the same thing i mean we have a tremendous amount people are shocked in fact newspapers that truly hate me put it on the front page they couldnt believe that they actually were very nice about it because you know the month before we raised nothing i wanted to make sure i got the nomination if you dont mind ok you know i wasnt going to go wild but once we started we started in june and in june i think we did  million and then we did  million and now we have very good numbers coming in again so were  were equipped we have to get the people out we have to get them out to vote but were equipped were going to do a job for you folks and youre going to be really happy in virginia ok  and im not only talking by the way im not only talking about the miners im talking about the whole state because look virginia has lost one in three manufacturing jobs right since nafta signed by bill clinton a disaster didnt hurt him it hurt every other president thats where the country emptied out without an agreement even aside  the existing us trade deficit with tpp tpp  its a disaster transpacific partnership is a disaster it will be as bad if thats possible i think nafta is the worst economic development deal ever signed by any country anywhere in the world thats how bad it is  and you know i said and its part of my platform i made a speech the other day some of you saw it i said were going to renegotiate nafta and they said well supposedly they dont renegotiate i said thats ok then were going out were out of it because its sucking our jobs out of the country i tell this story because its such a perfect story i could go out and hire a consulting firm pay them a million dollars and theyll spend months you know telling me whats going on with here and mexico and the different places right but i have much better i have a friend who builds plants i say how are you doing he said unbelievable i said great its going well inn the united states hes a us guy he loves this country he said no donald its going unbelievable in mexico he said were building some of the greatest plants in the world he said  he called it the eighth wonder of the world he said mexico is the eighth wonder of the world i said how about here he said not so good not so good can you believe this hes an american guys he wants to build here but just through years and years  i think hes the biggest in the world with plants or just one of them but he builds plants and hes really  he cant believe whats going on in mexico now thats better than hiring the consulting firm and saying tell me how were doing against mexico i mean i know the answer because he can give me the answer better than any guy that graduated from the wharton school of finance that youre paying a lot of money and hell go around and do surveys right  its common sense and it costs me nothing right but thats whats happening thats whats happening so not only is it the miners its  you know you look at manufacturing jobs are gone but naftas one of the worst deals ever signed by our country certainly the worst in terms of economic development what its done to us the destruction of manufacturing in virginia was caused by bill clintons signing of nafta and then shell come along and she had a very interesting thing because two days ago in the washington post  i was shocked in fact i had to read the story twice to believe it they did a story on  a big story she was a senator form new york and she made tremendous  you know tremendous promises of what she was going to do for new york when she became senator and she won the race and she was a disaster we lost jobs tremendous numbers of jobs she said shes going to help rebuild upstate new york and all these places where all these jobs were taken because of nafta and bills that her husband signed the whole thing but she said she was going to do a great job and it was a disaster she was going to create i think it was  jobs  jobs it was negative it went to hell its all talk its all talk  and now shes doing the same thing shes going to make a job speech or something tomorrow a speech on the economy look at what she did during her term as senator take a look at what happened during her first term take a look at what happened take a look at the results what she said  of all newspapers it was the washington post that did it it was like the most devastating article in fact i think im going to use it on my stump speech because you cant  it just doesnt get any worse she promised the world and it went  went like this it went down and she got virtually no legislation passed she couldnt get anything passed it was unbelievable at the same time or similar time a little while ago they had an article about donald trump and what i did for new york and manhattan and the buildings and the revitalization and all of that i mean they gave me a lot of credit for getting it all started and doing great jobs and i dont want to brag about it but im contrasting that  and thats what we have to do for our country we have to renegotiate our trade deals we have to bring trade back we have to bring jobs back to this country we have to bring jobs back to our country were losing our jobs i mean frankly  frankly any form of energy  and were losing our factories and were losing our jobs and were losing millions of jobs and were losing thousands and thousands of companies and theyre leaving and theyre going to other places i mean in particular in terms of manufacturing theyre going into mexico look at whats happening with michigan where ford and others are building these massive car plants in mexico folks theyre going to build cars and under clinton theyre going to just build them there and let them come roaring in and all those jobs  thousands of jobs over  jobs gone in michigan  car jobs all car jobs and  and im going in front of michigan i think we have a good chance of winning michigan i think because ive been talking about this for years  and hillary wouldnt know what to do so i just ask people when she makes her speech tomorrow or whenever shes doing it shell stand at the teleprompter shell spin around a couple of times always a very short speech then she gets off the stage she goes back home she goes to sleep  when shes  when she makes her speech tomorrow  very limited time did you ever notice very limited everythings very limited no  no effort no time great effort but doesnt spend any time shell make a speech and youll see her a little while later i mean take a look during the primaries take a look at the whole thing when she goes out and she makes her speech on economic development or on trade or on the economy or whatever shes going to be talking about refer yourself to yesterday take a look at the washington post take a look at the promises she made as a senator from new york and the jobs she was going to create take a look at what happened it is a wasteland whats happened up there our jobs got sucked away from us our factories are falling down just from the rain and the wind the ice the snow theyre falling down these plants are falling down and you could envision   years ago  years ago vibrancy and now take a look but you have to read this story and i think the biggest shock  if i read the story anywhere else because i know the story i mean i now she did nothing she had three minor bills passed one was the naming of a building and very little stuff she did nothing but if this were in any other paper it probably wouldnt have made such a big impact but this in the washington post one of the most dishonest papers in the world in terms of me  what they say  you know  the new york times actually did a story and this is sort of amazing they actually said in way that theyre biased toward me they actually said it they said we hate him so much essentially they say we hate him so much were going to be biased and most people have never seen a story like that even i was surprised you know normally youd think they wouldnt want to admit it they practically admitted it but you look at it but look at the washington post from two days ago look at the story on hillary clinton compare that with what she says tomorrow were never going to let her escape it because everything she says is all talk no action its all talk its no action  and the funny thing is that she put in a pretty unpopular guy right a pretty unpopular guy so you have bernie sanders who had big  almost  percent of the vote and the whole thing was rigged  the super delegates and everything else but regardless but he did a good job the nice thing about bernies people is that they agree with me on one thing  trade because he was so against what was going  these bad trade deals he just bought a  house so he knows something about whats going on you know hes got some sense right but  but about trade were in agreement now the difference is i can do something about it he would not be able to hed end it i want to have trade with other countries but i want to make great deals for our country i want to make great deals for our country  but she  she took a person  did you see how angry he was at the convention he was so angry because he made a deal and he made a deal that he wished in my opinion he wished he didnt make because his legacy would have been amazing if he didnt make a deal it would have been a lot different and on top of everything else instead of appointing someone that is a little bit like at least representative of that big faction of the party   percent instead of doing that she appoints tim kaine ok tim kaine  you cant get more different during tim kaines tenure as governor of virginia from   and you all remember right  it was a disaster  to  the unemployment rate of virginia more than doubled other than that hes doing great  now compare that with mike pence of indiana he did incredible hes also incredible  hes doing great and the states going great  aaa bond rating  doing great and ill tell you what mike pence really has been fantastic during tim kaines tenure as governor the state of virginia lost  manufacturing jobs during tim kaines tenure as governor of virginia it averaged only  percent in real gdp growth less than a week after tim kaine became governor of virginia he proposed a nearly  billion tax increase including a tax increase on people earning as little as  a year so everybody felt the brunt  and i could go on and on its  i could just go on and on talking about his transportation disasters everything else and i watched him the other day and he was saying  you know hes won elections but theyve always been very close he said every election i win is very close thats not a good thing right in other words they were so razor thin and then i said let me check and i called up some friends and i  you know when they first picked him i said oh by thats going to be tough because were doing  weve got to win virginia i want to win virginia  and  and what happened is  so during  during this period of time im saying  call up a friend a friend calls me three of four people call me i have a lot of property in virginia you know in charlottesville we have the property on the potomac river  potomac falls sterling loudon county we love loudon county we have a lot of stuff we employ a lot of people in virginia its a great place great  i dont know if you know my charlottesville place but its a fantastic place its now a winery its one of the largest wineries on the east coast we have a lot of employees there theyre going great  virginia wine which has become a very big thing and  so i have a big  i have a big stake in virginia we have a lot of  a lot of different property in virginia these two places are incredible theyre incredible places but i figured she was going to pick somebody that was unbelievable so i heard she picked somebody from virginia an ex governor i said oh man thats going to be tough weve got to beat somebody  he raised your taxes by  billion in his first week  he had negative growth i mean think of it he raised your taxes by  billion it was like a catastrophic governorship and i dont get it i dont get it and everybody said to me yeah he wasnt very popular and then i heard him talking how hes won races and every time he prides himself on having just won so i actually think hes going to be a negative in virginia not a positive i really do  i really do but you know what i wish him luck i wish him luck whatever whatever but look heres the story folks we have an election which is i think going to be the most  and i know they say this  everybody says it every four years i thought it actually four years ago but this is going to be  i think its our last shot i know this it is the last shot for the miners it is the last for the miners that i know that i know  and im not like a neutral for the miners im not like oh well hell be all right hillary will be a horror show and im going to be an unbelievable positive but this is the last shot every  the mines will be gone the mines will be gone if she gets elected   i believe  i honestly believe shell be worse than obama and i honestly  i know that when she made the statement not so long ago about the miners and the mines are going to be gone that was a statement that she believes that was the real truth that was  it wasnt sitting down talking to the guy whos such a good guy ive seen him on other programs and really a good representative in so many ways but thats  thats the real hillary and thats what shes going to do and shell probably come in and shell probably come down and see you and shell say oh well i actually think  shes  believe me folks thats where she is i hope you understand that these politicians can say anything they want and get away with it its really disgusting ok its really disgusting  so were going to open up were going to do such a good job and you know i understand you know i grew up  my father was a real estate  i grew up with the carpenters i grew up with the sheetrockers i grew up with the plumbers and the policemen and the firemen and the whole thing thats what i grew up with  people say gee whiz youre a rich guy but you get along very well with a lot of carpenters and a lot of electricians i said yeah thats what i did you know i mean thats what i did and these are amazing people the miners are amazing people so  so i  i really  and i say it its up to you youve got to get out and vote you just dont vote you know i dont know why and i think its because youve been beaten so badly as an industry just beaten up so badly i was talking about it with your congressmen just beaten up so badly that you just dont want to do it and i can understand youve got to do it weve got to give it one shot you know takes you  minutes or two minutes or  minutes  you have nothing to lose you have absolutely nothing to lose believe me you will be happy you will be happy you will be absolutely happy so just a couple of other things immigration weve got to have strong borders or we dont have a country  got to have strong borders  we are going to have a strong border we are going to have a strong southern border we are taking in drugs and youre having the problem here big league  up in new hampshire where i won the primary i got to know the people so well and their number one problem they told me is heroin i said heroin just doesnt go with the territory these beautiful trees and lakes and rivers and so beautiful heroin and it is their number one problem and now so many people their youth is so addicted and weve got to take care of that weve got to stop it from coming in comes in from the southern border and i got the  you probably heard the border patrol agents  border patrol agents endorsed donald trump and theyve never done it before for a president  theyve never done it before in a presidential   sheriff joe arpaio of arizona great guy he endorsed donald trump  he probably knows borders better than anybody in the history of the world right sheriff joe hes a great guy too but he endorsed us and weve got to have borders weve got to stop the drugs from coming in weve got to stop illegal immigration you know illegal immigrants  and we will build a wall dont worry about it were going to build a wall going to have to going to have to  were going to build a wall and mexicos going to pay for the wall theyre going to pay for it  just so you understand  look some of these politicians would get off stage with me and theyd say you know that you cant build a wall i said really china just built  years ago  china built a wall  years ago  miles we have  miles of which we really need  miles because you have a lot of natural barriers  lot of natural barriers so you need a  but we have   years ago a wall was built the great wall of china this is a serious wall ok this is a very serious wall and we have to build  and we have caterpillar tractors we have caterpillar tractors  not komatsu we have caterpillar we dont   no no we have caterpillar were going to start  remember the old days made in the usa right remember they used to have made in the usa we dont have it anymore  were going to have signs just like you know they made these signs i love them too but were going to have signs  look how beautiful on both sides see we cover them both you like yellow you like black yellow black  beautiful we cover a lot of territory right  what a good looking group of people   theyll be so happy in a year from now theyll be so happy its going to go fast  but i will say that  so we have to build the wall and were going to build the wall but you know the politicians would tell me you cant build a wall really can you build a wall they dont know i mean i built story buildings building buildings is tough building a wall boy is that easy precast  pschoom  and every time they fight me it gets  feet taller right every single time it gets  feet taller it goes up it goes up up up the taller it gets the safer it gets  no were going to have a wall and were going to let people come into our country because we want people to come into our country but theyre going to come into our country legally  legally  and then i said mexicos going to pay for the wall now we have a trade deficit with mexico of like close to  billion a year think of it mexico theyre making a fortune so these politicians say  because its not their deal its not their deal these politicians say well ok maybe you can build it but how are you going to get mexico to pay when you are losing so much money on trade like we lose to mexico its easy the wall is peanuts compared to the kind of numbers were talking about where theyre taking our jobs and building factories so easy but they dont know that they dont know because they dont have that instinct its not that theyre bad people although in many cases again theyre controlled by people that dont want to see the wall there are a lot of people that dont want to see that wall built and those are people that have reason to not want the wall built and in many cases again theyre representing their special interest groups their lobbyists their donors are representing companies where its not to the advantage to have the wall built but were going to build the wall were going to stop drugs from coming in were going to stop all of this illegal immigration and i see a lot of military guys in the room we have illegal immigrants treated better than our vets in many cases  and thats going to stop  we have vets that are treated so badly the veterans administration is a disaster were going to take care of our vets our military is depleted its depleted were going to build up our military were using fighters that are  years old where they cant even get parts they have to go to airplane graveyards to get parts for our fighter jets two went down last week you saw that so were going to make a lot of changes folks going to make a lot of changes so we have just to sum up obamacare out  repeal and replace very important common core  we want education local were getting rid of common core  were getting rid of common core and its obviously not working look at whats happening with our education look at where were ranked worldwide its not working folks we dont need bureaucrats in washington telling us how to educate our children in virginia ok  so we dont need it bureaucrats that make a lot of money by the way were going to have strong borders were going to make great great trade deals were going to bring jobs back were going to make money were going to make money for our country we need money were losing a fortune were losing almost  billion think of it  billion a year trade deficits worldwide  billion its going to end folks its going to end were going to have great relationships with these countries and were going to trade with these countries but its going to be a two way street not a oneway street right now its a oneway street  its a oneway street to unemployment theyre stripping us theyre stripping us of our jobs theyre stripping us of our money theyre taking our manufacturing  i mean every time i come to a location i have statisticians and they give me these numbers i dont even need the statisticians no matter where i go i mean manufacturing way down always way down not going up it goes down keeps going to down theyre moving to other places theyre moving to other countries theyre moving a lot to mexico its not going to happen anymore folks were going to keep our companies and if they want to move thats ok but there is going to be retribution its going to be  there are going to be consequences  going to be consequences  they want to sell product into our country theyre going to fire all our people they want to sell product into our country theyre going to have to  sadly theyre going to have to pay you know i use the case of carrier every single air conditioning unit they make in mexico theyre going to pay a  percent tax and you know you know whats going to happen  now a lot of people dont like to hear that a lot of the conservatives  you know the conservatives you know whats amazing to me when i say im going to renegotiate nafta and make it into a good deal from a disastrous deal  now you always have to be prepared to walk so theres a good chance well have to walk but im going to make it into a good deal as opposed to a bad deal i get bad stories  they said thats terrible hes going to  im like why whats terrible i want to make it a good deal when i say i want to get the nato countries to pay up  theyre not paying right theyre not paying many of them theyre not paying what theyre supposed to be paying  so what i have  were supposed to protect these countries theyre taking advantage of the united states and i think natos a good thing but theyre taking advantage of the united states theyre not paying what theyre supposed to be paying maybe theyre not being asked properly but theyre not paying so we protect countries that arent paying theyve got to pay up and you know what they  the money if you add it all up you know the kind of numbers were talking about in this country i mean we go from a country thats really bust to a country that can just be incredible  incredible and then ill get people saying i dont like nato i think natos wonderful it was obsolete i said ti was obsolete because it wasnt covering terrorism properly and they all laughed and they smiled they said donald trump said its obsolete well im not a great expert on nato but i have a lot of common sense said it was obsolete and i also said countries arent paying up those two things but it was obsolete because it wasnt covering terrorism and then about four months ago there was a front page story in the wall street journal got a lot of publicity they smiled and you know said trump said its obsolete about terrorism this and that a lot of them left the terrorism part out then about three months ago front page here in the wall street journal nato to develop terrorism unit wow i said thank you thats good  they gave me a tiny little mention like about a quarter of a sentence donald trump was unhappy but they gave me like a quarter of a sentence thats ok big progress right big progress so we all know what were doing so heres the story were going to start winning again as a country we dont win anymore were going to take care of our vets were going to build up our military were going to do a lot of great things  weve got to fix our infrastructure were going to fix our infrastructure so those peterbilts arent going to be running over potholes and having lots of problems right you know what im talking about a friend of mine in the trucking business said the roads have never ever been so bad you know that right that the roads have never ever been so bad he buys beautiful new equipment and he said what these drivers go through with the potholes and the problems and the bad roads he said its never been like this we have to rebuild our infrastructure we have to fix our bridges our tunnels our highways our roads our hospitals our schools we have so much to do weve spent  weve spent in the middle east  it used to be  thank you  it used to be  ive been saying for years   trillion in iraq iraq we shouldnt have been in iraq i said dont go to iraq youre going to destabilize the middle east thats exactly what happened and a lot of other things happened hillary clintons policies have been a disaster from the time she got  look at libya what did we get out of libya i mean thats been a disaster you look at what shes done you look at the bad decisions that shes made you look at the bad judgment like bernie sanders said shes got bad judgment you look at the bad judgment and now were going to put her in charge of our country we wont have a country left  so i just ask the people of virginia and the people in this room and in particular because were in such a mining area give it one more chance i know youre discouraged give it one more chance if youre not feeling good if youre so sick you cant move if your wife got angry at you and you dont want to get out of the house say im sorry  im just sorry charlotte im going out to vote for trump  you have to vote give it  seriously  give it one more chance go out and sign those early ballots go

different ways were going to make america great again were going to make america first and were going to make america safe again thank you thank you everybody thank you everybody  thank you thank you

substantially were going to be simplifying the whole deal you wont need hampr block anymore believe me youre not going to need them  middleincome people the taxes are coming way down theyre coming way

little bit bad because were talking about voter id all over the country theyre approving in some cases in some cases theyre not and you know i went to school in philadelphia i went to the wharton school of finance in philadelphia so i know the state very well my kids went to school here two of them and we love  we love the state but we have to be very very careful about our day because were going to have tremendous voter turnout were going to have unbelievable turnout but we dont want to see people voting five times folks we dont want to see it and ive heard some stories about certain parts of the state and we have to be very careful i dont even know maybe you should go down and volunteer or do something but without voter id theres no way youre going to be able to check it properly we have a lot of law enforcement people working that day were hiring a lot of people were putting a lot of law enforcement and by the way speaking of law enforcement do we love our police right we love our police  just met your chief hes like central casting you can put him in a movie right now but we love our police and i will tell you that i just  and i cant say it any more strongly were going to bring your jobs back were going to bring so much back were going to make our country great again were going to make america great again but  but its a tough process because you know ive been talking about a rigged system for a long time and ill tell you whatever you can do i know youre going to go out i know this part of pennsylvania is phenomenal i just left erie county erie has been i dont know i guess youve heard and bill has heard and everybody has heard what went on there we had   at least  people  and theyre going to go out and vote and youre going to go out and vote were going to have  i guess they call it the big t maybe thats lucky have you heard about the t they say that t is good i wonder what that means but i really  i really say look november th such a big day you have to turn out were bringing your jobs back were going to renegotiate trade deals nafta signed by bill clinton is a disaster its a disaster i watched hillary clinton yesterday she gave her short little speech reading a teleprompter on taxes are going to be raised can you believe it shes got a massive  trillion massive increase in taxes massive increase in regulation now speaking of regulation  before i speak of regulation reince i want to thank you where is reince what a great guy reince get over here right what a  he has done  thank you very much reince has done such an amazing job and they portrayed him slightly inaccurately reince come here for a second please  the head of the republican national committee has done such a great job were friends we work together we work with a lot of other people and i have to say we have great unification now every once in a while you read about somebody that wants to be a rebel they get a little free publicity for themselves but the way we have gotten along and ive raised  ive put in a lot of money into the republican national committee ive spent a lot of time and put in a lot of money and i will tell you  and im spending money on my own campaign you know i went through the whole primary system i paid for it and im going through this and im spending for me but were raising a lot of money for the republicans and honestly i just want to thank this man because it is not an easy job he has done an incredible job  thank you man thank you reince i appreciate it they like to portray it a little bit differently in the press these guys are the most dishonest people the most  and ill let you know  hey you know what we have a great relationship we have just about from the beginning when i first came out im not sure reince believed too much so you know i understand but if i didnt have a good relationship guess what you and they would be the first to know and i would call and i would tell them and i would tell you but weve had a special relationship but somebody has to call us so they write stories like for instance they wrote the story about the founder right barack obama the founder oh thats sort of nice do we like it turn him off we like him better the other way what was that they didnt pay their electric bill i guess right  but you know you talk about  barack obama has done such a poor job with isis that i have been for numerous days sarcastically saying that he is the founder of isis right youve heard that and then i say they really like him a lot dont forget when he took over i think there was  there were eight countries seven countries now i understand theyre in  countries theyre rampant all over the world probably theyre rampant here too because were taking in so many people we have no idea who they are so i say  so ive been saying and ill keep saying because its true but somewhat sarcastically ive been saying hes the founder of isis and i say shes a close second and then i say  but they cut it off in  media the dishonest media they cut that off because that you know shows a little sarcasm and i say theyre going to give hillary clinton the most improved player for letting isis exist look if it werent for them you probably wouldnt even have isis of course he calls it isil isil you know  and there are reasons to call it isil there actually are geographically there are reasons to call it isil but hes the only one and i honestly believe he calls it isil to make people angry because he is the great divider and let me tell you folks he is a terrible terrible president he has done a terrible terrible job he is grossly incompetent and we have to make a change and hillary clinton is four more years of obama  thats what she is four more years of isis four more years of high taxes think of it wants to raise your taxes and i dont think youre going to put up with it four more years of  well i guess there wont be any email scandal by that time can you imagine thirtythree thousand emails wiped out think of it  emails wiped out its a very sad thing folks well were going to get back to it listen so i just went and i visited one of your companies a great company an amazing family six generations really seven because i actually met the seventh generation you know what that is you know how long andrew jackson was president andrew jackson  and you probably  most of you know  thats right you know mike everyone knows mike so mike mclanahan an amazing guy i met his son i met his kids his grandkids i met everybody i met his employees and theyre devastated because after all of these years from  to now theyre really having a hard time because of obama and his ridiculous policies and george sidney works with mike and the family and they said things to me that i thought were incredible and i said i know you dont do this for a living and you probably have never done this before but if you could come up on the stage we have a small group of about  people if you could come up  and lots of television look at all those people oh theyre so terrible they are so dishonest   for instance  for instance  so as you know right downstairs and next door we have a room like this with just about as many people theyre not going to cover that theyre not going to show these massive crowds theyre not going to say that in the history of this building which i guess is  years old this is the biggest crowd theyve ever had by far by far theyre not going to say that theyre not going to say that  so  i would like to have george and mike just come up for a minute and explain the company quickly how it started where they are right now and what regulations and horrible horrible policy has done to these great people ok come on up thank you     so congressman shuster we just created two stars and you know it was so amazing though i looked and i love that stuff i love plants i love all of it and i looked at the plant and you can see its amazing the age but the cleanliness the loving care thats given to the plant ive seen plants that arent so good the care and the  i looked at a piece of steel as big a piece of steel  ive seen big steel but as big a piece of steel beam as ive ever seen and i was talking to him about it how do you get this in how do you truck it in what do you do do you splice it what are you doing and it was just fascinating but i saw that you know so many years so many years and i said so hows business they said its catastrophic its a disaster cant go on much longer and i said whats the problem is it regulation well its really tax and regulation but ive found over the years because ive met so many people same position incredible people the difference here is  thats a long time thats one thats really out there andrew jackson was president you know usually youll hear like ronald reagan was president that was a long time ago but andrew jackson so that was a long time ago but when i see the love in that plant and i met all the employees and one of them was there  years one of them there  years and  years great people and you know its just a question of time much smaller than it used to be the dollar is killing them killing them its not so much the dollar its that other countries are absolutely  you know what theyre doing well its china and it is china but its others and the devaluation of their currencies the devaluation of their currencies is absolutely killing our companies killing them and we let these people get away with murder and were the piggy bank remember they come in they dump their product next is going to be steel you watch first of all theyre killing your coal theyre totally killing your coal and thats one of mikes problems also because the stuff they make for coal i mean they dont need it anymore because the mines are all being closed and the miners dont have jobs and they want to have jobs you know i was in west virginia where i had a tremendous victory i got a massive vote and hillary clinton a few weeks before that she didnt know people were listening and she said were going to put the mines and the miners out of business all right  and then do you remember she went to west virginia and she sat around the round table with that beautiful miner and his family  that beautiful miner and his family and in very very sad terms he was explaining how they want to be miners right and she was trying to say she was only kidding essentially she was trying to  yeah she was lying hey look look has anybody lied as much as hillary clinton has anybody you look at the fbi director and you see what went on with the emails you see how she got away with that i think that that will go down in her career as her single greatest achievement how she got out of that mess but shes not out of it yet lets see what happens lets see what happens honestly its disgraceful and you know whos more disgraceful in my opinion the media because  because they dont put her  they dont put her to the task they dont put her to the task they dont do anything they follow me and im on all the time i do get much better ratings than her in all fairness though  but the media concept is that dont put her on because if you dont watch her shell be ok right right and then she goes out and she talks that she shortcircuited shortcircuited  the mind shortcircuited she was asked a question on fox by chris wallace and the answer was so bad i was watching which is hard to watch because its pretty boring to be honest but she said shes shortcircuited and i said to myself man thats a bad one oh shes going to have problems wait until you see tomorrow nothing what do you see the next day nothing and i said to a friend of mine can you imagine if i said that about myself i would be all over every paper anywhere in the world right its like i told you about you know sarcastically  i mean you ought to see these news organizations yesterday when i said obama right did you see that that obama is the founder of isis hes the mvp theyre going to be giving him the mvp award and shes right there next to him and you had to see and they left the mvp stuff out because then youd know but you had to hear did he mean it what does it mean we have nine panelists tonight  we have one  we have one panelist representing donald trump we have eight panelists plus the moderator and plus another few moderators come on folks get in here it is so ridiculous whats going on the pileon a man thats been doing this for  years said its the single greatest pileon of a candidate that hes ever seen every day every single day story after story after story and i think theyre going to be good stories you know i do good work ive built one of the great companies of this country i built this  i did one of the great jobs some of the great assets in the world very low debt tremendous cash flow thats why i can do this stuff believe me  you think its cheap its not cheap and by the way in the primaries i spent about  million something like that and  which believe it or not was about the lowest amount of money for the majors right and i came in first in a landslide others spent much more than that one spent many times more than that and came in toward the bottom of the pack and i said to myself isnt that what you want for a president right dont you want  you spend the least and you come in first  spend the least and come in first wouldnt that be nice and thats what we have to do thats what we have to do but hillary clinton will be so bad for our country will be so bad for our country and heres the thing the press doesnt go after her so she hasnt had a news conference in approximately  in fact her statement and a couple of other bad statements were made  oh dont worry about it go home go home like go home   so shes going home to mommy go home to mommy  go home go home and you know the nice part her mother is voting for donald trump its great  so its an amazing thing thats happening but they dont show her so she hasnt had a news conference in what  days something like that the little one that she had she tried to pretend they were all her friends and they were asking  and she gave such bad answers but i just said man look at these answers wow i dont want anybody to be hurt but i said shes really going to be hurt by those answers and what happened nothing although now i will tell you it was a little delayed reflex but shortcircuit really is catching on now very belatedly because we dont want a president thats going to shortcircuit we have bigger problems than that we have big problems in this country we dont need that so she wants to raise your taxes im going to lower your taxes she wants to raise your regulations and you heard mike and george talking about regulations theyre putting them out of business and were going to do such a massive decrease of regulation so that our small businesses can thrive and grow and start cant even start a small business  so we have  we have lots of things that were going to be working on but ill tell you big is were going to bring our companies back big and for this area honestly weve got to bring our companies back our companies have gone to mexico i tell it now for the last month i tell this this is so inexpensive because normally youd go out youd hire a big firm or youd hire the harvard guys or the wharton guys and theyd charge you a lot of money they do a report and they come back in six months theyd charge you a million dollars and you wouldnt know anything most of the reports youd just take them and throw them but a friend of mine builds plants right and hes just about the biggest in the world maybe he is the biggest in the world but he builds massive plants and i said to him how are you doing he said really well i said where he said donald you have to see what were doing in mexico we are building some of the great plants anywhere in the world car plants computer plants anything i said really he said its the eighth wonder of the world mexico and he wants to build here hes an american guy hes a us guy he wants to build here so i said hows the united states doing he goes just like this meh how stupid are we how stupid are we to allow this our companies are moving to mexico as we talk today and i said this before in erie because we had a crowd that was massive in erie  and somebody said its like a democrat area i dont think so ill tell you i dont think so we had this massive crowd of people but i said it to them we cant let our companies go without consequence we cant let our companies be stripped out of our country open up a plant somewhere because of a nafta agreement that was signed by bill clinton with a wife that wont be  she wont be able to do a damn thing about it  there have to be consequences when they leave and they fire all their people and the consequences when they make their product and they want to sell it through what will soon be a very very strong powerful border theyre going to pay a  percent tax on that product and theyre not going to leave they wont leave  dont worry about it folks they wont be leaving they wont be leaving so in this area because its been hit so hard and the coal has been hit so hard  you know in erie they have general electric and theyre stopping with the big locomotives its way down because the coal is way down its way way down tremendous unemployment well all of thats going to stop so were going to open our minds were going to work with our steelworkers and our miners and all of our people  and you know look my whole theme of what were doing is very simple hes got it on his cap there are hundreds of people that have it on their caps its called make america great again america first make america great again  now believe me the jobs are coming back folks thats going to be so easy a friend of mine said why didnt somebody else think of that and honestly they dont think of it because theyre politicians and other than bill who would understand that immediately right bill has no doubt and judy and he is bill is a business guy but these are politicians that number one are controlled by special interests and lobbyists right and donors and a lot of times they dont want it because they own companies that want to move across the border there are a lot of reasons a friend of mine recently said donald how could a certain deal have been made a month ago he said it doesnt make sense its so bad for the country he said boy those politicians are stupid i said no theyre not stupid theyre getting massive campaign contributions theyre getting massive donations isnt it nice that i do what i do and i just spend a lot of money ill tell you i hope i win im going to feel very very foolish if i dont win but when they call me because they need help in moving their company out of the united states and firing a lot of people folks i couldnt care less they didnt give me anything i couldnt care less were going to keep our companies and were going to bring new jobs back in and theyre going to come roaring back in with a new tax on business theyre going to come roaring back in and theyre coming in to this area and were going to cut regulations and our favorite unbelievably old company is going to thrive again hopefully better than its ever been since andrew jackson ok  so one of the things that we have to do and theres so many one of the things we have to do supreme court justices right the new president is going to have probably  next president probably more picks of supreme court justices we lost a great one with judge scalia lost a great one we lost a great one a great guy i met him a couple of times what a great great guy very conservative principles very smart and he wasnt  and that wasnt supposed to happen that was supposed to be another  years  years so we have one before we start we could have four we could even have five probably well have three but when i watch these people never trump those poor poor sad people theyve been saying never trump now for two years never trump never trump trump gets more votes than anybody in the history of the republican party and then never trump never trump never trump  i dont get it i dont get it never trump i mean we won massive numbers of states far more than  there wasnt even a secondplace finisher frankly so we won these massive numbers of states we won almost  million votes and thats with  people dont forget when ronald reagan ran  great guy by the way  when ronald reagan ran and when others that did well ran theyre running against two and three people and four people i ran against  people and got more votes think of what that means we got more votes than anybody we brought in new votes into the republican party thats all not being registered in different forms of media theyre not talking about the fact that the republican primaries were up  percent and the democrats were down  percent so with all the bernie stuff  and we like bernie look bernie the system was rigged and were going to watch pennsylvania very quickly were going to watch pennsylvania go down to certain areas and watch and study and make sure other people dont come in and vote five times because if you do that  and i know youre all voting is everybody here voting  if you do that if you do that were not going to lose the only way we could lose in my opinion i really mean this pennsylvania is if cheating goes on i really believe it because i looked at erie and it was the same thing as this and ive been all over the state and i know the state well i know the state well but let me just tell you i looked all over pennsylvania and im studying it and we have some great people here some great leaders here of the republican party and theyre very concerned about that and thats the way we can lose the state and we have to call up law enforcement and we have to have the sheriffs and the police chiefs and everybody watching because if we get cheated out of this election if we get cheated out of a win in pennsylvania which is such a vital state especially when i know whats happening here folks i know she cant beat whats happening here the only way they can beat it in my opinion and i mean this  percent if in certain sections of the state they cheat ok so i hope you people can sort of not just vote on the th go around and look and watch other polling places and make sure that its a hundred percent fine because without voter identification which is shocking shocking that you dont have it  many states it gets approved and some states they dont get approved and i have still  im supposed to be a smart person  i have still  i have yet to understand how you cannot approve voter identification at least in some form right so were going to do things that are going to be amazing i really believe on november th were doing well in florida were doing well in ohio i think were going to do well in virginia  were not doing as well there now but i actually think were doing really well i just dont think theyre giving us the credit were still pretty close but were doing really well in certain states that no other republican would even waste their time with were doing well in lots of different  were doing well in michigan hey look ive been talking about michigan being ripped off with their car companies moving to mexico for two years ok they dont talk hillary doesnt know about it hillary aye aye aye   four more years of obama but worse and run by the machine and total dishonesty total dishonesty i mean again look at the e mails remember  emails  emails and its ok its all right dont forget well maybe it is ok no it probably is   she needed a few for the wedding and she needed some for yoga class right so i figure two for yoga class five for the wedding where are the rest boy oh boy would i like to see hey can you imagine whats on those emails now they say that nsa has those emails you know that right they say they have them they say nsa has everybodys emails but they say that nsa has the emails so if they have the emails if they have the emails i think maybe should they give them out i dont know  i dont know i dont know what the law is but they say that they would have the emails i guess somebody came out from nsa and they said we have everybodys emails so i dont think they tried too hard do you folks i dont think they tried well see what happens the other thing we need we need security at our border the border patrol agents  border patrol agents endorse donald trump  sure of  the first time theyve ever done this in a presidential race  and believe me if they didnt their job is a lot easier just walk right by go ahead the other way they have to stop them bring them back its a lot more work theyre great people but  endorsed me sheriff joe arpaio from arizona like a great man hes been on the borders for  years i cant imagine and hes tough and hes smart and hes strong and hes a good person ill tell you  ive gotten to know him  thank you  ive gotten to know him very well hes a good person but he knows whats good and he knows whats fair and he endorsed me and that was a great honor ok and a lot of other people by the way a lot of other people but on the border  so heres the story so many people when i walked in would you read the snake tonight i dont know have you heard the snake anybody has anybody heard it raise your hand if youve heard it not that many its great is it ok for the ones that have heard it if i read it is that ok written by the great al wilson years ago so we need a strong border because drugs are pouring across crime is pouring across its rampant rampant and when i originally ran when i made my first statement i talked about illegal immigration i talked about problems that we have it turned out to be true  it turned out to be true so we have problems where our military is depleted we have to rebuild it we have problems where our vets arent being taken care of we have to take care of our vets  we have massive problems with education and we have to end common core and we have to bring education local  we have to repeal and replace obamacare we have to do it  we have to save our second amendment  the nra by the way endorsed me early i think it was the earliest endorsement theyve ever given but the nra endorsed me terrific people they love this country let me tell you they love this country  and you know its interesting san bernardino they walk in boom boom boom paris orlando so many places now paris actually has among the toughest gun laws anywhere in the world you dont have guns unless youre a bad guy you have guns because then youre allowed to walk in with guns right but you obey the law they dont have guns toughest gun laws they say in the world who knows so these thugs these horrible horrible  i was going to say human beings but i would say these horrible animals walk in to various places all fairly close together and they just start boom boom boom you get over here boom boom boom  killed many many hundreds people dont know this hundreds in the hospitals never really to recover i mean some are so badly wounded same thing san bernardino  people killed many many people still in the hospital i mean their lives can never be the same and im just saying if we had people in that room if we had some people in any of those rooms with a gun right around here   where when they see its going to happen the bullets start flying in the opposite direction  you really would have had a whole different story and you know if they knew that you had guns where the bullets are going to go in the opposite direction theyd probably say lets take a pass ok lets not even go in so were allowing  were allowing  tremendous numbers of people into our country from syria from parts of the massive terrorist world we have no idea who they are law enforcement says theres no way really to vet them theres no real paperwork theres a lot of false paperwork and were allowing  and hillary clinton wants to allow   percent more coming in than obama  so i read this today and so many people standing outside they heard me they said would you do it again i said ill do it again and its called the snake and it represents in my mind whats going to happen in our country because this is like the trojan horse were allowing people in and i have a bigger heart i have a big heart i want to take care of people i want to build safe zones in syria i want to have the gulf states pay for it we dont have  hey were at  trillion ok folks its time we stop weve spent probably  to  trillion in the middle east you know what we have nothing nothing if we would have done nothing in the middle east we would have been unbelievable so weve spent all of this money in the middle east we have nothing for it so heres the story i read this i immediately thought of our border ok immediately and i said to myself guess what im going to put this in the form of a poem and im going to read it when im of that mind because you see whats happening you see whats happening in germany you see whats happening in france look at france look at whats going on in france with nice with all of the things going on in france i have friends that wont go there anymore i have a friend he thinks paris the city of lights he thinks its the most beautiful city i said how are you doing did you go to paris yet this year i dont go to paris anymore france is no longer france how stupid are we how stupid are we when you see whats going on how stupid are we so were letting these people in right this is a tremendous mistake look at what one person did one sicko wacko whose father was sitting behind hillary rodham clinton with a big red hat on and a big smile on his face you see that was that a smile hes sitting behind her and as soon as i saw that and i heard he was there because he came over we think its him and he had a red hat i said oh no dont tell me but it wasnt it was not make america great again hat but you see this guy sitting back there and his son had just killed so many people in orlando and heres the story so i read this and a lot of people love it and think of it as what happens if were not smart tough and vigilant with our borders with people coming in that we dont know about them that we dont know who they are where they come from especially when you have a track record of violence all over the world what the hell do we need it for well build safe havens but what the  what are we doing so are you ready folks  called the snake on her way to work one morning down the path along the lake a tenderhearted woman saw a poor halffrozen snake his prettycolored skin had been all frosted with the dew oh well she cried ill take you in and ill take care of you take me in oh tender woman take me in for heavens sake take me in oh tender woman sighed the broken snake she wrapped him up all cozy in a curvature of silk then laid him by the fireside with some honey and some milk now she hurried home from work that night as soon as she arrived she found that pretty snake shed taken had been totally revived take me in oh tender woman take me in for heavens sake take me in oh tender woman sighed the broken snake now she clutched him to her bosom youre so beautiful she cried but if i hadnt brought you in by now you certainly might have died now she stroked his pretty skin and then she kissed and held him tight but instead of saying thank you that snake gave her a vicious bite take me in oh tender woman take me in for heavens sake take me in oh tender woman sighed the vicious snake i saved you cried that woman and youve bit me heavens why you know your bite is poisonous and now im going to die oh shut up silly woman said

you know that right your government officials dont even know many of them dont even know your governors dont know your senators dont know you dont even know this could be the great trojan horse this could replace the story of the trojan horse ok so i brought something special for you were going to go quickly because i want to get the hell out of here i want to go home  but im only leaving if you promise  if you promise  than on november th youre going to vote for trump and were going to make america great again  all right you ready all right congratulations pennsylvania great job great job

this ok go ahead go ahead a lot of them coming in from syria from places that are rough places ok rough places ok so heres something so i spent a lot of money on my campaign i continue to spend a lot of money on my campaign thats good and im not looking  you know im raising a lot of money for reince and for the whole republican party a lot of people dont understand that but thats ok but ive raised a lot of money we took in  million in june we took in  i think million dollars last month  and i dont think they even know im doing  ill be honest some of these people theyre saying like well we dont know if we like donald trump im raising so much money for these people oh but thats ok theyll figure it out soon im telling you soon theyre going to figure it out and the other ones you know when you hear never trump how about never trump think of this  think of this never trump never trump i told you we got the highest vote in history but never trump supreme court justice  so its not me its going to be hillary if its hillary youre going to have superleftleaning judges youre going to have a country thats destroyed probably forever it would be  years but probably forever ok how could they not say trump but they defeated and they were defeated theyve been saying for so long never trump years never trump and theyre embarrassed so we understand but you know what it doesnt matter because if we win it doesnt make any difference but ill tell you what im going to say never them never  so you see what i did here look so in one way i feel a little foolish to be honest i showed this yesterday i feel a little bit foolish hillary hillary  these are hedge funders now i know the hedge funders many of them some are semifriends of mine some are sort of friends of mine tough guys tough people tough women in a couple of cases not too many but tough tough people smart and they give her millions and millions of dollars theyre not doing that for their health theyre not doing that for the good of the country folks this i can tell you these are tough people frankly theyre people that id like negotiating for lets say against china you know we have all of these political hacks negotiating our deals but i have some like carl icahn i have some of the great people on my side some of the greatest businessmen in the world and they love it because they want great trade deals and were going to renegotiate our trade deals and hillary clinton said after hearing me yesterday we are going to renegotiate the other day we are going to renegotiate our trade deals she never even thought of it before and she cant do it because her donors wont allow her to do it folks a hundred percent do i know this business or what hey i used to be a donor now im a donor to myself for my own campaign  and you think its easy it takes guts to run for president dont kid yourself  so look at this one so this is a campaign contributions from hedge funders these are the tough ones hedge fund guys hedge fund people hillary clinton crooked hillary  trump  i dont even know who it is  and look they had a terrible picture of hillary which i felt was unfair i said dont do that get the best picture you can find and ill tell you what honestly i feel much better about it no they had this terrible picture it was unfair im a very fair person  against   im going to give the  back its ridiculous i dont know who the  this is just a list of some of the countries saudi arabia morocco oman kuwait bahrain algeria qatar these are millions of dollars given to hillary clinton you think she maybe will do what they want her to do so heres your total national debt total national debt its doubled under obama will more than double by the time he gets out and you know the bad thing  i was thinking about it today yes its tough but well be at  trillion nobody even knows what that is were going to be at  trillion but heres the thing if it doubled bill as an example if it doubled and our roads were in great shape and our schools and our hospitals and everything was good right if our bridges and tunnels were beautiful and new and fresh   percent of our bridges are in trouble our tunnels are a mess you ever go through these tunnels the tiles are falling off the roof right you know as a builder its disgusting to me you go through these tunnels and you say i wonder were people injured you see tiles you know they used to be beautiful white tiles right and now youll see big openings where patches have fallen off i say there are cars driving   miles an hour through i mean if those tiles fall and the people get killed right now i dont know i dont read about it but you look at our tunnels theyre disgusting theyre dirty theres soot the tiles are all off the roads are in bad shape so if you had  trillion and everything was tippytop  i like tippytop everyone who goes to my buildings and my clubs theyre tippytop right tippytop were opening up a hotel on pennsylvania avenue over a year ahead of schedule and way under budget and its the best and its better than we projected its going to be one of the great hotels of the world  pennsylvania avenue in washington dc so the way i look at it im going to get to pennsylvania avenue one way or the other i dont care i dont care i dont care  one way or the other but that hotel is under budget and ahead of schedule by more than a year wouldnt it be nice you know i was recently traveling to  i wont mention the location because theyre incredible people  but i was in an area where they have a hospital a veterans hospital thats under construction i said hows it doing oh mr trump sir its a disaster why is it a disaster its not that big why is it a disaster well we have a  billion  billion  cost overrun i said a billion dollars how can you have a billion how can you have  billion do you think those contractors and those subcontractors are making a couple of bucks on that folks how stupid are we to let this happen how stupid are we  billion for a hospital that should be a tiny fraction of that to build it to build it so heres the story folks we have to get out on november th im going to come back im going to be in pennsylvania a lot ill come back again and visit you  but youve got to get out and vote youve got to get out and vote and i promise you were going to do such a great job youre going to be so proud of your country youre going to be so proud  less importantly but youre going to be so proud of your president im a messenger im a messenger for common sense im a messenger for doing what we all know has to be done but we dont win anymore but were going to start winning again were going to win with our military which i said before is very very depleted but were going to build it up and were going to make it strong and were going to make it powerful and hopefully were not going to use it other than to knock the hell out of isis we have no choice  and were going to take care of our vets our great vets and they have not been taken care of and were going to have strong borders and by the way were going to build the wall and were going to stop drugs from coming in  and mexico is going to pay for the wall and were going to save our second amendment  and were going to repeal and replace obamacare  and were going to make the greatest trade deals weve ever made jobs are going to come flowing back were not going to let our companies go were going to be the smart people and were going to win and win and win and were going to win so much that the people in this room are going to call up their congressmen and say congressmen we cannot stand it our president is winning too much were not used to it please please mr congressman please go see the president and talk to him and im going to say when he comes into washington bill im sorry i cant do that actually i want to win much more were going to win so much were going to win at every single level were going to make america first and were going to make america great again thank you everybody thank you thank you everybody thank you thank you everybody"
48,"Trump","thank you thank you everybody thank you unbelievable thank you very much thank you very much its a great honor thank you  amazing amazing what great people were going to bring back our jobs to pennsylvania were going to bring back our jobs to the united states  going to bring back our jobs folks ive looked at the numbers and i see whats happening in pennsylvania i see whats happening all over our country  you look at new york state you look at new england you look anywhere in the country where you want to go to all over its the same manufacturing way down jobs way down you go to other countries theyre taking our companies theyre taking our jobs people are right now working harder than theyve ever worked eighteen years ago they made more money in real wages  years think of it eighteen years ago many of the people in this incredibly big room and thank you for being here you know its  degrees out  and they still have a lot of people trying to get in i dont know if they can get them in should we let them in just let them in  but  years ago people were making more money in real wages than they make today and today theyre working two jobs some people are working three jobs so theyre older and theyre working harder and theyre making less money all right a friend of mine ive been telling this story over the last month because its better than going to wharton or better than going to harvard and asking them to do a study because you learn it in three minutes but let me just tell you right now mexico and other countries are building facilities plants the likes of which youve never seen were going to build the wall dont worry were going to build the wall were going to build it were going to build it  but a friend of mine and actually a supporter big supporter great guy he builds plants thats what he does he builds plants he doesnt want to build apartments he doesnt want to build office buildings he wants to build plants and hes just about the biggest there is and i said how are things going he said very well how are you doing in the us not good how are you doing in mexico he said donald do you want to see its the eighth wonder of the world they are building plants the likes of which ive never seen hes building some of the greatest plants big  you look at ford moving vast operations to mexico the plants you look at  look at take a look by the way millions of jobs thousands of companies over the years theyve left us and we have a few things we have unemployment we have empty plants i saw up in new york state i saw it in pennsylvania you were great to meet you voted a big victory for donald trump thank you  that was a big victory i mean i assumed i was going  if i dont win pennsylvania  and by the way i was talking to our great congressman and where is he hes here some place where is he  he loves the people and i have to say of all of pennsylvania he wants to see this state do well thank you but just talking back to a few of my friends that live here we have a few of the friends and we see whats happened with general electric where theyre cutting way back not going to happen and you know why theyre cutting back its one reason because we dont take care of our miners and were not producing coal and they dont need to make those big big beautiful you could call them locomotives i guess right whatever the hell they are theyre big and theyre powerful and they dont need them like they used to because we dont make our government work for us theyre not working for us theyre working for others theyre not working for us so when general electric goes out and you see the numbers i see the numbers and its about coal so i just left parts of virginia and west virginia and the coal industrys decimated the miners are out of work theyre totally out of work i mean there will be no such thing as coal in this country pretty soon and were talking clean coal were talking clean coal  so i was with the miners we have such tremendous support west virginia the mining parts of virginia all over ohio because hillary clinton made the statement not so long ago a number of months she said were going to put the mines and miners out of business all right going to put the mines and the miners  so  so were not going to let that happen were not going to let that happen and were not going to let it happen in pennsylvania because you know what a lot of your miners have already lost their jobs but you have a lot of other jobs that are very reliant on the mines like as an example general electric and what were going to do folks is going to be so special were going to bring it back were going to bring back our jobs were going to bring back our companies  when a company wants to leave our country to go to another country and think theyre going to make their product and because our politicians are weak stupid taken care of by lobbyists special interests  theyre taken care of by lobbyists theyre taken care of by donors and special interests thats what  you know a friend of mine  very smart guy  said  i cant believe it were talking about a deal that took place about a month ago he said i cant believe they could have gotten that through i said why cant you believe it well its so bad for the country i said yeah but its good for the politician because theyre taken care of by their lobbyists and their donors and the special interests so even though you say we want as an example general electric to produce more if they dont want to or if for some reason one of the donors of crooked hillary clinton doesnt want that to happen even though its great for erie even though its great you even though its great for the state of pennsylvania then its not going to happen folks its not going to happen and by the way  and i have to tell you this so when they think theyre going to take our companies are rip them out of  as an example  this area or this state or any other state and go to mexico and build massive new plants and employ people other than you and youre going to lose your jobs or youre going to now get two part time jobs that dont add up to half of what you used to make that stuff isnt happening anymore so heres what happens theyre going to build that plant now if i were here five years ago and if president obama put me and maybe secretary of keeping business in the united states  thats my title secretary of keeping business in the united states  i mean i like the sound of secretary of defense better oh and by the way were going to build our military were going to be very strong  really  and were going to take care of our vets were going to take care of our vets believe me  but i like the sound  i like the sound of secretary of defense i like the sound of secretary of the treasury i like the sound of secretary of state but ill tell you would i be good at keeping jobs over here would i be   ill tell you this i just have to say the bernie sanders protesters were much much stronger they had much more passion i have to say   all right you know whats interesting if i could speak to them for like five minutes  we want a strong military we want to take care of our people we want good education we want good housing we want good healthcare what do we want were all in for the same thing  really amazing really amazing so ill be your secretary of keeping companies in the united states right so i would go to a company like carrier air conditioner which decided to leave indianapolis indiana and i would say heres the story we think its wonderful that youre negotiating with mexico im sure youre going to have a wonderful plant but heres whats going to happen if you build that plant and you fire all of these people  people who were so great to me indiana i won that in a landslide actually the timing was good i won it in a landslide because i know what to do hillary doesnt know what to do did you see her yesterday she has no clue about what were talking about folks she has no clue she has no clue crooked hillary she doesnt know anything about it and by the way if she did she couldnt do it anyway because her donors dont want to do it theres reasons but look look i would go to them and say just to keep them just to keep them and i wouldnt even care that much ill tell you why ready id say heres the story if you leave in this case indianapolis youre going to go to mexico youre going to make your air conditioning units every single unit that you make that crosses our now very very strong border were going to charge you  percent of the cost of that unit ok thirty five percent right so simple thirty five percent the cost of that unit we hope you enjoy your new plant very hot weather out there very hot we hope you enjoy your new plant but  percent is coming to us now heres whats going to happen if they havent moved yet a lot of them have moved weve lost thousands and thousands of companies weve lost millions of jobs  too late i should have been there  years ago nobody would have left nobody would have left because you need the right messenger you know im your messenger in terms of this movement but you need the right person saying it so heres whats going to happen normally theyd call up whoever it is that was putting the little order down like the new president and theyd have one of their lobbyists call up and theyd say hillary im sorry you cant do that they gave you  million for your campaign cant do that hillary ok i wont do that with me im putting my money up folks im putting my money up putting my money up were raising money for reince and for the rnc but thats for a lot of other reasons we are putting  im putting a lot of money up i financed my  i funded not financed i wish i financed right i funded but i funded my primaries and i spent less than anybody else in terms of the measures  so heres a story  wouldnt that be nice i spent less and won in a landslide other people spent much much more three four five times more and they came in seventh who the hell do you want to have as your president right right right oh boy and then they dont like me  couple of them most of them have really supported us but some of them just cant get over it you know what i say to them get over it were just having fun get over it you signed a pledge i hereby guarantee that i will endorse whoever wins  you know the funny thing all those pledges you know they were signed for different  they were signed so that i would sign it and i would have honored it i will say even if i wasnt fond or didnt like  i would have honored it because a pledge is a very important thing but heres the thing so we are going to take these companies that havent left  now im looking at your numbers folks youre not doing too well  youre not doing too well here pennsylvania has lost one in three manufacturing jobs since  you know thats massive since nafta nafta was signed by bill clinton and i believe its the single worst trade document ever signed in the history of our country and probably in the history of our world its one of the most onesided documents that ive ever seen and it allowed mexico and places to do unbelievably well at our expense and did you see where say im going to renegotiate nafta im going to  tpp disaster ok dont worry dont worry and hillary was in favor of tpp she said its the gold standard thank you for reminding me i like this guy its the gold standard tpp transpacific partnership it is going to be  i dont think you can be worse than nafta honestly but its going to be as bad as nafta so tpp she said it is the gold standard shes reading it from a teleprompter it is the gold standard  oh boy our country is in trouble our country is in trouble our country is in trouble so she said its the gold standard but when she heard me make a speech as i understand it and she heard me talking very negatively about it as an example they dont talk devaluation which is the single greatest tool that these countries are using to kill the united states including china they devalue their currency well it doesnt happen mention  number one thing is not mentioned so complicated this agreement too many countries by the way i believe trade i believe in trade deals one country at a time boom boom boom you got to see the lines well have one line and if they dont do well if they dont behave themselves if they want to start devaluing their currency all over the place very simple we write them a notice like we do in business we serve them with a  day notice  and by the way you just saw how great are our police right  law and order we need law and order we need law and order and we will have law and order our police our firemen  but our police do a fantastic job they are not recognized for the great job they do if they have  incidents all positively beautifully handled one bad thing happens that one bad thing is on the news for two weeks and its a disgrace its a disgrace so we should be very thankful for the job they do so pennsylvania is losing a lot of its business right now were sitting here were talking  oh heres another one go home to mom go home to mom  and your mother is voting for trump shes voting for trump its true its true by the way just to interject  so i was told this whole area is democratic meaning democrat and i was told that by a lot of different people outside and then they said i cant believe that you have  people you have people outside trying to get in they said the came up to me this is  happens to be a democrat who i happen to know is a good guy  came up to me and said ive never seen anything like it it always goes democrat is that a correct statement said you are going to win erie in a and the surrounding area  youre going to win in a landslide gonna be a landslide  because people are tired of lies theyre tired of losing their jobs theyre tired of seeing their companies being ripped out and going to other places theyre tired of china coming in and dropping steel all over the place to put your companies out of business so we have to go to china to get our steel which is happening very quickly and thats why the steel workers are with me thats why the miners are with me thats why the working people electricians the plumbers the sheetrockers the concrete guys and gals theyre all  theyre with us and i grew up you know they say you know youre really rich how come you sort of relate to these people well my father built houses and i used to work in these houses and i got to know the electricians i got to know all these people i got to know the plumbers the steamfitters  i got to know them all  and i liked them better than the rich people that i know i know a lot of rich people its true theyre better i like them better so anyway  and we are going to put people back to work were not playing games and its going to go quickly by the way its going to go quickly but look at this ok so erie has lost one in three manufacturing jobs you know that all i  you do  i flew over youre looking at the plants plants that  years ago  years ago  years ago some two years ago were vibrant but no plant two years ago was too vibrant because it was down to half down to a quarter down to a tenth and then ultimately they closed but you see them they are falling over the rain the sleet the snow the wind these are great buildings that are falling apart dont feel bad all over the country upstate new york is a disaster which hillary clinton said that she was going to fix ok so the washington post is extraordinarily dishonest and thats fine but they wrote a story i couldnt believe i saw this story they talked about hillary clinton it was a headline hillary clinton and when she ran for the united states senator from new york she said to the people in upstate new york which was starting to really have problems because of her husbands bill nafta and companies were leaving tremendous unemployment tremendous problems making nothing and she said i will turn it around i will create  jobs were going to do a great job guess what she got elected she did nothing and the only ones that benefited were the consultants and the people that helped her out it is a disaster upstate new york is right now worse than anything you have in the state of pennsylvania she did nothing and i watched her yesterday which was hard to do because she is boring ok  i watched her yesterday talking about  you know whats funny i said im going to renegotiate nafta and they said what happens if you cant make a deal i said were going to terminate were getting out and  so ive been saying that and ive been saying were going to renegotiate different trade deals and were going to make great trade deals and all this and shes never said that all of a sudden two days ago i will renegotiate trade deals shes not going to do it folks shes going to renegotiate trade deals the same way she was going to put  jobs in upstate new york it turned out to be a total fantasy and i have to tell you i respect the washington post for writing one bad story because you what theyre doing and reince was alluding to it a little bit the only way she gets elected is if they dont report on her they dont show her they have me on so much television theres cnn you talk about dishonesty its called the clinton  wait  its called the clinton news network cnn now think of it clinton is  shes hardly ever on so yesterday they have yesterday a scandal with the emails another one im not talking about the  emails that she deleted or got rid of can you imagine what was on those emails can you imagine i love that can you imagine what was on those emails  emails were deleted and she said well it had to do with the wedding and yoga i give two to yoga i give five to the wedding ill tell you the lies the deception were running like they run right now a third world country folks ok you saw what happened its running like a third world country were being talked about all over the world nobody can believe it in fact when they were going over the charges against hillary clinton one after another after another after another however and yet other people their lives have been destroyed for doing much less all right  their lives have been destroyed so now they have a big scandal in new york its in the new york papers but very little pay right pay for play and its horrifying its horrifying our government is for sale our government is for sale by a crooked person and what theyre doing is theyre trying to not talk about her take a look you go to cnn as an example story after story about trump story  trump trump trump trump and yesterday it was announced that people are tired of negative  the hit jobs and cnns starting to do very poorly thats good i like that i like that and i have to say fox has been treating us fairly fox has been fair but cnn has been catastrophic its so dishonest but somebody was explaining to me their theory if they dont report on her people arent going to know how bad she is look at her news conference she hasnt had a news conference in like  days that last one wasnt a news conference that was a few of her friends they asked her a question what did she say about the circuit right let me tell you if i ever said that short circuited if i ever said i shortcircuited it would be headlines all over the world they would call for the death penalty  can you imagine if i said that i shortcircuited i mean i stand up here for months in front of massive crowds she gets  people going to her events she gets  people and then she reads something from a teleprompter and then she leaves and she goes home and she goes to sleep  and then she wakes and she goes again and im telling you  and nobody does anything about it now me i stand up here  im not looking at notes im not reading teleprompters not easy not easy not easy  but  but  remember  but  and if i make one mistake  say he mention something wrong he got a wrong date its like headlines all over she can say she shortcircuited up here i dont want a president who shortcircuits is that ok i dont want it i dont want a president who shortcircuits  weve got to deal with isis weve got to deal with china weve got to deal with lots of people theyre not shortcircuiting but i dont want somebody that shortcircuits so let me just tell you  let me just tell you over the last little while  you know every time its always a big deal when i said that obama  and of course im being sarcastic and they know that because after i said that i said hes the mvp hes going to collect his mvp award ok so i said obama is the founder of isis the founder  and these dishonest media people  theyre the most dishonest people they said oh did he mean that didnt he mean that and after that id say a lot  in fact they like him so much because hes been so weak and so bad i mean he let this happen they had eight states they had eight countries theyre now in  countries theyre expanding so i said the founder of  obviously im being sarcastic then  then  but not that sarcastic to be honest with you  and they all said he should not say that they should call him an enabler call him an enabler hes an enabler i said that doesnt sound the same hes an enabler people are going to say whats  these people are the worst but listen so i said the founder of isis and in fact very soon hes going over to pick up his most valuable player award did i say that i say it all the time  so they knew i was being sarcastic by now theyre analyzing did i really mean that how could i say that these people are the lowest form of life im telling you the lowest  they are the lowest form of humanity not all of them they have about  percent that are pretty good actually but most of them ok so heres the story so erie has lost a lot right you know that right hang in dont leave i promise we can fix it so fast we will stop these countries from taking our jobs we will stop these countries from taking our companies hold on our jobs will come back now i came up with a great plan im lowering corporate taxes so our companies stay so i dont even have to make the call the corporate inversions  you know we have companies that have they say two and a half trillion dollars outside of our comp   they cant get their money back we dont let them everybody agrees that we should do it republicans democrats everybody agrees whats the  look why do we not want them to bring money back you know why because we dont have a president that can sit the leaders of both parties around a table and in about five minutes let them say lets bring this money back in so we can work it in this country right thats what it is so were going to bring that money back in were going to lower taxes were going to keep our companies  and if our companies want to leave theyre going to pay a nice big beautiful tax to get their product back in ok thats whats going to happen so the existing us trade deficit with tpp participating nations has already cost pennsylvania  jobs folks no more folks were not going to be stupid people any more were going to be the really really smart people its going to be america first america first america first first  so the destruction of manufacturing in pennsylvania was caused by hillary clintons and her husbands disastrous trade policies i mean you take a look at what shes done at the bidding of her corporate funders hillary clinton has backed every jobkilling trade deal for decades she has received so much money she has approved virtually every tax increase put before her yesterday  you see  trillion in tax increases were the highest taxed nation in the land essentially were the highest taxed nation in the world anywhere in the world and of the industrialized nations were far and away the highest taxed nation and shes proposing a massive tax increase folks we cant do it its going to make our country noncompetitive  its already noncompetitive its going to make our country noncompetitive and were not going to do it im proposing a massive tax decrease for the middle class for business and businesses are going to pour in  not since ronald reagan has anything like this been proposed businesses instead of leaving because their taxes are so high theyre going to stay i might not even have to make those calls now if i do i will meaning my people will ill do some i love doing it i would love telling some guy youre not moving well mr president sir we would like to move to mexico youre not moving and if you do you pay the  percent tax you say well in that case im not moving im not moving in that case im not moving so easy so your coal industry your steel industry which has been ravaged your general electrics of the world which have been ravaged just ravaged were going to end it and ill tell you why over the years ive watched for years for  years for  years for  years beyond obama and ive watched as politicians talked about stopping countries from leaving  companies from leaving our states you need strength is right our states and i watched remember they give the lowinterest loans heres a lowinterest loan if you stay in pennsylvania heres a zerointerest loan you dont have to pay heres a this heres tax abatement of any kind you want well help your  it doesnt work folks thats not what they need they have money they want to go out they want to move to another country and because our politicians are so dumb they want to sell their product to us and not have any retribution not have any consequences  so all of thats over and i think you understand it and hillary cant do it number one she cant do it because the mentality isnt there she cant do it no the mentality you know she said fairly recently i dont like donald trumps tone his tone isnt nice and i said here we have a country thats being taken advantage of by every country in the world our businesses are being taken our jobs being taken everythings being taken here we have a world where isis is chopping off the heads of christians and many others drowning people in steel cages burying people in the sand and we have somebody up there who wants to be our president that says i dont like donald trumps tone  folks we better get smart folks hey look lets see what happens we better get smart we better get smart  we better get smart we better get tough and if were not smart and were not tough were not going to have a country left and one of the things i have to talk to you about before i leave is our borders illegal immigrants are pouring into our country in fact i brought something for you people i brought  i brought  i had to do this i didnt want to depress you ok look the clinton legacy nearly one in three manufacturing jobs in erie pa  erie pa sound familiar  have been lost since clinton allowed a certain deal with china to happen now look at this  look at this chart this is  not long ago this is now congratulations folks i hope youre doing well ok i hope youre doing well i dont want to hurt them i hope youre doing well but you know what you cant do well when you have a government that is so stupid that is so  that is so incompetent you cant do it heres another one folks this is what were talking about syrian refugees  we have no idea who they are where theyre coming from no paperwork you saw what happened in san bernardino you saw what happened  frankly take a look at all over the world take a look at whats happening if we dont get smart and we dont get smart fast  barack obama is allowing syrian refugees to come into our country by the thousands now i have as big a heart as anybody in this room and i want to build safe zones and i want by the way the gulf states to pay for it because theyve got plenty of money and theyre not doing much ok well supervise it opm other peoples money well supervise it right well supervise it but theyre going to pay for it because were protecting these people if it werent for the united states those countries wouldnt even exist theyd be gone the power we have is so enormous but we have people that dont know what theyre doing we have an incompetent president we have people that dont know what theyre doing so look at this look at this syrian refugees admitted to the united states on a monthly basis look whats happening look whats happening  now in all fairness we want to help people cant take a chance san bernardino they walk in they start shooting paris the best the toughest gun laws in the world paris france they walk in they kill  people they wound so gravely hundreds of people now let me just tell you because well  were on  the second amendment right second amendment if we had in san bernardino  if we had in san bernardino or in orlando or someplace somebody in that room like this guy right here right or that guy with the blue make america great again hat on or the one with the red make america  or that woman with the beautiful blonde hair i wish i had hair that looked like that  but if we had somebody and they happened to have a gun san bernardino they see him come in  first of all if they knew there was a gun where the bullets would be flying in the other direction they probably wouldnt have got  in ok but lets assume they did  the carnage would not have been what the carnage was we have to protect our second amendment hillary clinton wants to kill our second amendment  she wants to kill it  so heres our chart and i was thinking about doing a  i bring  every once in a  like one in ten i do it you know a lot of these i love the people we have such a movement going on who likes the snake do you know the snake do you like it who likes the snake here we are with this we know bad things are going to happen we know as we allow more and more people to come in from these terror areas bad things are going to happen has anybody heard the snake not that many should i do it again so think of this folks think of this think of it this is what is going on in our country with our borders and by the way were going to have a strong border were going to have a wall its going to be a powerful wall that mexicos going to pay for the wall  and we have no choice and we have no choice but think of this this is now a situation where this was written by al wilson many years ago and i read it and i said you know that really pertains to whats happening to the united states and it has to do with being fooled it has to do with a lot of different things but when youre listening to this think of our border think of the people that were letting in by the thousands and hillary clinton you saw those numbers right with the chart its through the roof hillary clinton wants to allow  percent more coming into our country how stupid are we so are you ready you ready you like it you sure on her way to work one morning down the path along the lake a tender hearted woman saw a poor halffrozen snake his pretty colored skin had been all frosted with the dew oh well she cried ill take you in and ill take care of you take me in oh tender woman take me in for heavens sake take me in oh tender woman sighed the broken snake she wrapped him up all cozy in a curvature of silk then laid him by the fireside with some honey and some milk now she hurried home from work that night as soon as she arrived she found that pretty snake shed taken in had been revived take me in oh tender woman take me in for heavens sake take me in oh tender woman sighed the broken snake now she clutched him to her bosom youre so beautiful she cried but if i hadnt brought you in by now you certainly would have died now she stroked his pretty skin and then she kissed and held him tight but instead of saying thank you that snake gave her a vicious bite take me in oh tender woman take me in for heavens sake take me in oh tender woman sighed the vicious snake i saved you i saved you i saved you cried that woman and youve bit me heavens why you know your bite is poisonous and now im going to die oh shut up silly woman said the reptile with a grin you knew damn well i was a snake before you took me in   get ready folks get ready were led by stupid people were led by leaders and you know honestly i didnt need this this i didnt need i had a nice life built a great company  a great company some of the great real estate assets of the world i may never see them you know if i win i may never see them again and i love them  all over the world but you know what this is so important and i watched what was happening with the iran deal and i watched what was happening with jobs and i watched what was happening with trade where china makes  billion in trade deficits with us i look and i saw take a look at mexico you know the politicians say youll never ever be able to get mexico to allow you to build a wall i say trust me now they dont say that anymore now they say they wont put the money up to build a wall so easy mexico  our trade deficit is massive massive they make a fortune off the stupidity of the united stated mexico will  percent  you hear   percent pay for the wall  percent  ok one hundred percent but the story of the snake is whats happening to our country were letting people in many of these people hate us many of these people dont have good thoughts and you see what one person can do  one sick wacko can do in orlando and then you see his father sitting behind hillary clinton with a big smile on his face  with a big fat smile on his face right and he was wearing a red hat and i said i hope thats not one of my hats it wasnt i was concerned i saw that hat i said i hope it doesnt say make america great again bad guy  bad guy horrendous son  horrendous son so heres the story folks we have to win  we have to win pennsylvania so important so  hillary clinton is run by people that do this very professionally theyre very good they keep her out of the spotlight she doesnt talk to reporters  very rarely she doesnt do press conferences she doesnt expose whatevers going on up here she doesnt  which isnt good she doesnt expose her mind to questions and what they want to do is they want to try and fake it through we need strength we need toughness we need a strong temperament we need a strong tone at the same time  at the same time let me tell you  at the same time we need real big beautiful heart because we have to straighten out healthcare obamacares going to be repealed and replaced its going to repay  did you see  did you see whats happening with obamacare  did you see where the numbers are going up   and  percent wait until you see what happens on november st now on november st theyre trying to delay it but youre going to get increases the likes of which probably no country nobody has ever seen ok anybody in the history of healthcare  in texas through going through blue cross blue shield they just had almost a  percent increase in their premiums and the deductibles are so high that unless you get hit by one of those general electric locomotives and you live for like a long time prior to death youll never ever be able to use your healthcare  the healthcare because heres whats happened  heres whats happened the deductible is so high you never get to use it so youre spending money your  raises by    percent but now its going to go really bad really bad its going to die of its own volition but we have to kill it first its killing our country its killing our jobs  its killing our jobs so heres the story folks  folks we have to win pennsylvania we have to beat this professional group of people that are running her for her own  for their own purposes we have to win pennsylvania we win pennsylvania were going to win it you know were up in florida were doing well in ohio and im hearing were doing well here well find out heres the story  heres the story we have to win the state of pennsylvania i went to school here my kids went to school here were going to win pennsylvania  if we win pennsylvania ill tell you what we are very much on our way you know the republicans do have a tougher path just so you  not my fault not my fault its a tougher path for the presidency its just a tougher winding road but if win pennsylvania we win florida where were doing really well i think we can win ohio itll be over itll be over itll be over  so on november th you have to get out and vote or do some balloting and i dont care  look heres the story if youre not feeling well if youre so sick if you go to your doctor and he goes

devastated supreme court he said yes yes thank you who did that who said that thank you by the way and i have to just stop for a second look supreme court justice scalia great was supposed to live for a long time he died so you have already an empty this next president could have the most supreme court nominations of any president could take more justices than  it could be up to five probably going

same we will have problems like weve never had before and you wont have  you will have a whole different deal going which we dont want believe me so heres the story if for no other reason i am going

49,"Trump","thank you thank you everybody thank you very much its great to be with you this afternoon and today we begin a conversation about how to make america safe again in the th century the united states has defeated fascism nazism and communism now a different threat challenges our world radical islamic terrorism this summer theres been an isis attack launched outside the war zones of the middle east  hard to believe  every  hours here in america we have seen one brutal attack after another thirteen were murdered and  wounded in the assault on fort hood the boston marathon bombing wounded and maimed  people and ultimately left five dead including two of our great police officers in chattanooga tennessee five unarmed marines   unbelievable people by the way  were shot and killed in a military recruiting center last december  innocent americans were gunned down at an office party in san bernardino another  were very gravely injured in june  americans were executed at the pulse night club in orlando another  were badly injured it was the worst mass shooting in our history and the attack by far the worst on the lgbtq community and ill tell you what we can never ever allow this to happen again  in europe  thank you  in europe we have seen the same carnage and bloodshed afflicted upon our closest allies in january of  a french satirical newspaper charlie hebdo was attacked for publishing cartoons of the prophet mohammed twelve were killed including two police officers and  were wounded two days later four were murdered in a jewish delicatessen in november of  terrorist went on a shooting rampage in paris that slaughtered  people and wounded another  people some in very very very bad shape today  france is suffering gravely and the tourism industry is being massively affected in the most negative way in march of this year terrorists detonated a bomb in brussels airport killing  and injuring  people this july in the south of france an islamic terrorist turned his truck into an instrument of mass murder plowing down and killing  men women and children and wounding  people terrible among the dead were two americans a texas father and his yearold son a few weeks ago in germany a refugee armed with an axe wounded  people in a gruesome train attack only days ago an isis killer invaded a christian church in normandy france forced an yearold priest to his knees a priest who was beloved who was beloved before cutting his throat and just unthinkable other things overseas isis has carried out an absolute atrocity and one after another children slaughtered girls sold into slavery men and women burned alive crucifixions beheadings and drownings ethnic minorities targeted for mass execution holy sites desecrated christians driven from their homes and hunted for extermination isis rounding up what it calls nation of the cross nation of the cross in a campaign of absolute and total genocide we cannot let this evil continue  thank you thank you nor can we let the hateful ideology of radical islam its oppression of women gays children and nonbelievers be allowed to reside or spread within our own countries  we will defeat radical islamic terrorism just as we have defeated every threat weve faced at every age and before but we will not we will not remember this defeat it with closed eyes or silenced voices we have a president that doesnt want to say the words anyone who cannot name our enemy is not fit to lead our country  anyone who cannot condemn the hatred oppression and violence of radical islam lacks the moral clarity to serve as our president  the rise of isis is the direct result of policy decisions made by president obama and secretary of state clinton lets look back at the middle east at the very beginning of  before the obamaclinton administration took over libya was stable syria was under control egypt was ruled by a secular president and an ally of the united states iraq was experiencing a reduction in violence the group that would become what we now call isis was close to being extinguished iran was being choked off by economic sanctions fast forward to today what we have  and think of this  and the decisions made by the obamaclinton group have been absolutely disastrous libya is in ruins our ambassador and three other really brave americans are dead and isis has gained a new base of operations syria is in the midst of a disastrous civil war isis controls large portions of territory a refugee crisis now threatens europe and the united states in egypt terrorists have gained a foothold in the sinai desert near the suez canal one of the most essential waterways of the world iraq is in chaos and isis is on the loose isis has spread across the middle east and into the west in  isis was operating in seven nations they were in seven nations terrible but thats what it was today theyre fully operational in  countries with aspiring branches in six more for a total of  and many believe that number is actually  to  countries they dont even know the situation is likely worse than the public has any idea a new congressional report reveals that the administration has downplayed the growth of isis with  percent of analysts saying they had experience efforts to manipulate their findings in trying to make it look much better than it is its bad at the same time isis is trying to infiltrate refugee flows into europe and to the united states iran the worlds largest state sponsor of terrorism is not flush with  billion in cash released by the united states plus if you remember from two weeks ago another  million in actual cash that was obviously used for ransom worst of all the nuclear deal puts iran the number one state sponsor of radical islamic terrorism on a path to nuclear weapons in short the obamaclinton foreign policy has unleashed isis destabilized the middle east and put the nation of iran which chants death to america in a dominant position of regional power and in fact aspiring a dominant world power it all began in  with what has become known as president obamas global apology tour we all remember we all remember  in a series of speeches president obama described america as arrogant dismissive derisive and a colonial power he was describing us  he informed other countries that he would be speaking up about americas past errors he pledged that we would no longer be a senior partner that sought to dictate our terms he lectured cia officers of the need to acknowledge their mistakes and described guantanamo bay as a rallying cry for our enemies perhaps no speech was more misguided than president obamas speech to the muslim world delivered in cairo egypt  i remember it well in winning the cold war president ronald reagan repeatedly touted the superiority of freedom over communism and called the ussr the evil empire yet when president obama delivered his address in cairo no such moral courage could be found or would be found instead of condemning the oppression of women and gays in many muslim nations and the systematic violations of human rights or the financing of global terrorism president obama tried to draw an equivalency between our human rights record  and remember this our human rights  and theirs the records are unbelievable and unmistakable his naive words were followed by even more naive actions the failure to establish a new status of forces agreement in iraq and the electiondriven timetable for withdrawal surrendered our gains in that country and led directly to the rise of isis without question  the failures in iraq were compounded by hillary clintons disaster total disaster in libya president obama has since said that he regrets and really regrets libya and the mistake he made he considers it his worst mistake according to thensecretary of defense robert gates the invasion of libya was nearly a split decision but hillary clintons forceful advocacy for the intervention was the deciding factor thats why we went in with one episode of bad judgment after another hillary clintons policies launched isis onto the world stage yet as she threw the middle east into violent turmoil things turned out really to be not so hot for our world and our country the middle east in particular the clintons made almost  in gross income while she was secretary of state it is unbelievable incident after incident proves again and again hillary clinton lacks the judgment  as said by bernie sanders  stability and temperament and the moral character to lead our nation  importantly she also lacks the mental and physical stamina to take on isis and all of the many adversaries we face not only in terrorism but in trade and every other challenge we must confront to turn our great country around  it is now time for a new approach our current strategy of nationbuilding and regimechange is a proven absolute failure we have created the vacuums that allow terrorism to grow and thrive i was an opponent of the iraq war from the beginning a major difference between me and my opponent though i was a private citizen whose personal opinions on such matters were really not sought i nonetheless publicly expressed my private doubts about the invasion i was against believe me three months before the invasion i said in an interview with neil cavuto to whom i offer my best wishes for a speedy recovery that perhaps we shouldnt be doing it yet and that the economy is a much bigger problem in august of  very early right after the conflict i made a detailed statement to esquire magazine in an interview heres the quote in full look at the war in iraq and the mess were in i would never have handled it that way this was right after the invasion does anybody really believe that iraq is going to be a wonderful democracy where people are going to run down to the voting box and gently put in their ballot and the winner is happily going to go and step up and lead the country come on i then continued two minutes after we leave theres going to be a revolution and the meanest toughest smartest most viscous guy in this case guy will take over and hell have weapons of mass destruction which saddam hussein did not have what was the purpose of this whole thing hundreds and hundreds of young people killed and what about the people coming back with no arms and no legs not to mention in all fairness the other side the tremendous damage done all those iraqi kids whove been blown to pieces and it turns out that all of the reasons for the war were blatantly wrong all of this death and destruction for nothing so ive been clear for a long time that we should not have gone in but i have been just as clear in saying what a catastrophic mistake hillary clinton and president obama made with the reckless way in which they pulled out after we had made those hard fought sacrifices and gains we should have never made such a sudden withdrawal on a timetable advertised to our enemies they said were moving out heres our time heres our date who would do this but an incompetent president al qaeda in iraq had been decimated and obama and clinton gave it new life and allowed it to spread all across the world by that same token president obama and hillary clinton should have never attempted to build a democracy in libya to push for immediate regime change in syria or to support the overthrow of mubarak in egypt one more point on this i have long said that we should have kept the oil in iraq  i said it over and over and over again another area where my judgment has been proven correct i just said it so many times virtually every time i was interviewed keep the oil keep the oil according to cnn isis made as much as  in oil sales in  alone thats before they really got started fueling and funding its reign of terror if we had controlled the oil like i said we should we could have prevented the rise of isis in iraq both by cutting off a major source of funding and through the presence of us forces necessary to safeguard the oil and vital infrastructure products necessary for us to have the oil i was saying this constantly and consistently to whomever would listen i said keep the oil keep the oil keep the oil dont let somebody else get it  if they had listened to me then we would have had the economic benefits of the oil which i wanted to use to help take care of the wounded soldiers and families of those who died in the war  in addition to which thousands of lives would have been saved this proposal by its very nature would have left soldiers in place of our assets we would have had soldiers there guarding this valuable supply of oil in the old days when we won a war to the victor belonged the spoils  instead all we got from iraq and our ventures in the middle east was death destruction and tremendous financial loss but its time to put the mistakes of the past behind us and chart a new course  if i become president the era of nationbuilding will be brought to a very swift and decisive end  thank you our new approach  which must be shared by both parties in america by our allies overseas and by our friends in the middle east  must be to halt the spread of radical islam all actions should be oriented around this goal and any country which shares this goal will be our ally very important some dont share this goal we cannot always choose our friends but we can never fail to recognize our enemies  as president i will call for an international conference focused on this goal we will work side by side with our friends in the middle east including our greatest ally israel  we will partner with king abdullah of jordan and the president of egypt president sisi and all others who recognize this ideology of death that must be extinguished  we will also work very closely with nato on this new mission i had previously said that nato was obsolete because it failed to deal adequately with terrorism since my comments they have changed their policy and now have a new division focused on terror threats very good very very good i also believe that we could find common ground with russia in a fight against isis wouldnt that be a good thing wouldnt that be a good thing  they too have much at stake in the outcome in syria and have had their own battles with islamic terrorism just as bad as ours they have a big big problem in russia with isis my administration will aggressively pursue joint and coalition military operations to crush and destroy isis international cooperation to cut off their funding expanded intelligence sharing and cyber warfare to disrupt  and disable their propaganda and recruiting their recruiting is taking place right now and theyre setting records its got to be stopped  we cannot allow the internet to be used as a recruiting tool and for other purposes by our enemy we must shut down their access to this form of communication and we must do it immediately  immediately  unlike hilary clinton who has risked so many lives with her carless of handling of sensitive information my administration will not telegram exactly military plans and what they are  and by the way whats happened with her  emails is an absolute disgrace to the united states of america  ive often said that the great general douglas macarthur and the great general george patton would be in a state of shock if they were alive today to see the way president obama and hillary clinton tried to recklessly announce their every move before it happens like they did in iraq so that the enemy can prepare and adapt their enemy says thank you the fight will not be limited to isis we will decimate al qaeda and we will seek to starve funding for iranbacked hamas and hezbollah so important we can use existing un security council resolutions to apply new and even stronger sanctions military cyber and financial warfare will all be necessary to dismantle islamic terrorism but we must use ideological warfare as well very important and they use it on us better than we have ever even thought of using it on them but that will change just as we won just as we won the cold war in part by exposing the evils of communism and the virtues of free markets so too must we take on the ideology of radical islam while my opponent accepted millions of dollars in foundation donations from countries where being gay is an offense punishable by prison or death my administration will speak out against the oppression of women gays and people of different beliefs  our administration would be a friend to all moderate muslim reformers in the middle east and will amplify their voices this includes speaking out against the horrible practice of honor killings where women are murdered by their relatives for dressing marrying or acting in a way that violates fundamentalist teachings over  pakistani girls are estimated to be the victims of honor killings by their relatives each year recently a prominent pakistani social media star was strangled to death by her brother on the charge of dishonoring the family in his confession the brother took pride in the murder and said  girls are born to stay home and follow traditions shockingly this is a tradition that has reached our own shores on such cases and many many cases have happened  where one involves an iraqi immigrant who was sentenced to  years in jail for running over his own daughter claiming she had been too westernized to defeat islamic terrorism we must also speak our forcefully against a hateful ideology that provides the breeding ground for violence and terrorism to grow its a breeding ground its a terrible terrible breeding ground a new immigration policy is needed immediately and as well  the common thread linking the major islamic terror attacks that have recently occurred on our soil   the fort hood shooting the boston bombing the san bernardino attack the orlando attack  is that they have involved immigrants or the children of immigrants clearly new screening procedures are needed a review by the us senate immigration subcommittee has identified  foreignborn individuals charged with terrorism or terrorismrelated offenses between  and  and many more since then and this year is a record for identification its gotten worse far worse we also know that isis recruits refugees after their entrance into the country as we have seen with the somali refugee population in minnesota beyond terrorism as we have also seen in france foreign populations have brought their antisemitic attitudes with them in cologne germany on new years we have seen the reports of sexual violence and assault far greater than anybody knows pew polling shows that in many of the countries from which we draw large number of immigrants  extreme views about religion such death penalty  and for those who are involved  the death penalty is very very common if you dont have the faith that they demand you have a trump administration will establish a clear principle that will govern all decisions pertaining to immigration and we will be tough we will be even extreme  we should only admit into this country those who share our values and respect our people in the cold war we had an ideological screening test the time is overdue to develop a new screening test for the threats we face today i call it extreme vetting i call it extreme extreme vetting our country has enough problems we dont need more these are problems like we have never had before  in addition to scrape out all members of the sympathizers of terrorist groups we must also screen out any hostile attitude towards our country or its principles or who believed sharia law should supplant american law  those who did not believe in our constitution or who support bigotry and hatred will not be admitted for immigration into our country  only those who we expect to flourish in our country and to embrace a tolerant american society should be issued visas  to put these new procedures in place we will have to temporarily suspend immigration from some of the most dangerous and volatile regions of the world that have a history of exporting terrorism not for us not for us    thank you as soon as i take office i will ask the state department and the department of homeland security to identify a list of regions where inadequate screening cannot take place there are many such regions we will stop processing visas from those area until such time as it is deemed safe to resume based on new circumstances or new procedures the size of current immigration flows are too large to perform adequate screening we admit about  permanent immigrants from the middle east every year beyond that we admit hundreds of thousands of temporary workers and visitors from the same regions hundreds of thousands if we dont control the numbers we cant perform adequate screening theres no way it can take place by contrast my opponent wants to increase  which is unbelievable no matter who you are no matter where you come from  wants to increase the flow of syrian refugees by  percent over what they are now the united states subcommittee on immigration estimates that hillary clintons plan would mean roughly  refugees from all current refugeesending nations in her first term assuming no cuts to other refugee programs so it could get worse this would be additional to all other nonrefugee immigration unbelievable numbers unbelievable numbers the subcommittee estimates her plan would impose a lifetime cost of roughly  billion when you include the cost of healthcare welfare housing schooling and all other entitlement benefits that are excluded from the state departments placement figures think of this four hundred billion dollars in short hillary clinton wants to be americas angela merkel and you know what a disaster this massive immigration has been to germany and the people of germany crime has risen to levels that no one thought they would ever ever see it is a catastrophe we have enough problems in our country we dont need more lastly we will need to restore common sense to our security procedures another common feature of the past attacks that have occurred on our soil is that warning signs were totally ignored the  hijackers had fraud all over their visa applications almost every one of them it said practically in big bold letters fraud and nobody saw it the russians warned us about the boston bombers here on political asylum and the attackers were even twice interviewed by the fbi very sad the female san bernardino shooter on her  her statements and everything that she said she was here on a fiance visa which most people have never even heard of from saudi arabia and she wanted to support very openly jihad online these are the people were taking in a neighbor saw suspicious behavior bombs on the floor and other things but didnt warn authorities because they said they didnt want to be accused of racial profiling now many are dead and many more are gravely wounded the shooter in orlando reportedly celebrated in his classroom after  he too was interviewed by the fbi his father a native of afghanistan supported the oppressive taliban regime and expressed antiamerican views very strongly and by the way was just seen sitting behind hillary clinton with a big fat smile on his face all the way through her speech he obviously liked what she had to say its called weakness weakness its called stupidity and weve had it  the fort hood shooter delivered a presentation to a room full of mental health experts before the attacks in which he threw out one red flag after another he even proclaimed that we love death more than you love life not good these warning signs were ignored because political correctness has replaced common sense in our society   thank you that is why one of my first acts as president will be to establish a commission on radical islam which will include reformist voices in the muslim community who will hopefully work with us we want to build bridges and erase divisions the goal of the commission will be to identify and explain to the american public the core convictions and beliefs of radical islam to identify the warning signs of radicalization and to expose the networks in our society that support radicalization this commission will be used to develop new protocols for local police officers federal investigators and immigration screeners and while im at it we should give a hand to our great police officers and law enforcement officials   thank you we will also keep open guantanamo bay and place a renewed emphasis on human intelligence drone strikes will remain part of our strategy but we will also seek to capture high value targets to gain needed information to dismantle their organizations foreign combatants will be tried in military commissions finally we will pursue aggressive criminal or immigration charges against anyone who lends material support to terrorism there will be consequences for those people there will be very serious consequences similar to the effort to take down the mafia this will be the understood mission of every federal investigator and prosecutor in the country to accomplish a goal you must state a mission the support networks for radical islam in this country will be stripped out and removed one by one viciously if necessary viciously if necessary immigration offices will also have their powers restored those  its been taken away those who are guests in our country that are preaching hate will be asked to return home immediately and if they dont do it we will return them home  to make america safe again we must work together again our victory in the cold war relied on a bipartisan and international consensus that is what we must have to defeat radical islamic terrorism but just like we couldnt defeat communism without acknowledging that communism exists or explaining its horrible evils we cant defeat radical islamic terrorism unless we do the exact same thing we have to explain that it exists and explain the difficulties we have to have a leader that can do that and we dont have that now but this also means that we have to promote the exceptional virtues of our own way of life we have an exceptional country and exceptional way of life but its being tread on by sick sick people and expecting that as newcomers come into our society they will likewise have respect and do the same pride in our institutions our history and our values should be taught by parents and teachers and impressed upon all of those who come into our society and want to join our society assimilation is not an act of hostility but an expression of compassion our system of government and our american culture is the best in the world and will produce the best outcomes for all who adopt them   thank you this approach will not only make us safer but bring us closer together as a country renewing the spirit of americanism will help heal the divisions in our country of which there are so many we have a divider as president we call him the great divider its the thing he does best  he will do so by emphasizing what we have in common not what pulls us apart this is my pledge to the american people as your president i will be your single greatest champion i will fight to ensure that every american is treated equally protected equally and honored equally  we will reject bigotry and hatred and oppression in all of its many ugly forms and seek a new future built on our common culture and values as one american people only this way will we make america great again and safe again for everyone thank you very much god bless you thank you thank you thank you very much"
50,"Trump","thank you thank you everybody  thank you what a group wow beautiful thank you  thank you everybody thank you its great to be here tonight  im honored also to be joined this evening by governor scott walker a great gentleman and a really great governor chairman reince priebus and mayor rudolph giuliani  were at a decisive moment in this election last week i laid out my plan to bring jobs back to our country desperately needed jobs yesterday i laid out my plan to defeat radical islamic terrorism  tonight im going to talk about how to make our communities safe again from crime and lawlessness let me begin by thanking law enforcement officers here in this city and across this country for their service and sacrifice in difficult difficult difficult times  the violence riots and destruction that have taken place in milwaukee is an assault on the right of all citizens to live in security and to live in peace  law and order must be restored  it must be restored for the sake of all but most especially for the sake of those living in the affected communities of which there are many the main victims of these riots are lawabiding african american citizens living in these neighborhoods its their job its their homes its their schools and communities which will suffer the most as a result theres no compassion in tolerating lawless conduct for anyone  crime and violence is an attack on the poor and will never be accepted in a trump administration  the narrative has been pushed aggressively for years and now by our current administration and pushed by my opponent hillary clinton you know is a totally false one  you know that the problem in our poorest communities is not that there are too many police the problem is that there are not enough police  more law enforcement more community engagement more effective policing is what our country needs desperately just like hillary clinton is against the miners she is against the police believe me you know it and i know it and guess what she knows it those pedaling the narrative of cops as a racist force in our society a narrative supported with a nod by my opponent shared directly in the responsibility for the unrest in milwaukee and many other places within our country  they have fostered the dangerous antipolice atmosphere in america and all throughout america every time we rush to judgment with false facts and narratives whether in ferguson or in baltimore and foment further unrest we do a direct disservice to poor african american residents who are hurt by the high crime in their community a big big unfair problem during the last  hours while protesters have raged against the police here in milwaukee another nine were killed in chicago and another  were wounded more than  people have been shot in chicago since the beginning of the year and almost  people killed in president obamas hometown area since his presidency began not too good thats for sure  so how are we serving these american victims by attacking law enforcement officers the war on our police must end and it must end now    thank you the war on police is a war on all peaceful citizens who want to be able to work and live and send their kids to school in safety our job is not to make life more comfortable for the rioter or the robber or the looter or the violent disrupter of which there are many our job is to make life more comfortable for the africanamerican parent who wants their kids to be able to safely  safely  walk the streets and walk to school or the senior citizen waiting for a bus or the young child walking home from school for every one violent protester there are a hundred moms and dads and kids on the same city block who just want to be able to sleep safely at night they want safety  my opponent hillary would rather protect the offender than the victim a big problem in our society hillary clintonbacked policies are responsible for the problems in the inner cities today and a vote for her is a vote for another generation of poverty high crime and lost opportunities i care too much about my country to let this happen    thank you the fact is we all care too much about our country to let this happen good policing saves lives my wonderful friend who you just heard rudy giuliani knows a thing or two about this hes done an amazing job the policies put into place by rudy ultimately brought down crime by  percent and murder by  percent in new york  think of how many families were saved how much heartache was prevented when police were put into communities and criminals were automatically and systematically removed imagine how many lives could have been saved all across this country if democratic politicians hadnt blocked in their cities what rudy did in new york city ill make sure we deliver safe neighborhoods here in milwaukee and milwaukee has got so many problems so many problems the world is watching right here in milwaukee but also across the country its easy for hillary clinton to turn a blind eye to crime when she has her own private security force that by the way carries guns  second amendment  i believe all americans not just the powerful are entitled to security hillary clinton has had her chance shes failed at so many things almost everything shes done now its time for new leadership the hillary clinton agenda hurts poor people by far the most there is no compassion in allowing drug dealers gang members and felons to prey on innocent people  it is the first duty of government to keep the innocent safe and when im president i will fight for the safety of every american and especially those americans who have not known safety for a very very long time  im asking for the vote of every africanamerican citizen struggling in our country today who wants a different and much better future  its time for our society to address some honest and very very difficult terms  the democratic party has failed and betrayed the africanamerican community democratic crime policies education policies and economic policies have produced only more crime more broken homes and more poverty  thank you let us look at the situation right here in milwaukee a city run by democrats for decade after decade last year killings in this city increased by  percent plus another  victims of nonfatal shootings  to yearolds accounted for nearly half of the homicide victims the poverty rate here is nearly double the national average almost four in  africanamerican men in milwaukee between the ages of  and  do not have a job nearly four in  singlemother households are living in poverty fiftyfive public schools in this city have been rated as failing to meet expectations despite  in funding per pupil which is a very very high number theres only a  percent graduation rate and its one of the worst public school systems anywhere in the country one in five manufacturing jobs has disappeared in milwaukee since we fully opened our markets and you understand what that means we opened these markets to china and many africanamerican neighborhoods look they have suffered we opened our markets theyve taken our jobs they give us our products that we dont make anymore and africanamerican neighborhoods along with many other neighborhoods have suffered greatly to every voter in milwaukee to every voter living in the inner city or every forgotten stretch of our society im running to offer you a much better future a much better job   at a much higher wage   thank you thank you the democratic party has taken the votes of africanamericans for granted theyve just assumed theyll get your support and done nothing in return for it theyve taken advantage of the african american citizen its time to give the democrats some competition for these votes and its time to rebuild the inner cities of america and to reject the failed leadership of a rigged political system and thats what it is its a rigged system  im not part of the corrupt system in fact the corrupt system is trying to stop me ive been paying my own way tens of millions of dollars tens of millions of dollars the voters in the republican party this year defied the donors the consultants the power brokers and chose a nominee from outside our failed and corrupt broken system the nominee is me  the other party the democratic party nominated the personification of specialinterest corruption the democratic party rigged the nomination to give it to hillary clinton thus giving the soul of their party this year to special interests what else is new im running to listen to your voice to hear the cries for help from so many people in our nation the quiet voices in our society not the loudest demonstrators need to have their demands heard  jobs safety opportunity fair and equal representation  we reject the bigotry of hillary clinton which panders to and talks down to communities of color and sees them only as a votes thats all they care about not as individual human beings worthy of a better future they have taken advantage  she doesnt care at all about the hurting people of this country or the suffering she has caused them and she meaning she and her party officials there has been tremendous suffering because of what they have brought the africanamerican community has been taken for granted for decades by the democratic party and look how theyre doing its time to break with the failures of the past i want to offer americans a new and much better future its time for rule by the people not rule for the special interests which we have right now  thank you every insider getting rich off our broken system and it is broken is throwing money at hillary rodham clinton  the hedge fund managers the wall street investors the professional political class its the powerful protecting only the powerful they dont care about you believe me insiders fighting for insiders but im fighting for you thats what im doing  when we talk about the insider who are we talking about its the comfortable politicians looking out for their own interests its the lobbyists who know how to insert that perfect loophole into every single bill and get richer and richer and richer at your expense its the financial industry that knows how to regulate their competition right out of existence so there is no competition the insiders also include the media executives anchors and journalists in washington los angeles and new york city who are part of the same failed status quo and want nothing to change they dont want it to change they like it just fine the way it is now every day you pick up a newspaper or turn on the nightly news and you hear about some selfinterest banker or some selfdiscredited washington insider say they oppose donald trumps campaign but you dont oppose it that i can tell you you dont oppose it   thank you thank you thank you thank you very much a great honor its a great honor and you have three times as many people standing outside trying to get in so i just want to tell you thank you amazing  or some encrusted old politician says they oppose our campaign or some bigtime lobbyist says they oppose the campaign of trump i wear their opposition as a badge of honor   because it means im fighting for real change not just partisan change where everybody else gets rich but you a rigged rigged system remember it i said it first ill probably be saying it for a long time but eventually were going to break that system  im fighting all of us across the country are fighting for a peaceful regime change in our country the mediadonorpolitical complex thats bled this country dry has to be replaced with a new government of by and for the people  the leadership class in washington dc of which hillary clinton has been a member for  years has abandoned the people of this country they care about themselves they only care about themselves i am going to give the people their voice back  think about it the people opposing our campaign are the same people who have left our border open and let innocent people suffer as a result including vast amounts of crime vast amounts of drugs pouring into our country and poisoning our youth and our people the people opposing our campaign are the same people who have led us into one disastrous foreign war after another one after another no wins no victory no nothing the people opposing our campaign are the same people who lie to us about one trade deal after another they keep getting worse arent you tired of a system that gets rich at your expense because thats whats happening  arent you tired of big media big businesses and big donors rigging the system to keep your voice from being heard  are you ready for change  are you ready for leadership that puts you the american people first together first  that puts our country first america first remember that america first america first america first   lets talk about what this means for the inner cities of america a big big problem unsolved forever its time to break through the television noise the entrenched interests which are just decimating our country and our inner cities i understand that a lot of powerful people are in our political system a lot of people whove created our problems will lose a lot of their contracts and a lot of their money if africanamerican voters and all the minority voters support my campaign that i know that i know for sure its time to stop making the special interests rich its time to make the american people much richer than theyve ever been before  im going to make america wealthy again we have to make america wealthy again if were going to do what we want to do we have to be smart we have to make america wealthy again the democratic party has run nearly every inner city in this country for  years and run them into financial ruin virtually every single one theyve ruined the schools theyve driven out the jobs theyve tolerated a level of crime no american should consider acceptable worse than many thirdworld countries so bad that people dont want to even report on it the real numbers are beyond belief violent crime has risen  percent in americas  largest cities last year killings of police officers this year is up nearly  percent homicides are up more than  percent in baltimore alone theyre up more than  percent in washington dc this is the future offered by the policies of hillary clinton and her friends more poverty more crime and basically just more of the same  the future she offers is the most pessimistic thing i could possibly imagine its time for a different future here is what im proposing first on immigration no community in this country has been hurt worse by hillary clintons immigration and all of her policies than the africanamerican community and she considers them a guaranteed vote now she is proposing to print instant work permits for millions of illegal immigrants to come in and take everybodys job including lowincome africanamericans not right not going to happen  i will secure our border protect our workers and improve our jobs and wages in your community were going to improve our wages were going to improve our jobs and were not going to let companies leave our country so quickly and so easily for other lands and then take their products and sell it to us not going to happen  we will only invite people to join our country who share our tolerant values who support our constitution and who love all of our people they love our people they have to love our country or what are we doing  on trade im going to renegotiate nafta one of the worst trade deals ever signed in the history of our country perhaps the worst ever signed in the history frankly of the world were going to stand up to china withdraw from tpp which is another disaster and protect every last american job we are going to protect every last american job which were not doing now  on taxes im going to give a massive tax cut to every worker and small business in this country bring thousands of new companies and millions of new jobs onto our shores and make it very difficult for our businesses to leave it will be a costly proposition for them to fire everybody and leave  im going to reform our regulations so jobs stay in america and new businesses come to america to hire workers even right here in milwaukee  every policy my opponent has sends jobs outside of the country and overseas im going to bring trillions in new wealth back into the united states our education believe me you look at our education its time to have school choice merit pay for teachers and to end the tenure policies that hurt good teachers and reward bad teachers  and there is no job more important than a good teacher please remember that there is no job more important  we are going to put students and parents first hillary clinton would rather deny opportunities to millions of young africanamerican children just so she can curry favor with the education bureaucracy which is very big and a lot of votes i am going to allow charter schools to thrive and help young kids get on the american ladder of success a good education and a good paying job thats what they want  on crime i am going to support more police in our communities appoint the best prosecutors and judges in the country pursue strong enforcement of federal laws and im going to break up the gangs the cartels and the criminal syndicates terrorizing our neighborhoods all over the country and that includes milwaukee  to every lawbreaker hurting innocent people in this country i say your free reign will soon come crashing to an end  on health care were going to get rid of obamacare repeal it and replace it  its caused soaring doubledigit premium increases and were going to give choice to patients and to consumers across our land aetna just today announced that they are dropping out as are many of the major insurance companies obamacare is a disaster its a disaster on government corruption im going to restore honor to our government weve seen the corruption of hillary clinton the mass e mail  look at whats going on folks look at whats going on  the mass email deletions have you see the  deletions the payforplay at the state department the profiteering the favors given to foreign corporations and governments at your expense and taxpayers expense and its not acceptable any longer its corrupt  weve seen a former secretary of state lie to congress about her illegal email scheme risk innocent american lives and bring dishonor onto our government great great dishonor in my administration im going to enforce all laws concerning the protection of classified information those laws are already protected we thought but perhaps everybody is wrong perhaps all of those that have served jail time were wrong she got special favors and nobody has ever seen anything like it in the history of our country no one will be above the law i am going to forbid senior officials from trading favors for cash by preventing them from collecting lavish speaking fees through their spouses when they serve  i am going to ask my senior officials to sign an agreement not to accept speaking fees from corporations with a registered lobbyist for five years after leaving office or from any entity tied to a foreign government whats happening is disgraceful  this is all just the beginning we are going to make this a government of the people once again this is our chance this is it this is it your last chance this is our chance to take back power from all the people whove taken it from you over so many years the reason you see the establishment and the establishment media lining up behind my opponent is because they are scared that you with your vote can take away their power and return it to your family and to your community  and they are scared and they have no idea how many people on november th are going to come out and vote    thank you thank you thank you these are tough times but i know we can make america greater than ever before i have absolutely no doubt i have gotten to know the people of this country and ill tell you there are no people like the people i have gotten to know no people  to do this we are going to need a fighter in the white house i will be your fighter believe me i will be your fighter  to defeat crime and radical islamic terrorism in our country to win trade in our country you need tremendous physical and mental strength and stamina hillary clinton doesnt have that strength or stamina believe me and you know it and they know it and everybody knows it  she cannot win for you most importantly she has very very bad judgment bad judgment on terrorism bad judgment on foreign policy bad judgment on trade the only individuals shes ever delivered for are her donors not the people just the donors ive said it before and ill say it again my opponent asks her supporters to recite a threeword pledge her pledge reads im with her  i choose to recite a totally different pledge my pledge reads im with you the american people    i will fight to ensure that every american is treated equally protected equally and honored equally we will reject bigotry and hatred and oppression in all of its many ugly forms and seek a new future of security prosperity and opportunity a future built on our common culture and values as one american people  i am asking for your vote on november th so i can be your champion in the white house ok ok  i will be your champion i will be your voice in the white house we will bring it back we will once again be a country of law and order  and we will once again be a country of great and unchallenged success  to every parent who dreams for their children and to every child who dreams for their future i say these words to you tonight im with you i will fight for you and i will win for you  together we will make america strong again we will make america safe again and we will make america great again greater than ever before thank you and god bless you thank you thank you thank you"
51,"Trump","absolutely it is and were not taking it uh were not taking it to them and we have to take it to them you know i didnt want to go into iraq i said now hes a civilian so i would say not too many people cared what i wanted to do but that was a terrible mistake our terrible mistake number two was getting out the way we got out president obama hillary clinton the way they got out was absolutely insane it will be talked about for many many years and it really led to the formation of isis uh we have problems in this country were letting thousands and thousands of people come into our country we have no idea who they are where they come from theres no paperwork nobody knows what theyre doing and theyre coming in by the thousands and hillary clinton it was announced recently that she wants to allow  percent more coming into our country from syria from the migration than obama is allowing to come in   so its got   well he actually had a speech and its  its so    its actually    its not only true its sad because i mean how obvious can it be you look at whats going on world trade center you look at san bernardino you look at so many different things you look at nice just recently i have friends they wont go to france anymore they love france they love the  the city of lights paris they love  they love paris and i say to them how was france this summer oh we dont go there anymore france is no longer france and were going to do the same thing to our country sean so we cant allow it to happen and i have as big a heart as anybody we take care of people well build safe zones over in syria well do something we have to have the gulf states pay for it because the gulf states they make nothing but money   a hundred percent   oh  percent   a hundred percent a hundred percent and we have to        right   well look  look i said one thing right from the beginning i wanted to get out we should have never been there and i wanted to get out and ive been  ive been against it ever since i mean you can look back to   uh in fact on neil cavutos show before the war started i said lets not do it we have other things we have to do including fix our economy which was a mess ok to put it mildly but the way we got out was ridiculous but ive been saying something ever since ive known you keep the oil have i said that   keep the oil   keep the oil and  we went through  and i said when we went in you know in the old days to the victor belonged the spoils we  if we  i dont call it a victory its no victory but certainly militarily we wiped them out but i said keep the oil and take the money and some of it give to the families of the soldiers who died give it to the wounded warriors give to the people that have been hurt so badly in that war   and  and it    it  it would be  by the way that would be such a small part of the money and the rest we used to pay ourselves    right so    its  what im saying is keep the oil now if they would have done that there would be no isis i said keep the oil and i  i think most of the audience has heard me say  times i mean every time practically somebody or so  so i wanted to get out but i wanted to keep the oil so by nature that means youre staying in because youre going to have to guard the oil etc etc but that oil is very prized oil believe me we have the same problem in libya right now we did the stupid attacks on libya and we got nothing out of it and isis has taken over the oil and its some of the finest oil in the world   so when i was young and went to school i had always heard we never lost this country we never lost a war you know world war i world war ii we  we just didnt lose wars and since then i mean when you think of it you look at vietnam you look at this mess that were in right now all of the money spent on this i mean its so sad trillions of dollars i used to say  trillion in iraq but that was years ago i mean ive been saying that for so long nobody even knows what it is in the meantime our country is going to hell our infrastructure is terrible our roads our bridges our tunnels our schools our hospitals theyre  were like a third world  were becoming like a third world country were spending our money over there with all of that being said you have an enemy that wants to do serious harm to us ok beyond what anyone has ever seen this is like medieval times   i  i chose not to but you know i  we all understood what took place and these were great young people and not only our people theyre doing it to their own people theyre doing it to christians if youre a christian in the middle east and they have you its very likely thats going to happen the point is they want to do serious harm we have to take them out we have to take them out very very swiftly and viciously if necessary    generals have    right general flynn and other of the generals these are great people and i ask them all the time if you were given your head  because right now theyre fighting a politically correct war if you were given your head just you go and youve got to get them out how long would it take ill tell you what they are    they are telling me they could do the job very very rapidly now very rapidly is longer than you would like but they could get the job done and get it done with precision and get it done uh we have no choice sean we have no choice we have to take them out                 well were just allowing people into our country that some are going to be a problem and we have enough problems in our country right now and you people are really proof positive what youve gone through its unimaginable i watched the boston bombing so many times on television how somebody can do that how they got them on tape it was genius police work how they got them to start off with but you know how they caught him but when you walk  you see them walking along like they havent got a problem in the world and theyre looking to do mass destruction and when i see that i want to do something about it i want to do something about it        sure   sure                              true   true                wow   wow        right and there will be more look we can be nice about it we can say its never going to happen again there will be more and what were doing by allowing thousands and thousands tens of thousands of people in here that we just dont know anything about its going to happen again because theres something wrong and until we figure it out we have to stop it and that was really a large part of the speech that i just  i just      right      well you dont want to do that and    and if they knew about it that would be one thing and i assume they knew about it big league but certainly they know about it now so maybe they can give the money back ive  ive actually called    ive actually called   and you know what lets give them the benefit of the doubt they certainly knew about    and but do you know what  you know what    they should give the money back and ive been saying this for a long time they should give the money back       well you know look uh theres a whole big phony deal going on and i have to say when we were talking about benghazi uh the end i dont know if everybody remembers it i remember it at  in the morning essentially who do you want to be at that phone at  in the morning we have some people    we have some people    oh ill be  hey ill be up i will tell you that   she was    not too effective      you know the amazing thing because that was a big ad and everybody made a big deal and she said shed be there at  she wasnt there but   but  but she had a certain friend    that was contacting her routinely all day and all week and all the time routinely and you had  messages trying to get through different forms of message and not one of those messages got through    well look   right well let me just you you get very smart people and there are those people and theyre very good at understanding whats going on but beyond that you use social media because a lot of these people  i mean theyre better at social media than we are isis if you look at what isis is doing with social theyre recruiting over the internet and i also said we have to end that we have to knock it out we have to  you know some people would say oh thats a terrible thing   we have to end that   but  but sean when you look at whats going on with the internet and how isis is using the internet and what theyre doing and what theyre doing to us and then you have people in our country that say oh you cant do that thats doing something so bad to us here we are people  they want to blow us up we have to be very careful we have to take them out very swiftly because weapons are getting stronger and stronger meaner and meaner and believe me they want to come over here now again i was one that didnt want to go over there but now you have no chance  really you have no choice now one thing when obama announced when hes going out and were going to  all they did is they sat back i couldnt believe it when i was watching i was watching this conference and he was talking about getting out and when they were getting out i  im sitting there i cant believe that he would say it and even hillary clinton when she talks about the different things she wants to  why cant we just be quiet and do the job why cant we be quiet     and do the job   i dont want to telegraph now   no i dont want to tell them   ok so when you look at uh san bernardino right which was a horror show she came in she probably radicalized the husband what a  what a couple that was that was a real beauty   so if they would have looked at social media they would have seen that this woman was trouble   we didnt look at social media they just came in uh they actually killed people that gave them a baby uh a baby shower  a baby party they had a child they  the  people that were killed they were at the party honoring the birth of their baby and then they went in and they shot them all killed them all look theres something going on its a sick deal its beyond just normal   sean    this is a sick sick deal   id throw him out if you look at him id throw him out   you know i looked at him and you look hes smiling   he had the red cap on i thought it was one of my caps i said no no   make america great again i dont think so but he has the red cap hes got a big smile on his face during the whole thing he obviously liked what he heard ok from her look we have to be so tough and so smart and so vigilant and frankly the muslims have to help us because they see whats going on in their community we dont see it they have to help us   and if theyre not going to help us theyre to blame also   but in  in san bernardino they saw bombs laying around the apartment    in the apartment and people saw it and they wanted to be  they called it racial profiling we didnt want to call in because of racial profiling in other words a lawyer got to them and said youve got a problem here you knew this was there say racial profiling but look we have  whether its racial profiling or politically correct wed better get smart we are letting tens of thousands of people into our country we dont know what the hell were doing                      thats  by the way thats a little bit of a different subject but its all   its related a little different but its related               ok   right   paid for by somebody else    doubled it   doubled it   right youd take it    in syria   they have plenty of land that i can tell you but in syria theres plenty of money because you look at the gulf states you like at the kind of money they have theres nobody seen money like that and theyre not doing anything   theyre not doing anything                     paid for by somebody else    doubled it he doubled it    in syria they have plenty of land that i can tell you but in syria and theres plenty of money because you look at the gulf states you look at the kind of money they have theres  nobody has seen money like that and theyre not doing anything theyre not doing anything          everybody   everybody right everybody     i really do mostly but you know a lot of times the mainstream media they put it on like if im talking about anything else theyll put that on she is so protected they are so protecting her she hasnt had a news conference in like  days   well she is being protected by the government definitely i mean how she got away with the emails is beyond anything ive ever seen in justice but i have to say shes being protected and shes being protected by the media when i say something about her for instance if i speak for an hour and i talk about her for a half an hour  minutes nothing gets on television theyll put something else on but they wont   other things get on television    look let me just say shes totally protected ive never seen anything like it   and she doesnt really do that much shell give a speech on teleprompter and then shell disappear i dont know if she goes home  she goes home and goes to sleep i think she sleeps   i guess she takes a lot of weekends off she takes a lot of time off and you know thats frankly  frankly its really not fair   yes right   you never say  percent but im telling you pretty close  percent the wall gets built we need it you know the border patrol   the border patrol agents have endorsed me along with sheriff joe and everyone else    it gets built   we have to rebuild its all depleted the military is depleted   one hundred percent   it could be done faster than that we have regulations that are absolutely destroying our energy companies   yes ive already announced who the  could be i have  people from which to pick and i want to get as close to scalia as i can    you know obamacare is dying of its own volition if you look at the  of obamacare you saw what happened with aetna today its really    one hundred percent im telling you too"
52,"Trump","thank you  thank you thank you very much thank you and its great to be in charlotte  i just met with our many amazing employees right up the road at my property i will tell you they like me very much i guess i pay them a little too much  id like to take a moment to talk about the heartbreak and devastation in louisiana a state that is very very special to me we are one nation when one state hurts we all hurt and we must all work together to lift each other up  working building restoring together our prayers are with the families who have lost loved ones and we send them our deepest condolences through  words cannot express the sadness one feels at times like this i hope everyone in louisiana knows that our country is praying for them and standing with them to help them in these difficult hours they are very very difficult thank you  we are one country one people and we will have together one great fantastic future  together id like to talk about the new american future that we are going to create as a team together last week i laid out my plan to bring jobs back to our country they are vanishing and they are vanishing quickly on monday i laid out my plan to defeat radical islamic terrorism  on tuesday in wisconsin i talked about how were going to restore law and order to this country we need law and order without it we have nothing  let me take this opportunity to extend our thanks and our gratitude to the police and law enforcement officers in this country who have sacrificed so greatly in these very difficult times and they are difficult the chaos and violence on our streets and the assault on law enforcement are really and truly an attack against all peaceful citizens if im elected president this chaos and violence will end and it will end very very quickly  every single citizen in our land has a right to live in safety to be one united nations we must protect all of our people all of our people  but we must also provide opportunities for all of our people we cannot make america great again if we leave any community behind nearly four in  africanamerican children are living in poverty i will not rest until children of every color in this country are fully included in the american dream  jobs safety opportunity is what we have to have and its what we need fair and equal representation this is what i promise to africanamericans hispanics americans and  of all types of all colors of all religions this is what we promise we all promise everybody in this room promises this is what we have to do  but to achieve this new american future we must break from the failures of the past as you know im not a politician  its good ive worked in business created a great company created lot of jobs rebuilding neighborhoods thats what ive done all of my adult life ive never wanted to learn the language of the insiders and ive never been politically correct it takes far too much time  truthfully it takes far too much time and can often make it more difficult to achieve total victory sometimes in the heat of debate and speaking on a multitude of issues you dont choose the right words or you say the wrong thing i have done that   and believe it or not i regret it and i do regret it particularly where it may have caused personal pain too much is at stake for us to be consumed with these issues but one thing  i can promise you this i will always tell you the truth  i speak the truth for all of you and for everyone in this country who doesnt have a voice of which there are many i speak the truth on behalf of the factory worker who lost his or her job and thats happening more and more in our country i speak the truth on behalf of the veteran who has been denied the medical care they need and the medical care they deserve and so many are not making it but theyre going to make it if trump becomes president that i can tell you  they are dying on lines waiting for a doctor we are going to take care of our veterans i speak the truth on behalf of the family living near the border that deserves to be safe in their own country but is instead living with no security and no protection at all    we will build the wall believe me we will build it  our campaign is about representing the great majority of americans republicans democrats independents conservatives and liberals who read the newspaper or turn on the television and dont hear anyone  anyone speaking for them all they hear are insiders fighting for other insiders thats what they do these are the forgotten men and women in our society and they are angry at so much and on so many levels   the poverty the unemployment the failing schools the jobs moving to other countries im fighting for these forgotten americans  fourteen months ago i declared my campaign for the presidency on the promise to give our government back to the people  every day since then ive worked to repay the loyalty and the faith that you have put in me every day i think about how much is at stake for our country in the upcoming election this isnt just the fight of my life its the fight of our lives together to save our country  thank you i refuse to let another generation of american children be excluded from the american dream which is whats happening our whole country loses when young people of limitless potential are denied the opportunity to contribute their talents because we failed to provide them the opportunities that they deserve  let our children be dreamers too  our whole country loses every time a kid doesnt graduate from high school or fails to enter the workforce or worse still is lost to the dreadful world of drugs and crime and so many are so so many when i look at the failing schools the terrible trade deals the infrastructure crumbling in our inner cities i know all of this can be fixed and i can fix it but i know it can be fixed very very quickly if we know what were doing  in the world i come from if something is broken you fix it if something isnt working you replace it if a product doesnt deliver you make a change i have no patience for injustice no tolerance for government incompetence  and thats what it is is gross incompetence   and no sympathy for leaders who fail their citizens thats why i am running to end the decades of bitter failure and to offer the american people a new future of honesty justice and opportunity   a future where america and its people always  and i mean always  comes first america first remember america first america first    arent you tired of a system that gets rich and this is a system which is getting very rich at your expense thats whats happening arent you tired of the same old lies and the same old broken promises and hillary clinton has proven to be one of the greatest liars of all time  arent you tired of arrogant leaders who look down on you instead of serving and protecting you and thats whats happening that is all about to change and its about to change very very soon how about november th  we are going to put the american people first again ive traveled all across this country laying out my bold and modern agenda for change in this journey i will never lie to you i will never tell you something i do not believe i will never put anyones interests ahead of yours   and i will never ever stop fighting for you  i have no special interests controlling me and i have no special interests im spending millions and millions of dollars on my own campaign im funding my campaign  my only interest is the american people my interest  this country has been so good to me im giving back and thats what its all about giving back  so while sometimes i can be too honest hillary clinton is the exact opposite she never tells the truth one lie after another and getting worse with each passing day   thank you the american people are still waiting for hillary clinton to apologize for all of the many lies shes told to them and the many times she has betrayed the american people at great danger to them  tell me has hillary ever apologized for lying about her illegal email server and deleting  emails   has hillary clinton apologized for turning the state department into a payforplay operation where favors are sold to the highest bidder which is exactly whats happening   has she apologized for lying to the families who lost loved ones at benghazi   has she apologized for putting iran on a path to nuclear weapons   has she apologized for iraq for libya for syria   has she apologized for unleashing isis across the world she and barack obama unleashed isis whether you like it or dont like it whether you want to hear it or dont thats what happened  has hillary clinton apologized for the decisions she made that have led to so much death destruction and terrorism   speaking of lies we now know from the state department just announced that president obama lied about the  million in cash   that was flown to iran it was flown to iran  million in cash he denied it was for the hostages but it was just came out he said we dont pay ransom but we did he lied about the hostages openly and blatantly just like he lied about obamacare  you remember you can have your doctor you can have your plan right you can have your doctor you can have your plan didnt work out that way now the administration has put every american traveling overseas including our military personnel at greater risk of being kidnapped hillary clinton owns president obamas iran policy one more reason she can never ever be allowed to be president  lets talk about the economy here in this beautiful and great state so many people have suffered because of nafta nafta remember nafta what its done to this country bill clinton signed the deal and hillary clinton supported the deal north carolina has lost nearly half of its manufacturing jobs since nafta went into effect bill clinton also put china into the world trade organization another hillary clintonbacked disaster your city of charlotte has lost one in four manufacturing jobs since china joined the wto and many of these jobs were lost while hillary clinton was secretary of state our chief diplomat with china she was a disaster totally unfit for this job totally unfit  hillary clinton owes the state of north carolina a very big apology and i think youll get that apology around the same time youll get to see her  deleted emails  in another words youll never see the apology another major issue in this campaign has been the border our open border has allowed drugs and crime and gangs to pour into our country and our communities so much needless suffering so much preventable death ive spent time with the families of wonderful americans whose loved ones were killed by the open borders and sanctuary cities that hillary clinton supports  ive embraced crying parents whove lost their children to violence spilling across our border parents like laura wilkerson and michelle root and sabin durden and my friend jamiel shaw whose children were killed by illegal immigrants so needlessly my opponent supports sanctuary cities  but where were these sanctuaries for kate steinle where were they where were they  where was it where was the sanctuary for kate think about it where was the sanctuary for the children of laura and michelle and sabin and jamiel where was the sanctuary for every other parent who has suffered so horribly these moms and dads dont get a lot of consideration from our politicians they certainly dont get apologies theyll never even get the time of day from hillary clinton she doesnt even care im convinced but they will always come first to me  listen closely we will deliver justice for all of these great american families  we will create a system of immigration that makes us all proud hillary clintons mistakes destroy innocent lives sacrifice national security and betray the working families of this country please remember this i will never put personal profit before national security nobody should  i will never leave our border open to appease donors and special interests which is what hillary is doing and they are being appeased  i will never support a trade deal that kills american jobs  i will never ever put the special interests before the national interests  i will never put a donor before a voter or a lobbyist before a citizen  instead i will be a champion for the people the establishment media doesnt cover what really matters in this country or whats really going on in peoples lives they will take words of mine out of context and spend a week obsessing over every single syllable and then pretend to discover some hidden meaning in what i said  just imagine for a second if the media spent this energy holding the politicians accountable who got innocent americans like kate steinle killed she was gunned down by an illegal immigrant who had been deported five times just imagine if the media spent time  and lots of time  investigating the poverty and joblessness of the inner cities just think about how much different things would be if the media in this country sent their cameras to our border to our closing factories or to our failing schools   or if the media focused on what dark secrets must be hidden in the  emails that hillary clinton illegally deleted   thank you instead every story is told from the perspective of the insider its the narrative of the people who rig the system never the voice of the people its been rigged against believe me so many people suffering for so long in silence no cameras no coverage no outrage from the media class that seems to get outraged over just about everything else so again its not about me its never been about me its been about all the people in this country who dont have a voice i am running to be your voice    thank you i am running to be the voice for every forgotten part of this country that has been waiting and hoping for a better future  i am glad that i make the powerful  and i mean very powerful  a little uncomfortable now and again including some of the powerful people frankly in my own party  because it means that im fighting for real change  real change  theres a reason hedge fund managers the financial lobbyists the wall street investors are throwing their money all over hillary clinton because they know she will make sure the system stays rigged in their favor its the powerful protecting the powerful the insiders fighting for the insiders i am fighting for you  here is the change i propose on terrorism we are going to end the era of nationbuilding and instead focus on destroying destroying destroying isis and radical islamic terrorism  we will use military cyber and financial warfare and work with any partner in the world and the middle east that shares our goal of defeating terrorism i have a message for the terrorists trying to kill our citizens we will find you we will destroy you and we will absolutely win and we will win soon  on immigration we will temporarily suspend immigration from anyplace where adequate screening cannot be performed extreme vetting  remember extreme vetting all applicants for immigration will be vetted for ties to radical ideology and we will screen out anyone who doesnt share our values and love our people    anyone who believes sharia law supplants american law will not be given an immigrant visa  if you want to join our society then you must embrace our society our values and our tolerant way of life  those who believe in oppressing women gays hispanics african americans and people of different faiths are not welcome to join our great country  we will promote our american values our american way of life and our american system of government which are all  all  the best in the world  my opponent on the other hand wants a  percent increase in syrian refugees even more than already pouring into our country under president obama  her plan would bring in roughly  refugees from all refugeesending nations in her first term alone on top of all other immigration think of that think of that what are we doing hillary clinton is running to be americas angela merkel   and weve seen how much crime and how many problems thats caused the german people and germany we have enough problems already we do not need more on crime were going to add more police more investigators and appoint the best judges and prosecutors in the world  we will pursue strong enforcement of federal laws the gangs and cartels and criminal syndicates terrorizing our people will be stripped apart one by one and theyll be sent out of our country quickly  their day is over and its going to end very very fast our trade  thank you on trade were going to renegotiate nafta to make it better and if they dont agree we will withdraw   and likewise were going to withdraw from the trans pacific partnership another disaster  stand up to china on our terrible trade agreements and protect every last american job hillary clinton has supported all of the major trade deals that have stripped this country of its jobs and its wealth we owe  trillion on taxes we are going to massively cut tax rates for workers and small businesses creating millions of new good paying jobs  were going to get rid of regulations that send jobs overseas and we are going to make it easier for young americans to get the credit they need to start a small business and pursue their dream  on education so important we are going to give students choice and allow charter schools to thrive we are going to end tenure policies that reward bad teachers and hurt our great good teachers my opponent wants to deny students choice and opportunity all to get a little bit more money from the education bureaucracy she doesnt care how many young dreams are dashed or destroyed and theyre destroyed young people are destroyed before they even start we are going to work closely with african american parents and children we are going to work with the parent students we are going to work with everybody in the african american community in the inner cities and what a big difference that is going to make its one of the things i most look forward to doing  this means a lot to me and its going to be a top priority in a trump administration on health care we are going to repeal and replace the disaster called obamacare  countless americans have been forced into parttime jobs premiums are about to jump by double digits yet again and just this week aetna announced it is pulling out of the exchanges all over but also in north carolina we are going to replace this disaster with reforms that give you choice and freedom and control in health care at a much much lower cost youll have much better health care at a much lower cost and it will happen quickly  on political corruption we are going to restore honor to our government in my administration im going to enforce all laws concerning the protection of classified information  no one will be above the law i am going to forbid senior officials from trading favors for cash by preventing them from collecting lavish speaking fees through their spouses when they serve  im going to ask my senior officials to sign an agreement not to accept speaking fees from corporations with a registered lobbyist for five years after leaving office or from any entity tied to a foreign government  finally we are going to bring our country together it is so divided we are going to bring it together we are going to do it by emphasizing what we all have in common as americans were going to reject bigotry and i will tell you the bigotry of hillary clinton is amazing she sees communities of color only as votes and not as human beings worthy of a better future  its only votes  it is only votes that she sees and she does nothing about it shes been there forever and look at where you are if african american voters give donald trump a chance by giving me their vote the result for them will be amazing  look how badly things are going under decades of democratic leadership look at the schools look at the poverty look at the  percent of young african americans not working   percent it is time for a change   what do you have to lose by trying something new i will fix it  watch i will fix it you have nothing to lose  nothing to lose  it is so bad the inner cities are so bad you have nothing to lose they have been playing with you for    years  many many decades you have nothing to lose i will do a great job   this means so much to me and i will work as hard as i can to bring new opportunity to places in our country which have known it in a very very long time hillary clinton and the democratic party have taken african american votes totally for granted because the votes have been automatically there for them there has been no reason for democrats to produce and they havent they havent produced in decades and decades its time to break with the failures of the past and to fight for every last american child in this country to have a better and a much much brighter future  in my administration every american will be treated equally protected equally and honored equally we will reject bigotry and hatred and oppression in all of its forms and seek a new future built on our common culture and values as one american people  this is the change i am promising to all of you an honest government a great economy and a just society for each and every american  but we can never ever fix our problems by relying on the same politicians who created these problems in the first place  cant do it    percent of voters say our country is on the wrong track i am the change candidate hillary clinton is for the failed status quo to protect her special interests her donors her lobbyists and others it is time to vote for a new american future together we will make america strong again  we will make america proud again we will make america safe again   friends and fellow citizens come november we will make america great again  greater than ever before  thank you thank you and god bless you thank you  thank you very much"
53,"Trump","thank you very much thank you thank you what a crowd wow look at that boy what a crowd  thank you thank you very much thank you we just set a record in this building folks so thats good news thats fantastic thank you  i love michigan and i must tell you come november to be specific november th with your help we are going to win and we are going to win big  and wish going to the white house and we are going to bring jobs back to our country and we are going to bring jobs back to michigan  its going to be a victory for the people a victory for the wageearner the factory worker remember this a big big victory for the factory worker they havent had those victories for a long time a victory for every citizen and for all of the people whose voices have not been heard for many many years theyre going to be heard again  itll be a win for the voters not for the pundits not for the journalists not for the lobbyists not for the global special interests funding my opponents campaign  its going to be your victory  these are hard times for many in this country i just got back from a tour of the suffering and devastation in louisiana perhaps you can tell by the way im dressed just got off the plane it was actually incredible the spirit of the people is incredible the devastation likewise theyve never seen anything like it but the spirit of the people is incredible and honestly obama ought to get off the golf course and get down there  we mourn for the lives lost and we pledge our help comfort and support to every last person in need to the people of louisiana we are with you and we will always be with you  in my vision i saw not only the suffering of our people but also their strength courage and really unbeatable spirit their spirit will overcome we have a lot to overcome in our country especially the fact that our jobs are being taken away from us and going to other lands and were not going to allow it to happen and especially its happening right here in michigan  its an amazing spirit that we will need to rebuild our country its that strength that were going to need to create the new american future our children so much deserve  in this new  thank you thank you very much in this new future millions of workers on the sidelines will be returned to the work force and if im not elected president that will never happen believe me theyre talking to you theyre playing you but believe me you know the answer and i have to say that ive been talking about michigan and the car industry and how your businesses and plants have been ripped out of your land and i have been doing it for four years to the people of michigan other people started talking about it last week theyre not going to do anything about it crumbling roads bridges and airports we will replaced with the infrastructure our country needs and deserves  families strapped in welfare will be provided with jobs and opportunity children stuck in failing government schools will be able to attend the school of their choice  government will become lean effective responsible and honest  our boarder will be protected and our children will be safe very very safe  and we will build the wall dont worry about it we will build the wall    law and order will be restored and the poorest places in our country will know safety and peace again  american values and cultures will be cherished  and i mean cherished and celebrated once again but to achieve this new american future we must break free from the bitter failures of the past and reject the same insiders telling us the same old lies and over again and over again and over again  no group in america has been more harmed by hillary clintons policies than africanamericans no group no group if hillary clintons goal was to inflict pain to the africanamerican community she could not have done a better job it is a disgrace  tonight im asking for the vote of every single africanamerican citizen in this country who wants to see a better future  the inner cities of our country have been run by the democratic party for more than  years their policies have produced only poverty joblessness failing schools and broken homes its time to hold democratic politicians accountable for what they have done to these communities at what point do we say enough  at what point do we say enough  it is time to hold failed leaders accountable for their results not just their empty words over and over again look at what the democratic party has done to the city  as an example and there are many others  of detroit  percent of detroits residents  percent live in poverty half of all detroit residents do not work and cannot work and cant get a job detroit tops the list of most dangerous cities in terms of violent crime number one this is the legacy of the democratic politicians who have run this city this is the result of the policy agenda embraced by crooked hillary clinton     emails gone  the only way to change results is to change leadership  we can never fix our problems by relying on the same politicians who created our problems in the first place a new future requires brand new leadership  look at how much africanamerican communities are suffering from democratic control to those i say the follow what do you have to lose by trying something new like trump what do you have to lose    i say it again what do you have to lose look what do you have to lose you live in your poverty your schools are no good you have no jobs  percent of your youth is unemployed what the hell do you have to lose and at the end of four years i guarantee you that i will get over  percent of the africanamerican vote i promise you because i will produce  i will for the innercities and i will produce for the africanamericans and the democrats  the democrats will not produce and all theyve done is taken advantage of your vote thats theyve done and once the elections over they go back to their palaces in washington and you know what they do nothing for you just remember it so you have nothing to lose one thing we know for sure is that if you keep voting for the same people you will keep getting the same exactly the same result my administration will go to work for you as no one has ever done before  we will work we will bring back jobs we will work by contrast the one thing every item in hillary clintons agenda has in common is that it takes jobs and opportunities away from africanamerican workers it takes jobs away from all workers because your companies are leaving michigan your companies are leaving every single state in our union they are going to mexico theyre going everywhere but here hillary clinton supports open borders which means many things but it means people pour in and take your jobs whether you like it or dont like it they take your jobs her fierce opposition to school choice you need choice you have to get your children into good schools you do that through competition you need choice her plan to massively to raise taxes on small business and everyone  trillion increase whereas i am cutting taxes very substantially for business and for the middle class her tremendous opposition to american energy the opposition is fierce and her record of giving our jobs away to many many other countries america must reject the bigotry of hillary clinton who sees communities of color only as votes not as human beings worthy of a better future hillary clinton would rather provide a job to a refugee from overseas than to give that job to unemployed africanamerican youth in cities like detroit who have become refugees in their own country its time to get our country back to work and that includes an allout effort to help young africanamericans get the good paying jobs that they deserve hillary clintons plan would bring in an estimated  refugees in her first term at a lifetime benefit cost of some  billion to our country according to the senate immigration subcommittee  hillary clinton wants to be americas angela merkel by the way for the price of supporting one refugee in the united states we could support  in a safe zone in the middle east or lets say syria the improved refugee screening standards i have proposed will save countless billions of dollars its called extreme vetting extreme vetting  we will invest a portion of the money saved in the jobs program for innercity youth the africanamerican community has given so much to this country they fought and died in every war since the revolution theyve lifted up the conscience of our nation in the long march towards civil rights theyve sacrificed so much for the national good yet nearly four in  africanamerican children still live in poverty and  percent as i said of young africanamericans are not working they cannot find a job we must do better as a country i refuse to believe that the future must be like the past it wont be our future is going to be a great future for everyone for everyone  in a trump administration all workers of all colors will get priority for jobs in their own country which is about time i want higher wages for africanamericans for hispanic americans and for all americans we want higher wages  many many workers in our country are making substantially less money today in real wages than they made  years ago theyre working two jobs instead of one theyre working much harder as they get older and its supposed to be the opposite were going to stop it were going to create great jobs and were going to get the wages up  hillary clinton is a throw back to an ugly past where politicians preyed on our poorest citizens while selling them out for personal gain promises promises all talk no action  all talk no action politicians they talk talk talk you vote them in with great fanfare and then they do nothing with trump thats not going to happen believe me  we must turn the page on yesterday only a change in leadership will produce a change in outcomes and we cant take as a country four more years of obama and thats what you get with hillary clinton but probably worse  in this new american future american workers will always come first america first always come first  this will include a complete revitalization of the michigan manufacturing sector now you have to understand the michigan manufacturing sector is a disaster it is a disaster look at your notes look at your stats look at whats happening to your state youre losing your businesses its like taking candy away from a baby and many people in this audience right now that think you have jobs youre going to find out very soon that your company is leaving for mexico or some other place and youre not going to have your job very long and if trump gets in those days are over folks those days are over  we will be bringing back our jobs to michigan there will be a very big price to pay for those companies that want to leave our land go some place else manufacture their goods and sell them back with no retribution it wont happen there will be consequence  it wont happen it will not happen  michigan lost more than one in four of its manufacturing jobs since nafta as you know nafta one of the worst trade bills in history maybe  maybe the worst trade bill ever signed in the history of the world not only in our country its emptied out michigan it emptied out new england it emptied out new york state it emptied out so many of our great companies they leave and they fire we end up with devastation we end up with unemployment we end up with nothing the bill was signed by bill clinton  it was supported by hillary clinton right here in this community you have lost one in seven manufacturing jobs since bill clinton put china into the world trade organization  another hillary clinton backed deal she backs all the deals and by the way she will be backing the transpacific partnership tpp  if she is elected just mark your words just remember you know its going to happen she considered it the gold standard all of a sudden when she heard me talking about it she said i cant win this one so she went against it shell go back immediately and you saw that when the governor of virginia whose her friend said that was going to happen  detroit lost more than one in three manufacturing jobs following the nafta and wto agreements that were supported very strongly by my opponent no industry has been hurt more by hillary clintons policies than the automobile industry or as we call it the car industry it has been a total disaster   according to the bureau of the labor of statistics before nafta went into effect there was  auto workers in michigan today that number is down to  and it is going to be a lot lower because if you look at the massive plants being built right now in mexico  car plants folks  you can kiss these jobs goodbye  but not me now with me it wont happen  in  general motors announced plans to double its investments in mexico by plans by  not good  in april  ford motor company announced plans to invest another  billion constructing an auto plant in mexico mexico will become the car capital of the world very very quickly and michigan is going to end up with lots of empty buildings all over the place unless you elect donald trump president  in same month fiat  chrysler announced  layoffs the list goes on and on we will turn it around we will turn it around fast we will meet with these companies and we will say it will not be easy for you to move your plant to mexico  for you sell your cars through what will be a very strong border and for you not to pay tax on those cars coming in okay  and when we tell them that there will be a substantial tax on the cars that they make in mexico and other places number one theyre not going to move in the first place and number two if they do our country will make one heck of a lot of money  but to save your jobs and do all of the things that im talking about we have to win on november th   the destruction that nafta started will be finished off if the transpacific partnership is approved it will be almost  nothing is as bad as nafta  but it will be almost as bad as nafta we know from hillarys closest friend she is planning to ram through tpp if shes elected she called it as i said the gold standard its passage would be a disaster for michigan in particular for the car industry in particular for the people of michigan  i wont let it happen   according to the economic policy institute the united states trade deficit with the proposed tpp member countries cost over one million manufacturing jobs in our country in  by far the biggest losses occurred in motor vehicles and parks which lost nearly   think of that   manufacturing jobs michigan ranks first for jobs lost as a share of state workforce due to trade deficit with tpp members just imagine how many more automobile jobs will be lost if hillary gets her wish and approves tpp it will not be pretty thats why i have announced that we will withdrawal from the deal before that deal can ever ever ever happen  i have have previously laid out a detailed sevenpoint plan for trade reform available on my website it includes strong protections against currency manipulation from countries like china and tariffs against any nation that cheats by unfairly subsidizing their goods of which many of them do  my plan also includes a total renegotiation of nafta so our jobs can come back  and if we cant make a much much better deal than we have right now we will walk  im not in any way shape or form an isolationist i dont believe in it but we have to make great deals for our country were losing in our whole trade negotiation with oil  countries over  billion a year thats our trade deficit who negotiates these deals we want great trade deals and we will have them  but we want trade deals that work for america that create jobs and wealth for our country that work for the american worker  we want to shrink our almost  billion trade deficit we dont want to expand it and its been expanding for years for years and years you look at the charts  up up up up up and i say to myself so often why dont they do something about it and the reason is we have political hacks as our negotiators we have politicians as our negotiators we have politicians that are controlled like hillary clinton by her donors her special interests and her lobbyists and they wont let her do whats right for our workers and for our country we want to be leading the world in production exports and manufacturing we want jobs to leave from other countries and come into our country for a change  another major issue in this race is foreign policy hillary clinton has made one bad foreign policy decision after another beginning with the support for going to war in iraq and i opposed it so strongly nobody cared i was a civilian but i opposed it i said you will have a total destabilization of the middle east it was such common sense and look what happened her tenure as secretary of state may be regarded as the most disastrous in united states history  but she is totally without remorse her failed decisions as secretary of state unleashed isis onto the world  but has she ever apologized for the death and destruction she has caused no   look at the world before and after she became secretary of state prehillary in the early s iraq was seeing a reduction in violence libya was somewhat stable syria was under control the group we now know today isis was close to being extinguished iran was being choked by sanctions now take a look at what we have fast forward to the present time after hillary here is what it looks like iraq is in total chaos syria is in the midst of a disastrous civil war a refugee crisis now threatens europe and the united states where were taking in thousands and thousands and thousands of people isis has been unleashed unto the entire world iran the worlds top state sponsor of terrorism has been put on the path to nuclear weapons was given  million in ransom payment cash where they just yesterday caught obama in yet another lie  very much like  you can keep your doctor you can keep your plan obamacare  a total disaster it will be repealed it will be replaced  hillary clinton is a legacy of death destruction and terrorism america deserves a better legacy   all of you deserve a much much better future   i am the change agent i am the change agent    i am your messenger and i said it many times im nothing more than your messenger its a message of strong defense common sense take care of our vets great education get rid of common core great health care get rid of obamacare save our second amendment  which is under tremendous siege right now hillary clinton is the defender of the status quo or what we have while our country lost badly under hillary clinton she cashed in big time our country was losing our people were losing but she is cashing in bill clintons speaking fees surged while hillary was secretary of state he was paid almost  million for speeches during her tenure an increase in  percent over the previous four years by the way things came out today that blow everything away today then there was all of the money funneled into the clinton foundation from foreign governments and corporations it was pay for play  yet hillary clinton who is indifferent to the suffering she has caused has no remorse at all she offers no apologies no apologies for unleashing isis no apologies for her open borders no apologies for lying about her emails or about benghazi  the only way to learn the full depth of her public corruption is to read the  emails that she deleted   and the only way to get justice in this rigged system is to show up and vote on november th and vote big big big  and i will bring your jobs back so are you ready to vote   and what about your future is it going to be great good or terrible   great so if youre ready to vote for honest government and the honest government that you deserve a trump administration will end the corruption and restore integrity to government service remember im funding my campaign im spending tremendous amounts of money on running for office im raising money for the republican party and the republican national committee which i think is doing a very good job but ill tell you more about that on november th ill let you know if they do a good job or if they do not such a good job but i think theyre going to do a great job no one will be above the law in a trump administration the state department will work for the country not for hillary clintons donors  and i will work for you and i will work for no one else i will work for you i will never lie to you i will never put any other interests before you and i will never ever stop fighting for you never  the government will work for the people again that means we are only going to admit individuals into our country who support our values and were not going to issue visas where  screening  controls take place we are going to make sure that we have total screening and without it we cannot continue to have our government run like this we will also seek to join in partnership with any nation that wishes to join us in defeating and destroying isis  at home taxes will go down especially for  look i mean its going to go down for a lot of people for business theyre going down businesses are going to flourish theyre going to come pouring back but taxes will go down especially for middleincome americans  and small business rates will be lowered to  percent so we can put millions of new jobs into our poorest neighborhoods  as i said obamacare will be repealed and replaced voters not special interests will be in charge finally we are going to bring our country together again we have a divided country its totally divided the era of division will be replaced with a future of unity total unity we will love each other we will have one county everybody will work together  we are going to do it by emphasizing what we all have in common as americans its time to break with the failures of the past and to fight for every last child in this country to have the better future they deserve  in my administration every american will be treated equally protected equally and honored equally we will reject bigotry and hatred and oppression in all of its forms and seek a new future built on our common culture and values as one american people  this is the change i am promising to all of you an honest government with low taxes a thriving economy and a just society for each and every american its time to vote for a new american future  together we will make america wealthy again we will make america united again we will make america proud again we will make america safe again and we will make america great again god bless you  thank you thank you very much michigan thank you"
54,"Trump","thank you everybody so we began one hour early because the place is packed so why should we wait  thank you its great to be in ohio  i love this state i do i love this state where i once worked and had great experience and i must tell you above all i love the people of ohio  and i have a very special message for you tonight we are going to win ohio we are going to win the white house  and we are going to bring back your jobs that have been taken from your state and every other state in the union  were going to negotiate fair trade deals and what i mean by fair is great that put the american worker first  were going to stop the product dumping all over the place dumping and were going to stop the unfair foreign subsidies and the currency manipulation which is a form of cheating  we are going to stop all forms of cheating were going to bring our workers back were going to bring our country back were going to bring companies back into our country theyre going to hire lots of people youre going to get great jobs again youre going to get jobs that pay you a lot more money than youre making right now because i know whats happened to the american worker  the era of economic surrender which is what weve been doing for so long is over  a new era of real american greatness is ready to begin if i get elected president    no state has been hurt worse by the hillary clinton trade policies than the state of ohio hillary clinton backed her husbands nafta one of the worst deals made in the history of our country maybe the worst trade deal made ever anywhere in the world thats how bad she backed chinas entrance into the world trade organization she backed the jobkilling trade deal with south korea and she backed the transpacific partnership which she called the gold standard one bad deal after another hillary clintons donors own her they own her lock stock and barrel they own her and she will do whatever they tell her to do and when they own companies and they want that company to move to mexico folks your jobs are gone ok you dont have a chance thats the way the system works ohio and the akron area have lost nearly onethird of the manufacturing jobs since nafta onethird think of that and getting worse and as you stand here tonight there are companies right now negotiating to leave ok youll find out about it but well stop them just hang in there and it wont be hard wont be hard  this region and this state have lost nearly one in four manufacturing jobs since china entered the world trade organization our annual trade deficit in goods with the world is now nearly  billion is thats even believable  billion we have some great negotiators on our side dont we this subtracts directly from our growth our economy grew only  percent in the last quarter thats a total disaster that means theres no growth and its getting worse not better its getting worse this is the legacy of barack hussein obama and hillary clinton will be four more years and it will be worse in my opinion i am promising a new legacy for america we are going to create a new american future but to do that we have to stop the transpacific partnership we have to  and to do that youre going to have to on november th elect donald j trump as your president  thank you  november th our trade deficit with the proposed tpp member countries cost the state of ohio more than  manufacturing jobs just last year think of it  jobs theyre ripping them out of our country imagine how many more jobs would be lost if tpp was actually approved hillary clinton who called the tpp the gold standard would approve and by the way  percent  percent approval shes going to approve it if you remember her closest friend terry mcauliffe confirmed that thats what shes going to do with a wink and a nod we cant let it happen we cant let it happen that will be in my opinion as bad if thats possible as bad as nafta we will win this election and we will keep america out of tpp among many many other things  we will defend our freedom our jobs and our economic independence its going to be america first its not going to be america last america seventh america th because we want to take care of some company or take care of another country thats taking care of our politicians i put up my money folks you know what if i dont make it ive wasted a lot of money time and energy that i can tell you a lot but i think were going to win big i actually think theres something going on theres something going on  there is something going on whether its here or in pennsylvania or in virginia or florida i go to the arenas i start an hour i start two hours early and the places are packed with people outside i can start early because theyll fill up hours before im supposed to be there theres an enthusiasm thats going on that nobody has ever seen before there is something going on  my economic plan is going to grow this economy raise your wages which in many cases havent gone up in real wage for over  years youre making less money now many of the people in this room making less money now than you made  years ago youre working harder and in some cases you have two jobs its not supposed to work that way its supposed to be the other way youre getting older youre working harder youre making less not going to happen we are going to create millions and millions of new jobs  here are a few of the things we are going to do this you will like a massive tax cut for working americans and a  percent tax rate for small businesses  look at those people theyre still pouring in i love seeing it pouring in  its really  thank you  its beautiful beautiful look   its really beautiful thank you thank you everybody see to me that means so much when you see that scene look at the doors pouring in all filling up unbelievable unbelievable  i dont know how i explain to them that we started an hour early i dont know thank you everybody i appreciate it thank you we are going to eliminate regulations that kill american jobs and that includes getting rid of the obama administrations new antienergy rules that will lift your energy bills up by more than  percent very very shortly these obamaclinton energy restrictions are a tax on the poor and they devastate lowincome africanamerican and latino americans it is a disaster ohio gets  percent of its electricity from coalpowered energy right  hillary clinton says she wants to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business exactly just like she wants to put the steelworkers out of business she wants to put a lot of businesses out of business we are going to put the miners and the steelworkers back to work and we are going to get your energy bills down fast  we are going to repeal and replace obamacare saving another  million jobs over the next decade alone  another major part of our agenda is law and order  more than  people have been shot in chicago alone since the beginning of this year this is one of the biggest differences between me and my opponent i believe that safety is a right that belongs to all americans  all americans  and i want to take this opportunity to thank the law enforcement and police officials that are here with us tonight   and all across the country for their service and sacrifice in these very dangerous especially for them dangerous and difficult times they are terrific so thank you to law enforcement and police  working with citizens and police we will bring safety to communities across this land but especially to those and these places that have not known safety in a very very long time i want every parent and child in this society including so importantly every africanamerican and hispanic citizen to be able to live in a safe thriving and prosperous community its time  this is the new american future that were working all together to create hillary clinton is the past shes been there forever shes done nothing but mistakes shes got bad bad judgment mistake after mistake we are the future  another major part of our agenda is immigration security we need to protect american jobs we need to protect american safety  were going to build a wall folks were going to build a wall were going to build it dont worry were going to build a wall  that wall will go up so fast your head will spin and youll say you know he meant it and you know what else i mean mexico is going to pay for the wall  lowincome workers are hurt the most by my opponents policies poor hispanic and africanamerican citizens are the first to lose a job or see a pay cut when we dont control our borders so true according to pew research immigration over the next  years will add another  million to our population we will be much much more and its going to be much much more under hillary clintons radical plans shes got a radical plan you know where she got it she got it probably from bernie who took her so far left wait until you see what she does to the united states supreme court but were not going to give her that chance ok were not going to give her that chance  thats so unfair to the lowincome workers africanamerican latino all americans living here today and trying to get a job and get ahead hillary clintons plan amounts to total and absolute total open borders its open borders ive met with the families who have lost loved ones to sanctuary cities and violence spilling across our border parents like my friend jamiel shaw mary ann mendoza sabine durden and laura wilkerson hillary clinton is either too corrupt or too cowardly to meet with the families of those killed by the policies she and obama support hillary clinton has totally has forgotten the first rule of public service the job of an elected official is to serve the citizens of the united states thats what the job is and if you dont understand that then you are not fit to run for the office of president of the united states  if you are not prepared to put american workers first then you should not hold or seek public office were not working for somebody else were not working for another country its just that simple no issue better illustrates how corrupt my opponent is than her payforplay scandals as secretary of state as the evidence has become public over the last several months i have become increasingly shocked by the vast scope of hillary clintons criminality its criminality everybody knows it everybody knows it our country has gotten so far behind everybody knows it hillary clinton said she turned over all of her workrelated emails   she testified that to congress under penalty of perjury now we learn about another  emails she failed to turn over and they have just been discovered i guess today and dont forget the  emails shes already deleted colin powell just proved again how dishonest hillary clinton is after he busted her for trying to pin the email scandal on him one more hillary clinton lie her foundation took in large payments from major corporations and wealthy individuals foreign and domestic and all the while she was secretary of state the clinton foundation accepted as much as  million from middle eastern countries that oppress women gays and people of different faiths the foundation donors included corporations and individuals with significant matters before the state department not good and then either hillary clinton herself or one of her closest aides took action favorable to these donors her actions corrupted and disgraced one of the most important departments of government indeed one of only four established by the united states constitution itself the clintons made the state department into the same kind of payforplay operation as the arkansas government was now think of what happened back then think about it and i love the state of arkansas were winning it big but ill tell you they know what went on they know and theyre not happy pay the clinton foundation huge sums of money and throw in some big speaking fees for bill clinton and you got to play you got to do what you wanted to do its pretty sad this is in front of the state department this is in front of the state department and long before that you should have seen what they were doing in arkansas same old story folks the amounts involved the favors done and the significant number of times it was done require an expedited investigation by a special prosecutor immediately immediately immediately  after the fbi and department of justice whitewashed hillary clintons email crimes they certainly cannot be trusted to quickly or impartially investigate hillary clintons new crimes which happen all the time some former prosecutors have even suggested that the coordination between the payforplay state department and the corrupt clinton foundation constitute a clear example of rico racketeering influenced corrupt organization enterprise the justice department is required to appoint an independent special prosecutor because it has proven itself to be really sadly a political arm of the white house nobody has ever seen anything like this before the department of justice has acted very unethically particularly the attorney generals private lengthy minute meeting in the back of an airplane before the departments decision not to prosecute her for crimes that would have been prosecuted against any other citizen in our country if the justice department fails to do so it will make it even clearer that a second of four primary constitutional departments have been corrupted its as simple as that every major lawyer you look every major lawyer is saying the same thing they cant believe it happened they know the facts they cant believe it happened the justice department and the fbi they cannot believe whats going on in this country and other countries are talking about it and they cant believe whats happening either heres one example of clinton corruption as secretary of state hillary clinton signed off on a deal allowing russians to take an increased stake in a company called uranium one giving up control of about  percent of americas uranium supply to the russians wonderful deal you know what happens to uranium you all know what happens to uranium and they need it in russia clintons approval of the deal netted the owners of the uranium company millions and millions of dollars in exchange for signing off on the deal some of the former owners of uranium one gave the clinton foundation millions and millions of dollars in donations in addition bill clinton received over  for a speech to a kremlinbacked investment firm that was a beneficiary of the deal here is another example of payforplay in  a company called ericsson came under us pressure for selling telecom equipment to several oppressive governments including sudan syria and iran some these regimes used those technologies to monitor and control their own people in june  hillary clintons state department began adding goods and services to a list that might be covered under expanded sanctions on iran and other state sponsors of terrorism during that time ericsson sponsored a speech by bill clinton paying him  his highestpaying speech in april  the obama administration issued an executive order imposing sanctions on telecom sales to iran and syria but those sanctions did not cover ericssons work in iran a trump administration will end the government corruption  no one will be above the law we will have one set of rules for everyone in hillary clintons world we have one set of rules for her and another set of rules for everyone else i am fighting for everyone who doesnt have a voice i will be your voice believe me  i just get the feeling were going to win in a landslide  hillary clintons campaign is funded by wall street and hedge fund managers my campaign is powered by my money but also by small donations from working people across this country who want their country back  the average donation last month was about  so beautiful to see that and that doesnt happen often with our republicans and thats ok but ill tell you so glad to see it its a movement folks its a movement thats going on this is a movement this is a movement    nothing terrifies the ruling class more than when everybody working and i mean everybody and everyday working people give    to a campaign like ours they are very concerned they couldnt believe when they saw the numbers it is in fact something very very special thats happening because its never really happened like this certainly for the republican party its never happened like this before  were going to take government away from the special interests that give her tens of millions of dollars so that she can broadcast absolutely phony adds about me and were going to give it back to the voters and by the way those ads are absolutely phony with the exception of certain little parts of them a couple of little things are correct but well get over it  come november th we are once again going to have a government that serves you and your family and your country not the special interests the donors and the lobbyists  we are going to rebuild our depleted military avoid needless foreign wars build new friendships overseas and remember those three famous words peace through strength  we are going to work with our allies to crush defeat and utterly destroy isis we are going to have a new immigration screening test to keep people out of our country who dont support our tolerant values we are going to have extreme vetting remember extreme vetting we want people in our country but we want people that have the ability to love us and respect us  we are also going to reject the bigotry of hillary clinton who sees people of color only as votes and not as human beings worthy of a better future so true that is so true  the democratic party has run nearly every inner city for  years  years  years and even more than a hundred years they have produced only poverty failing schools and broken homes in the last eight years the africanamerican labor force participation has declined another  percentage points and its dropped another  percentage points for teenagers and thats already from the most dismal numbers in history nearly four in  africanamerican children live in poverty africanamerican home ownership has declined nearly  percentage points from record levels this is just in the last short while also since  another  million latinos have fallen into poverty incomes for latino workers fell by almost another  a year again by terrible standards meanwhile homicides are up nearly  percent in washington dc and more than  percent in baltimore and up all over the place no matter where you look the level of crime in these cities is something no american should consider acceptable it should not be considered acceptable  our government has totally failed our africanamerican friends our hispanic friends and the people of our country period the democrats have failed completely in the inner cities for those hurting the most who have been failed and failed by their politicians year after year failure after failure worse numbers after worse numbers poverty rejection horrible education no housing no homes no ownership crime at levels that nobodys seen you can go to war zones in countries that were fighting and its safer than living in some of our inner cities that are run by the democrats and i ask you this i ask you this crime all of the problems to the africanamericans who i employ so many so many people to the hispanics tremendous people what the hell do you have to lose give me a chance ill straighten it out ill straighten it out  what do you have to lose and you know i say it and im going to keep saying it and some people say wow that makes sense and then some people say well that wasnt very nice look it is a disaster the way africanamericans are living in many cases and in many cases the way hispanics are living and i say it with such a deepfelt feeling what do you have to lose i will straighten it out  ill bring jobs back well bring spirit back well get rid of the crime youll be able to walk down the street without getting shot right now you walk down the street and you get shot look at the statistics well straighten it out if you keep voting for the same failed politicians you will keep getting the same results they dont care about you they just like you once every four years get your vote and then they say byebye  what do you have to lose and you know what ill do a great job ill do a great job  but most importantly i want to talk to you about really what you have to gain those hurting in our country have so much to gain by joining our campaign for a new and more inclusive american future tax reforms will add millions of new jobs and thousands of small businesses my energy reforms will create millions of new jobs and lower the price of your energy bills which right now are going through the roof  my trade reforms will raise wages grow jobs and add trillions of dollars in new wealth to our country and to our people my immigration reforms will protect your jobs and stop businesses from exploiting visa programs that hurt poor workers and everybody else  my infrastructure plans will rebuild your roads your bridges your tunnels your airports which are in terrible shape the worst shape theyve been in in over  years my regulatory reform will make it easier for africanamerican small businesses to thrive and for young children to live out their dreams without crime and without being scared to walk down the street  my promise of school choice  you know what the word choice is its called competition  my promise of the word choice charter schools and merit pay for teachers will help lowincome students in our inner cities teachers one of the most important professions no matter what you do there is nothing so important  we love our teachers we love our teachers weve got to take care of our teachers got to take care of our teachers hillary clinton discriminates against poor africanamerican children by opposing school choice for votes she wants the votes my government reforms will make your voice heard not the voice of the special interests every insider getting rich off of our broken system is throwing money at hillary clinton its the powerful protecting the powerful excuse me i used to be there i know the system very well  i know the system better than anybody its insiders fighting for insiders but i am fighting for you im fighting for you  every day you turn on the nightly news you hear about how some selfinterested banker or some washington insider says they oppose the trump campaign thats because i dont need them i dont want them im going to do whats good for you  or some encrusted old politician says they oppose my campaign i certainly dont need them or some bigtime lobbyist says they oppose donald trumps campaign because i dont

new york post column recently deroy murdock published data confirming what ive been saying about the devastating economic conditions in the africanamerican communities murdock confirms these facts the overall labor force participation rate   the overall labor force participation rate for black americans has slipped from  percent down to  percent recently this metric also slump for black teenagers from  percent to  percent down  percent going in the wrong direction everything going in the wrong direction our country is going in the wrong direction  the percentage of black americans in poverty has grown under obama the census bureau reports from  percent in  to  percent up too much too much the number of blacks on food stamps soared under obama to  million people in  up  percent  also from obamas arrival through last june  the percentage of black americans who own homes plunged  percent  nearly four in  africanamerican children live in poverty thats no good and not fair fiftyeight percent of young african americans are not employed homicide is up nearly  percent in washington dc and up more than  percent in baltimore and up throughout all of our inner cities violent crime rose  percent in the  largest us cities this is the legacy of president obama and hillary clinton it cant get any worse  to those suffering i say what do you have to lose in trying trump what do you have to lose i will fix it i will fix it  i will fix the problem with rates of crime with rates of poverty like youve just heard what do you have to lose i will fix the problem we will fix it let me tell you

safe so when you walk down the street you dont get shot which is whats happening now thats whats happening now success has to be created for everyone and it has to be available to everyone thats how were going to create a new american future but to make every american safe and prosperous we must address one of the most vital issues of all border security    we are going to build the wall  and who is going to pay for the wall   mexico is going to pay for the wall we have massive trade deficits with mexico with china with japan with everybody those deficits will go away were going to bring our jobs back youre going to be so happy but mexico in fact will pay for the wall  percent  we are going to enforce the law were going to protect your jobs and your wages we are going to protect them your companies are not going to flee our country think they can make their product and sell it back into our country without serious repercussion  we are going to keep our country safe according to the texas government nearly  illegal immigrants were booked into texas jails between  and   collectively those arrested were responsible for more than half a million criminal offenses including  homicides  sexual assault charges   and more than  charges of either burglary or theft  not going to happen folks were not going to let it happen to our country its enough yet hillary clinton wants a totally open border  she wants catch and release  she wants obamacare and other things for illegal immigrants in many cases more than our great veterans get  she has said shes going to give massive amnesty in her first  days  she wants to gut immigration enforcement the immigration people to such a great job but they have no leadership at the top she supports sanctuary cities  she wants to let people overstay their visas without removal  one lawless order after another we must not let that happen we are going to vote for president donald trump and were going to stop it    we love texas  love texas hillary clinton also wants a  percent increase over obama whos letting them come in by the thousands in syrian refugees we have no idea who they are where they come from no paperwork the great trojan horse its going to be trouble folks there have been hundreds of immigrants and their children charged with terrorism inside the united states since  and a number of terrible attacks like the boston bombing san bernardino and orlando yet hillary clinton wants to fling open the flood gates to our borders let everybody come in open up our country let people pour in we dont know anything about them its going to be a nightmare for our country just like its turning out to be an absolute nightmare for europe just ask them whats going on  i want to create safe zones in the middle east and well get the gulf states to pay for them we owe almost  trillion folks were not paying but we want to help people look i have as big a heart as anybody believe me we have to help people were going to build safe zones in the middle east were going to get the gulf states to chip in to pay for them because they have the money theyre not doing what theyre supposed to be doing  my plan suspends visas when we cant perform effective screening and it puts forward a new ideological screening program to keep out people from our country who dont support our values  im calling it extreme vetting extreme vetting after all that is what taking the oath of citizenship is all about  thank you thank you   is there any place thats better to be or safer to be than a trump rally  right  right in the heart of texas  this election so important will decide whether or not we have a border this election will decide whether or not we have a country today i met with the moms of incredible american children killed by illegal immigrants as a result of the policies of hillary clinton and barack obama  hillary clinton will never meet with these families she will never hear their incredible but so sad stories she will never hear she doesnt have the heart believe me   i would like to invite the mothers who lost their children to illegal immigration to join me on the stage right now these are great people theyre here with the incredible remembrance project come on up  i also want to invite very very special people that ive gotten to know over the years and theyve given me their endorsement first time ever in their history the border patrol folks they are so good  these are incredible people the suffering that the families have gone through is incredible and jamiel shaw another friend of mine what hes gone through is just unbelievable so i just want to thank you i want to say that we are with you  percent and your children did not die in vain because were not going to allow it to happen to others so thank you very much  give them a big hand thank you very much border patrol amazing come here shaw come here say something thank you         incredible people what theyve gone through incredible  thank you fellas thank you and so many more hundreds thousands so many more we will never let these families down on immigration clinton is bought and paid for by special interests shes never going to do the right thing   this corruption relates closely to another corruption scandal that strikes at the heart of our country and our democracy every day more and more alarming facts come out    what are you going to do the scandal i speak of is the state departments payforplay its right now being looked at very seriously probably nothing will happen even though it should happen because she is being protected by our country like nothing ever before and its a disgrace and as the world watches its such an embarrassment to everyone in this big arena it is a total embarrassment if the secretary of state can be bought or bribed or sold look whats happening right now with government favors then the whole american system is threatened so many people for doing so far less are right now suffering tremendous repercussions tremendous for doing so far less for doing a tiny fraction of what hillary clinton did it is a disgrace this is a threat to the foundation of democracy a threat this is what happens in third world countries its the failed conditions of people and this is why they flee to america and they come here and they get no better our laws and our country is being jeopardized america can never elect a candidate who like hillary clinton did government favors for those giving her family and her foundation massive amounts of cash   the new revelations about hillary clintons email scandal made clear we have only seen the tip of the iceberg hillary clinton is desperate to cover up her crimes and she has been unsuccessful except that some people that head up some very important groups have said its ok even though it was never ok for others thats why she deleted  emails and she got away with it sort of   thats also why she lied repeatedly to congress and to the american public she said she never sent or received classified materials   that was a lie proved over and over again she claims she used her email server for the convenience of using only one device   but she used multiple devices so that was yet another lie   she said she turned over all of her workrelated emails but the fbi found thousands she never turned over and now just recently found another  more   that was another lie can you imagine can you imagine what she had on the  deleted emails can you imagine she said she sent nothing marked classified a total lie unmasked to the entire world and more and more to come she said her server was secure and had no breaches but we know now what was completely unsecure and the fbi director said it could be easily hacked by foreign enemies   more clinton lies clinton said her lawyers reviewed all of her emails before destroying them that was a lie and why were her lawyers let free when they destroyed the emails   lie after lie after lie hillary clinton is totally unfit to hold public office    it is impossible to figure out where the clinton foundation ends and the state department begins it is now abundantly clear that the clintons set up a business to profit from public office they sold access and specific actions by and really for i guess the making of large amounts of money   today a phone log was released for cheryl mills   i will say this the bernie protestors were much better more  they were much  they had much more vim and vigor  these have very very very little energy so you had a phone log today that was released she was secretary of state clintons chief of staff you would expect the log to contain only calls concerning department of state business but cheryl mills received  messages between  and  from the chief operating officer of the clinton foundation no other individual or group appears to have left that many messages we also just learned today that more than half the people who met with hillary clinton from outside government while she was secretary of state were donors to the clinton foundation   the specific crimes committed to carry out that enterprise are too numerous to cover in this speech i walked through two of them yesterday the sale of us uranium to russia and the exemption of a telecom giant from sanctions after they paid bill clinton a tremendous amount of money for a speech   the ubs saga is another one shortly after hillary clinton became secretary of state she went to geneva and intervened in a dispute concerning secret identities of americans thats nice she negotiated a very good deal for ubs and a very bad deal for law enforcement of the  accounts the us was seeking the government settled for only  her intervention was described by treasury as unusual before her unusual intervention ubs had donated only  to the foundation after the clinton favor for ubs it opened its wallet for big bucks and out came a  contribution a  million loan and a  million speaking fee for bill clinton   this is corruption and this is why i have called for a special prosecutor to look into this mess  justice is supposed to be blind its never supposed to be for sale hillary clinton thinks shes above the law come november the american people will show her that she is not we will have a tremendous victory on nov  we will win and we will make america great again  you will be voting for justice fairness equality and jobs we will be working on making our inner cities and africanamerican people who have suffered so long in these unsafe horrible places they will be so proud of what takes place over the next four years if im elected president  you will also be voting for a more inclusive country where no one no one is left out another two million latinas have joined the ranks of those in poverty no good incomes for latino households have declined by nearly  under president obama the number of latino children living in poverty increased by  percent our progrowth projobs profamily agenda is going to bring back hope to every community in our nation  i will dedicate myself to restore the ladder of success to all of those who live in poverty of which there are tremendous numbers we reject the bigotry of hillary clinton who sees communities of color only as votes not as human beings worthy of a better future she is a disgrace  the era of division is coming to an end we will create a new future of american unity are you ready for real real real american change  youll get it and itll be beautiful  its time to emphasize what we all have in common as americans we will promote our common culture values and principles we will be one nation we will be one people we will share together one great future  its going to be america first again  we will make america proud again  we will make america prosperous again  and we will make america safe again  friends citizens and fellow americans we will make america great again thank you god bless you thank you nov  go out and vote thank you everybody thank you thank you"

depleted military  we love our military its been so badly depleted folks at a time when we need it just about the most ever we are going to rebuild our depleted military and no better people than are in our military but were going to rebuild it were going to take care of our great veterans they have been left behind were going to take care of our great veterans were going to unleash american energy restore law and order  and we will make government honest once again which it is not now believe me the stakes in this election could not be higher hillary clinton wants to raise taxes very substantially and send jobs to other countries thats what she wants to do  we are going to cut taxes dramatically and bring thousands of new companies and millions of new jobs to our shores  and that is something i look so forward to doing no one can do jobs like trump if you look at florida whether its doral or whether its so many of the jobs we have on the beach we have so many jobs in the state of florida and ill tell you what those people love what weve done for them high wages great jobs health care education we take care of our people we have to take care of the people of our country believe me we are not doing that  hillary clinton wants to pass more terrible trade deals like the transpacific partnership she wants to pass it  we are going to stop the tpp totally renegotiate nafta one of the worst trade deals ever made by mankind and protect every last american job were going to protect your jobs theyre not going to be disappearing from you anymore  people in this room  years ago were making more money in wages than theyre making today and today theyre working harder and in many cases to a certain extent because of this horrible obamacare theyre working two jobs so theyre getting older theyre working harder and they are making less not going to happen that way folks not going to happen  of course im working harder also and getting old thats for sure hillary clinton wants to expand the job killing regulations destroying small businesses in america regulations by the way are out of control in this country were going to cancel every needless jobkilling regulation and put a moratorium on new regulations until our economy gets back on its feet and even then theyre not going to be brought back theyre not going to be brought back  theyre not going to be brought back you know we need safety we need a little environmental protection we want clean air we want clean water but what theyve done on top of that has been insane its killing our businesses and it doesnt allow our businesses to compete with other countries and youre losing your jobs we will create great numbers of american jobs beyond anything youve ever witnessed i will be the greatest jobs president that god ever created the greatest    and speaking of jobs and speaking of the fact that were going to do a great job on jobs evangelicals people of religion christians jews catholics muslims everybody youve got to get out and vote on november th  and theres only one person you can vote for donald trump were going to do it were going to do it were going to do it   hillary clinton wants to put the miners and the steelworkers out of work youve heard her  youve heard her we are going to lift restrictions on all american energy and we are going to stand up to foreign cheating  which is what theyre doing theyre cheating  that threatens steel production in america theyre dumping all over this country because they want our steel to go out of business so they can make this deal for us and charge us plenty not going to happen folks not going to happen  hillary clinton wants to expand jobkilling obamacare and put government in charge of your health care you know where that leads  they tried that in venezuela you see whats happening not working and many other places it doesnt work we are going to repeal  and this is so important are you ready we are going to repeal and replace obamacare and create  and by the way i have to tell you  always gets one of the most incredible applause  people are dying with obamacare its a disaster your premiums are going up by  percent  percent the number on november st  and theyre trying to move the date because its an election changing number  is going to be close to  percent it could even be more than that they want to make it in december they dont want to reveal the numbers obamacare is a disaster in the great state of texas they had almost a  percent increase going through blue cross blue shield  almost a  percent increase and the people are furious youre going to have more than that and folks its not going to work its dying of its own weight regardless of who becomes president it is dead shes going to try and save it by raising everybodys taxes believe me we can come up with a plan that will be so much less expensive and so much better and we will do that  we will create choice and competition and thats going to really make it swing its going to be an amazing thing to watch all right hillary clinton wants to trap children in failing schools  percent i want school choice choice choice so you have competition i want charter schools and i want merit pay for our great teachers we should have merit pay nobody more important than a teacher we should have merit pay for those teachers that are outstanding we are going to put our kids onto the ladder of success and that is a good education and then a great job thats what we need  this is so important for our inner cities our inner cities are suffering like never before they have been run by democrats for so many years in some cases over  years almost every inner city is run by the democrats nearly four in  africanamerican children live in poverty think of it fiftyeight percent of african american youth are not employed  percent more than  people have been shot in chicago since the beginning of the year not a long time homicides are up nearly  percent in washington dc and more than  percent in baltimore the democratic party has run as ive said nearly every inner city in this country for  or  or in some cases over  years over  years theyve produced only more poverty only more crime only more joblessness and broken homes all over the place at record levels to those suffering and hurting and the people left behind i say vote for donald trump vote for donald trump    what do you have to lose what do you have to lose it cannot get any worse and believe me im going to fix it im going to make it so good so to the africanamerican voter  great people to the hispanic voter who have been absolutely treated terribly i say what do you have to lose what i will fix it ill be able to make sure that when you walk down the street in your inner city or wherever you are youre not going to be shot your child isnt going to be shot last night i brought some incredible families up on stage with me people that lost their child to illegal immigration people whose child has been killed people who have lost children  devastated can never be the same  to people that came into the country illegally were going to fix that problem and were going to fix our inner cities and i say to the africanamerican parents you have a right to walk down the street of your city without having your child or yourself shot and thats whats happening right now thats whats happening  to the hispanic parents you have a right to walk outside without being shot you have a right to good education for your child you have a right to own your home you have a right to have a good job the democrats and hillary clinton policies once she gets  if she gets your vote  and i think were going to do great with africanamericans and with the hispanics but once she gets your votes you know what she does byebye folks see you in four years thats what it is shes going to do nothing shes going to do nothing and you know what the truth  she doesnt have the stamina to do it even if she wanted to believe me im asking for the honor of your vote so that i can fight for you thats africanamerican thats hispanics and thats all americans were going to make it better much much better  because hispanic citizens have been suffering under this president too since president obama came into office another two million hispanics have joined the ranks of those in poverty two million have joined the ranks of poverty not of wealth i want you to join the  the ranks of people that are making phenomenal livings thats what you want to join  the number of hispanic children living in poverty increased by  percent in that short period of time so im going to fight to give every hispanic citizen in this country a much better future a much better life and they know it and they know it  and i dont know if youve seen whats happening but over the last three weeks the polls with africanamerican folks and spanish speaking folks the hispanics latinos have gone way up way up theyve gone way up because you know what african americans are tired of being used by these phony politicians hispanics are tired of being used by these phony politicians and everybody else in our country is tired of being used by these phony politicians believe me  and part of that better future means securing our border to protect the jobs of all of the people living here today and that includes africanamericans hispanic americans and all americans were going to protect your jobs were going to also bring safety but were going to protect your jobs because your jobs are not being protected hillary clinton wants to have a totally open border where people can just pour in and take your job and lots of other things happen  we are going to enforce our laws remove people who overstay their visas dismantle the gangs and cartels and protect jobs and benefits for hardworking american citizens  and many of them are africanamerican by the way and many of them are hispanic were going to protect your jobs that includes protecting the jobs and wages of the hispanic citizens that and living right here in florida so many living right here in florida and this is their number one complaint because they dont know if the next day theyre going to have a job because of people flowing in illegally into the state and into the country they deserve to have their jobs protected from illegal immigration and broken visa programs and they are broken all americans from all backgrounds have a right to have their jobs protected in their own country hillary clinton would rather give a job to an illegal immigrant than to an unemployed hispanic citizen an unemployed africanamerican citizen or even to a veteran believe me  its going to be america first from now on america first    thank you at the core of our america first agenda are three words so important these are so important they solve so many problems are you ready   jobs jobs jobs  thats why at the center of my economic plan is a tax cut for small businesses down to  percent from  percent  business will flourish jobs will pour into our country and new ones will be created and i mean created all across the land were going to create jobs thirtyfive percent  were one of the highest taxed nations in the world if not the highest and were going to be one of the lower taxed nations in the world  there are over  hispanicowned businesses here in florida hillary clintons plan would smother them with new regulations drive up their electricity bills and then raise their taxes to as much as almost  percent higher than theyre paying now familyowned businesses would take a second hit with a  percent death tax so that you have a business you want to leave that business to your children youve been paying taxes all your life on that business and now the children have to pay so much that normally they have to either sell the business or close it up its not a fair tax more in florida than anywhere else because you have so many family businesses that cannot afford to pay a death tax a trump administration will be a true friend to small businesses and to all working americans that i can tell you  that means bringing down taxes bringing down the price of energy and bringing down jobkilling regulations that cost our economy as much as  trillion a year   trillion a year remember  trillion does anyone know what a trillion dollars is weve got two of them were also going to dramatically simplify our very very complex tax code  hampr block will be voting against donald trump that i can tell you our current  and you understand that our current tax code is so burdensome and complex that we waste nine billion hours he year in tax code compliance that will end under a trump administration hillary clinton wants to make taxes even more complicated and will raise taxes by  trillion on you and everybody else  her antienergy regulations will be a tax hike on the poor your energy bills are going to go through the roof folks according to heritage foundation by  the obamaclinton energy restrictions will eliminate another half a million manufacturing jobs reduce economic output by  trillion and reduce incomes by  a person per year that means youre making less money in  than youre making right now weve already done that  years ago right now as a country we have no growth we have no growth you saw that a trump administration will end this war on the american worker and unleash an energy revolution that will bring vast new wealth and power to our country  according to the institute for energy research lifting the restrictions on all sources of american energy will very simply increase gdp by more than  billion dollars annually we need that so badly add over  new jobs annually and increase annual wages by more than  billion over the next seven years  it will increase federal state and local tax revenue by almost  trillion over four decades increase total economic activity by more than  trillion over the next  years my energy plan will help put trillions of dollars back into our economy well be able to fix up our military well be able to take care of our vets well be able to help you with your social security which everybody else wants to cut to shreds  now with all of that being said my alltime favorite subject trade how stupid are we to allow this to happen to us florida has lost one in four manufacturing jobs since bill clinton signed nafta a hillary clintonbacked deal one of the worst transactions ever signed in the history of our country probably not as bad as will be proven in the future as this horrible incompetent iran deal but well get that  well get to that a little bit later thats another beauty honestly these people dont know what theyre doing they dont know what theyre doing they dont know what they are doing florida lost one in five of its manufacturing jobs since bill clinton and china  and he put china into the world trade organization which was also backed by hillary our trade deficit with the world is now nearly  billion a year so we work hard we work so hard but if you dont have the right leadership at the top youre sort of wasting your time because youre not going to get it done think of it we have a trade deficit  trade deficit with the world of almost  billion dollars like bernie sanders said she has terrible terrible judgment got no judgment look at what shes got folks take a look at the emails shes got no judgment the good news is if we win on november th these jobs are coming back theyre all coming back  here are seven steps to bring back our jobs and create millions of new jobs number one im going to withdraw the united states from the transpacific partnership talks which have yet to be ratified so important  number two im going to appoint the toughest and smartest trade negotiators to fight on behalf of american workers so that we make great trade deals with other countries instead of incompetent and bad trade deals  well bring our jobs back here instead of having  its like a oneway  its like a oneway bridge it all goes out of this country the only thing that comes into our country is drugs they pour into the country the cash pours out we dont do anything right we have such bad leadership im going to direct the secretary of commerce to identify every violation of trade agreements that a foreign country is currently using to harm american workers of which there are many  because they rightfully think were run by incompetent people so i dont blame china i dont blame japan and mexico and these other countries theyre getting away with murder but if i were them id be trying to do the same thing i blame our leaders i want us to be on the winning side we will be on the winning side if you elect me on november th i promise  i will then direct all appropriate agencies to use every tool under american and international law to end these abuses were being abused now the worst abuser is china i like china ive made a lot of money with china ive done very well with china theyre tenants of mine  their biggest bank in the world is a tenant  condos deals office buildings bank of america buildings so much ive done great with china we can do great with china too they have no respect for our country they have no respect for our leadership and we dont blame them we dont blame them we want to put ourselves in that position very soon you watch and theyll like us better than they do now they dont like us theyre building a massive military fortress in the middle of the south china sea that theyre not allowed to do theyre doing that and yet theyre ripping us economically we have tremendous power over china  economic power  tremendous we dont do anything they build and build and build and they didnt get environmental impact statements when they decided to rip up the sea they said  sunday night lets build monday morning they were digging a little different than our country wouldnt you say a little different a little bit different number four im going to tell our nafta partners that i intend to immediately renegotiate the terms of that horrible agreement signed by bill clinton to get a better deal for our workers and if we dont get the deal that we want which has to be good and has to make up for all of these years of abuse and lost time then we will walk away which is fine  im going to instruct my treasury secretary to label china a currency manipulator the greatest in the world any country that devalues their currency in order to take unfair advantage of the united states and all of its companies who cant compete will face tariffs and taxes to stop the cheating and when they see that they will stop the cheating i dont think our politicians even know whats going on and they will stop or were going to take in one hell of a lot of money ill tell you that im going to instruct the united states trade representative to bring trade cases against china both in this country and at the wto world trade organization chinas unfair subsidy and its behavior is prohibited by the terms of its entrance into the wto and i intend to enforce our rules thats all very simple  and they know its coming theyve called a lot of friends of mine they know its coming they say what do we do what do we do if china does not stop its illegal activities  remember this our trade deficit with china is approximately  billion a year think of that  billion somebody said oh but youll stop trading with china i said is that good or bad you tell me we have to straighten it out folks we cant have deficits of  billion we cant have deficits and we can start making things right here again and itll be very nice  and im going to use every lawful presidential power to remedy the trade disputes including the application of tariffs and ill tell you were going to probably have to at least use them in some cases because they have to understand were not playing games any longer folks were not playing games  if we take these steps jobs and factories will come roaring back into our country we can use the new money to rebuild our roads bridges and airports manufacturing is also a matter of national security its national security our manufacturing is being decimated decimated were not going to have manufacturing i am so tired of seeing manufacturing buildings that employed thousands and thousands of people being turned into nursing homes its fine but you know what thats not  we have to  we have to  we have to build we have to build we have to manufacture we need to build produce and create right here in america right here in america  let me tell you a few more things that were going to do were going to end government corruption  hillary clinton ran the state department like a failed leader in a thirdworld country thats what its run  its run like a third world country she sold favors and access in exchange for cash she sold it she sold favors she sold access and wait until you see when its revealed all of those people now it looks like its  percent of the people that saw her had to make contributions to the clinton foundation wait until you see ultimately what she did for all of those people wait until you see these are not people that go in as i said and talk about how are you feeling the people she met with outside of government   the people she met with outside government as secretary of state so many of these people made contributions she even deleted  emails to hide evidence of her crimes its impossible to tell where the clinton foundation ends and the state department begins she then lied about her crime to congress over and over again she lied to congress i dont know if congress is going to do anything about it folks im so sick of looking and seeing and i hear reports they dont do anything  congress ought to act she lied to congress  percent everybody agrees and it takes so long for them to act by the time they act youre going to say what was it you wont even remembered what happened let congress act today let congress act immediately  the fbi did not act i have such respect for the fbi i am so disappointed i am so disappointed i love the fbi i have such high regard  high respect for the fbi how did they let that happen she was so guilty she was so guilty the world is laughing at us folks and then you have bill clinton meeting with the attorney general in the back of an airplane for  minutes  and he said they were talking about golf and their grandkids give me a break and very importantly bill clinton after all of that and after the beautiful gift he was given bill clinton essentially called the fbi director james comey a liar when he said the fbi director was spouting bull can you imagine man they dont realize that they owe the fbi director their political lives for refusing to recommend prosecution for hillary clintons many many crimes and then he calls the director a liar he saved hillary clinton from facing justice for her illegal and corrupt actions they were illegal and they were corrupt and the fbi saved her and i would imagine many people within the fbi are extremely embarrassed extremely remember bill clinton was impeached for lying and obstructing justice and also had to give up his law license  people forget hillary clinton created an illegal private email server deliberately willfully and with total premedication  premeditation it could the first way was right actually you know i might like the first way better  premedication thats a very premedication  i think i like it  all right premeditation i love that she did so to cover up a vast pay for play scheme her actions made our enemies vulnerable to foreign hacking and we are vulnerable thats whats happened weve become so vulnerable to foreign hacking and betrayed the security and safety of the united states our military and all of our people her actions are criminal theyre purposeful and theyre totally calculated she knew what she was doing thats why i call for a special prosecutor to look into this  the problem is with the administration rigging the system  its a rigged system folks  to protect her vast criminal behavior the real jury is going to be the american voter on november th  hillary clinton thinks she is above the law shes got  and honestly folks shes got nothing going shes got nothing going theres nothing there theres nothing going theres nothing for you thats going to be four more years of obama four more years of isis knocking the hell out of us all over the place and everyone else  got nothing going come november the american people are going to prove that she is not  she is not a person worthy of becoming the president of the united states  we dont want four more years of obama and i think she would be worse than obama ive been watching so carefully over the past month hillary clinton doesnt do speeches she doesnt do press conferences its been almost  days she doesnt do rallies of any consequence she doesnt do this kind of stuff we have all these  shes failed at filling the arenas if you look at her events they should show those arenas they never show our arena is packed but they should show her arenas that are empty  people dont know where she is her supports have really  her supporters have very little enthusiasm the only people enthusiastic about her campaign are hollywood celebrities in many cases celebrities that arent very hot anymore and wall street donors special interests lobbyists et cetera that want to control government not to the benefit of our country but to the benefit of their wallet  even her protesters dont have the spirit that bernie protesters had we had some protesters last night we had a massive rally last night and we had some protesters its like they raised their hand and people  theyre so nice the cameras dont even cover her protesters which is bad i like it when the camera covers the protesters because then they finally show how many people we have at these things her protesters have so little enthusiasm for her and theyre so boring that the cameras dont follow them so its sad when you think about it  i like the bernie protesters better they had enthusiasm by the way a reminder to everyone here register to vote youve got to register to vote we have a movement going on folks this is a movement this is a movement im going to mississippi in a little while we have tens of thousands of people were only confined by the size  look at this  back to the corners were only  were only confined  we set a record here today we always set records we always do  in four instances for some reason we have beaten elton johns record whos a great guy weve beaten elton john  and he has pianos right i dont have a piano no piano but we have beaten four times elton johns record at arenas together were going to restore ethics and honesty to our government were also going to restore safety to our country hillary clinton  and maybe this bothers me almost more than anything else because i know bad things are going to happen hillary clinton wants to increase by  percent over obama  thousands and thousands of syrian refugees coming into our country  overall her plan would bring in  refugees from all refugeesending countries in her first term this is at the same time we and europe and everywhere else is experiencing tremendous problems not only with attacks but with lone wolf attacks thats sickos that by themselves do tremendous destruction you look at san bernardino you look at wherever you look at orlando you can look anywhere you want the lone wolf attacker the sicko  the sicko  and were allowing them in by the tens of thousands how stupid are we how stupid are we and you mark my words ive been very good at predicting things been very very good people are writing me letters saying you predicted  i predict a lot of things bad bad things are going to be happening with these people pouring into our country bad things are going to be happening bad bad things you watch were going to build a wall dont you worry about it were going to build a wall were going to build the wall and mexico is going to pay for the wall  percent  and its going to be a big wall its going to be a real wall its going to be as beautiful as a wall can be but its going to be a wall and were going to have protection for tunnels so that people cant tunnel under we can easily have protection but were going to have protection for tunnels were going to have a real border were going to have a real wall mexico is going to pay for it mexico right now  we have a trade deficit with mexico of approximately  billion a year believe me the wall is peanuts compared to the kind of money theyre making with the united states and speaking of that and ive said this we are losing so many jobs to mexico and other places there have to be  there have to be repercussions from this we cannot allow this to happen we cannot allow these countries because their leaders are smarter than our leaders because their negotiators are better because we have frankly very very stupid people representing us we cannot allow this to continue to happen whether its carrier air conditioning or ford or any other  i could name hundreds  hundreds and hundreds of companies millions and millions of jobs millions and millions we cannot allow this to continue to happen we wont have a country any longer im going to suspend immigration wherever effective screening cannot take place and i am going to institute a new ideological screening program to keep out people who dont share our values of love and respect  moving forward we are going to start promoting american values once again its time to put the era of division behind us and to embrace a new american future based on our common values and our principles our principles  and if people dont like our values and if people dont like our principles tell them dont come in  i understand that the wall street donors and the washington insiders dont want change we know why theyre making a fortune they want things to keep going on exactly as they are thats why theyre throwing so much money to hillary clinton its the powerful protecting the powerful i used to do that also folks i hate to tell you its very easy i know the business better than anybody i know this subject better than anybody whos ever run for any office ok  sixteen months ago i was the fairhaired way and all the sudden im an outsider it took just a few words  im going to run for president i became an outsider  its insiders fighting for insiders but im fighting for you thats why im doing this  i built a great company  believe me i didnt need to do this this is a lot of work a lot of energy and im spending my money by the way  a lot of energy we are  we are doing well its a movement its a movement a real movement were going to get it turned around were going to stop crime were going to bring back our jobs were going to straighten out our inner cities were going to do a lot of things and by the way we are going to save our second amendment which is under siege  if in san bernardino or orlando or paris  where by the way they have the toughest gun laws in the world if you had this gentleman right there or this woman right here right or that gentleman right there standing there with a gun strapped to his or her side when these animals came in and they started shooting people that had absolutely no protection it would have been a whole different story folks  wouldve been a whole different story and if they had even an inkling if they thought that guns were in the room they probably wouldnt have even gone there in the first place ok very simple so were going to protect our second amendment so im an agent of change i am and hillary clinton is a total defender of the status quo i dont think you can be too happy with the status quo  im asking for your vote so we can create the new american future  this includes millions of new jobs through lower taxes less regulation and trade deals that put america first it includes the appointment of justices to the united states supreme court   who are going to protect our freedom and that includes theyll be protecting the second amendment  so important folks justices of the supreme court remember justice scalia great man were going to try and get people of that thought process that thinking that intellect but we already have one and if she chooses four or five  it could be as many as five could be a record in the history of this country of new judicial appointments if she puts people in that are radical left you have got yourselves a whole different country were going to have a new foreign policy that focuses on defeating isis not nationbuilding weve tried the nation building doesnt work not going to work never going to work hillary clintons reckless policies unleashed isis onto the world in the first place she will never have the judgment or the stamina to fix the problems that she created she created so many problems it was just announced in a new poll that people feel the country is less safe today than it was before  pretty bad poll thats pretty bad with all the money we spent all the trillions and trillions of dollars that we spent people feel less safe today than they did then in the meantime our country is dying our infrastructure is sick our roads are terrible our bridges are falling our schools you take a look at whats happening there our tunnels everything is bad and all of that money was spent it was spent and wasted by people that didnt have a clue were going to change it around folks were going to defeat terrorism and keep the terrorists the hell out of our country  and finally were going to create a more inclusive society where no american is left behind were going to bring back jobs opportunity and hope to every community in our nation every community once again were going to have a government of by and for the american people  this is going to be your country your government and your really great future its going to be a great future the rule of special interests is over its gone if i win if i dont win it will be worse than ever before you will see you will see but hopefully you will not get a chance to see because were going to turn it around were going to turn it around and itll be a beautiful thing   thank you we will bring america together as one country again we are so divided we are so terribly divided so many ways president obama is a great divider he doesnt know how to put things together he doesnt have a clue  we will bring it together as one country united as americans in common purpose and common dreams and thats what it is its dreams we dream of having it right it will be right it will be right were going to have a driving economy were going to have a strong strong strong border that people are going to respect and the drugs are not going to be flowing across like gravy   were going to have a powerful military not a depleted military like we have now  and our vets are part of our military our vets are going to be treated incredibly well as they have to be theyre our great people were going to have a peaceful nation a rising standard of living this is what i promise you lets get out there and

wealthy again we will make america proud again  proud  you wont be embarrassed like you are now with the iran deal or when you see  million being sent on airplanes to terrorists who by the way wont use that money for terror theyre gonna put that money in swiss bank accounts theyve got plenty other money to use for terror think of these people they have a plane arrive with  million in cash all different denominations theyve got it right  million in cash nobody could believe it and it turned out that it was actually for the hostages despite the lies of obama it was for the hostages  he couldnt have been happy when his representatives said it was for the hostages couldnt have been happy you know its like obamacare if you remember  times keep your doctor keep your plan remember over and over and over again and then some democrats they actually voted because of that over and over he lied and he lied and he lied well he lied about the hostages too  million in cash he lied about

57,"Trump","thank you everybody thank you thank you very much  senator governor and rudy thank you very much wow what a group what a group very excited very very excited to be with you tonight thank

thank you for all the support youve given me right from the beginning i will not forget it mississippi we love mississippi right from the beginning right from the beginning  this is the spirit we need to rebuild our country a hundred percent  and this is our chance to break free from the bitter failures of the past and to create a new american future  to everyone watching across our nation right now to everyone who has been let down by our terrible terrible politicians i am asking for your vote on november th  this is your chance to remove the special interests from their throne of power and to once again have a government of by and for the people    no one will be left behind anymore  id like to take this moment to send our thoughts and prayers to everyone at the american university in kabul afghanistan they are going through a lot we must defeat radical islamic terrorism  anyone who will not name our enemy is not fit to lead our country  eight years of obamaclinton policies have sacrificed our safety and undermined our freedom and independence our jobs have moved to other countries islamic terrorism has spread within our shores and an open border has crushed lowincome workers and threatened and i mean totally threatened our security  the issues we face here in america are similar to the issues faced in britain during their referendum on membership in the european union this is the movement known as brexit on june rd the people of britain voted to declare their independence which is what were looking to do also folks   from their international government which hasnt worked they voted to break away from rule by large corporations and media executives who believe in a world without borders  they voted to reclaim control over immigration over their economy over their government  working people and the great people of the uk took control of their destiny  the people profiting from the rigged system and it is rigged were finding it out every single day the multinational banks the media celebrities the big donors tried to scare the british people out of voting for change the same thing is happening right here in the united states its happening all the people benefiting from our rigged system dont want things to change they want you to believe things cant be changed and they can so easily so easily and so smartly and we all know things have to change we have no choice and they have to change right now  before the vote i said that britain would leave the eu sometimes referred to as european union and i said it and i took a lot of heat when i said it people said what does he know what does he know and guess what i was very supportive of their right to do it and to take control of their own future like exactly what were going to be voting for on november th  hillary clinton who has been on the wrong side of history in every major decision shes only made bad decisions shes got bad judgment she doesnt know what shes doing folks  she got this one wrong too   she got this one wrong too folks she got this one wrong too she gets them all wrong she gets them all wrong doesnt she she really got the emails wrong that i can tell you  and now hillary wants to surrender america to globalism just what we dont want  she wants a country without borders she wants trade deals written for the benefit of foreign corporations she wants a government that ignores the will of the people  she wants to sell out american security to the clinton foundation for a big fat pile of cash  its hard to tell where the clinton foundation ends and where the state department begins according to the associated press more than half the meetings she took as secretary of state with people outside government were with foundation donors  hillary clinton does not believe in america first we believe in america first  hillary believes in donors first and special interests and lobbyists she will never straighten out our country she doesnt have the strength the stamina or the ability to straighten out our country well have four more years of obama and thats just what we dont want  she would rather give a job to a refugee from overseas than an unemployed american veteran or to an unemployed african american or hispanic  the job of a public official is to serve and protect the citizens of the united states   not illegal immigrants not foreign nationals seeking entry but the people living here lawfully today including millions of africanamerican and hispanic citizens millions millions being treated very very unfairly i can tell you that my focus will always be on the wellbeing of more than  million american citizens who call this country home and who love their country    i will fight for their security i will fight for their jobs we will not let jobs be taken out of our country be ripped out of our country and moved to mexico and many other countries we will not let it happen anymore  well be fighting for their jobs and well be fighting for your families that i can tell you it ends whats been going on ends on november th  we will have one american nation not divided we will be together hillary clinton has betrayed her duty to the people november th is our chance to redeclare american independence  this is a great honor for me i am going right now to invite onto the stage the man behind brexit and a man who led brilliantly the united kingdom independence party in this fight and won despite all odds despite horrible namecalling despite so many obstacles ladies and gentlemen mr nigel farage    wow thank you nigel what a job what a job he did what a job he did against all odds thank you nigel that was some job that he did against all odds everybody said it couldnt be done and by the way its looking like a very wise decision right now by the voters so i really congratulate nigel and i thank you for being here thank you  and if i may we had some tremendous polls come out today i wont bring it up i refuse to mention it but they were very good were leading in a lot of locations  thank you its time for america to recapture like you just heard to recapture our destiny our government leaders and our media have totally lost touch with the people they have they have totally lost touch you need no better evidence of that then the fact that the media ignores the plight of americans who have lost their children to illegal immigrants but spends day after day pushing for amnesty for those here in total violation of the law we cant allow that  why do our leaders spend so much time talking about how to help people here illegally theyre here illegally and they spend and they work and they try so hard to help them but they dont try helping american citizens some of whom have been devastated by whats happened to their children and their families devastated my priorities will never change jobs wages and security for americans  and the immigration policy i support as president must pass these three tests first it must improve jobs and wages for united states citizens  we have people in this room who were making more money in real wages  years ago were not working as hard as theyre working now and theyve gotten older not supposed to be that way and in many cases and largely because of the disaster known as obamacare they have to hold two jobs not one but two jobs and in some cases three jobs not going to happen folks not going to happen second it must improve the safety and security for united states citizens  third it must improve the quality of life for us citizens the quality of life our quality of life is going down our level of security you look back years youre more insecure now in terms of security than you were   and  years ago hillary clintons radical immigration plan fails these tests and it fails them very very badly her push for open borders will lower the wages and kill the jobs of lawful american residents  her support for catchandrelease will put innocent american lives at risk and already has just like president obama released the illegal immigrant at the border who then killed magnificent magnificent sarah root yesterday i met with her mom michelle hillary clinton only talks about the separation of families who choose to come here illegally i want to focus on the american families who have been permanently separated from their children because of the sanctuary cities and open borders that hillary clinton so strongly supports  where is the sanctuary for american children where is that sanctuary the dreamers we never talk about are the young americans why arent young americans dreamers also i want my dreamers to be young americans  hillary clinton also wants to push to bring in  refugees in her first term   a large number of whom come from large countries where women and gays are horribly brutalized which will weaken our tolerant way of life i only want to bring people to our country who share our values and love our people and are capable of loving america  importantly i will also create millions and millions of jobs for our people  we are going to cut taxes reduce regulations fix our trade deals unleash american energy and repeal and replace the horror show known as obamacare  we are going to create jobs jobs jobs  i will be the greatest jobs president that god ever created believe me  so were going to have millions and millions of jobs jobs like you have never seen in this country before because our jobs are being stolen from us our companies are being stolen from us our manufacturing is down by  percent and  percent and numbers that nobody even believes those days will be over if donald trump is elected president of the united states believe me  rising incomes higher wages thousands of new companies all across this nation theyll come in and theyll form we are going to renegotiate the worst trade deal ever made not only in this country but anywhere in the world known as nafta and signed by bill clinton  were going to stand up to china on trade were going to keep out of what will be a disastrous trade deal transpacific partnership tpp  it will not happen with me it will absolutely happen with crooked hillary believe me this state has lost more than  percent of its manufacturing jobs since bill clinton signed nafta and its lost one in four manufacturing jobs since he put china into the world trade organization both deals supported by hillary clinton horrible deals destructive deals what those deals have done to our jobs and to our country we are going to bring back jobs to mississippi   and in north carolina which has treated me so well and ohio and to michigan where our auto plants are leaving and leaving and leaving and going to mexico and other places and to pennsylvania where i went to school and to maryland and all across this land were going to bring our jobs back and were not going to let our jobs be taken away    thank you thank you and im going to make it my personal mission to bring opportunity safety and prosperity to our very very troubled inner cities  the democratic party has failed and betrayed the africanamerican community  democratic crime policies education policies and economic policies have produced only more crime more broken homes and more poverty than weve ever had in those communities before  nearly four in  africanamerican children live in poverty fiftyeight percent of africanamerican youth are not working more than  people have been shot in chicago since the beginning of this year alone  violent crime has risen  percent and in americas  largest cities its only going one way folks and thats up homicides are up nearly  percent in washington dc and more than  percent from last year in baltimore the democratic party has taken the votes of african americans totally for granted and theyve done nothing in return  theyve just assumed theyll get your support and theyve done nothing absolutely nothing to deserve it its time to give the democrats some competition for african american votes and for hispanic votes  its time to rebuild the inner cities of america and do it properly its time to reject the failed leadership of a rigged political system and i was the first to use that term its a rigged disgusting system to those hurting and suffering and left behind i say what do you have to lose by trying something new what do you have to lose by voting for donald trump for president what do you have to lose i will fix the problem i will fix the problem  if you keep voting for the same people you will keep getting the same horrible results but i also want to talk about what you have to gain right right what do you have to gain we will create school choice and allow charter schools to absolutely thrive  what else will we gain we will empower young americans to pursue their dreams of opening a small business and make it easier for them to get the credit that they need  we will renegotiate our horrible trade deals to bring back jobs and opportunity and the africanamerican community and the hispanic community will be our biggest beneficiary of that  we will lower taxes and unleash job creation and we will tap into trillions of dollars in new energy wealth that we never even knew we had before  we will protect your jobs from illegal immigration and broken visa programs and we will rebuild the roads the bridges the infrastructure the tunnels the airports in your communities and we will rebuild it with our companies with our steel and with our labor  hillary clinton is a bigot who sees people of color   only as votes not as human beings worthy of a better future shes going to do nothing for african americans shes going to do nothing for the hispanics shes only going to take care of herself her husband her consultants her donors these are the people she cares about she doesnt care what her policies have done to your communities she doesnt care remember this youve had her policies democrats running some of the inner cities for    even over a hundred years and look what you have right now poverty no education crime you cant walk down the street with your child were going to fix it were going to fix it  hillary clinton has no remorse i will fight to create a better future for every american the hedge fund managers and wall street donors are throwing money at hillary clinton to try and stop our change agenda of course if they start looking at the polls they may stop doing that  theyre going to have to start studying those polls thats why you need to come out and you have to vote you have to vote  that is why you must make your voice heard on november th have to do it  another crucial issue in this race is national security hillary clinton may go down as the worst secretary of state that has ever served in that office  lets look back at the middle east at the very beginning of  before the obamaclinton administration that i call a catastrophe took over libya was stable syria was under control iraq was experiencing a reduction in violence the group that would become what we now call isis was close to being extinguished would never have happened iran was being choked off by economic sanctions fast forward to today after spending  trillion maybe  trillion nobody even knows how much money has been sucked out of our country what have the decisions of obamaclinton produced libya is in ruins our ambassador and three other brave americans are dead and isis has gained a new base of operations theyre all over the world syria is in the midst of a totally disastrous civil war isis controls large portions of the territory a refugee crisis now threatens europe and is threatening the united states because hillary is allowing these people to pour into our country and we dont know who they are where they come from we know nothing iraq is in chaos and isis is on the loose isis has spread across the middle east and into the west at the same time isis is trying to infiltrate refugee flows into europe and definitely folks definitely ive been very good at predicting definitely into the united states  iran has become the worlds largest state sponsor of terrorism is now flush with up to  billion in cash released by the united states plus another  million in cash cash cash ransom   that president obama said had nothing to do with ransom had nothing to do with the hostages and his own people said he was wrong  he lied he lied just like he said obamacare keep your plan youll keep your doctor  times keep your plan keep your doctor and because of that lie democrats that would have never passed it passed it and now they regret that they passed it because it is a total disaster  worst of all the nuclear deal puts iran the numberone state sponsor of radical islamic terrorism on a path to nuclear weapons in short the obamaclinton foreign policy has unleashed isis destabilized the middle east and put the nation of iran which chants constantly chants death to america in a dominant position of regional power and in fact aspiring to be a dominant world power and we put them there over the last three years  this is the legacy of barack obama and hillary clinton death destruction terrorism and weakness  but hillary clintons legacy does not have to be americas legacy were going to end the era of nationbuilding a disastrous concept a disastrous era and create new foreign policy joined by our partners in the middle east that is focused completely on destroying isis we have no choice destroying isis  we will extend a hand of friendship to any nation that will work with us in good faith on this vital mission i have a message for the terrorists trying to kill our people our citizens trying to hurt the world but trying to hurt the united states we will find you we will destroy you and we will win    thank you thank you this is not only a military fight but it will also require cyber warfare and financial warfare its also an ideological fight we will confront directly the hateful its just so hateful ideology of radical islam and promote american values and american culture and americas system of government only by standing up for and supporting we have to stand up for and support our values can we become a united country once again   a country of great jobs and wealth a country of security and freedom a country of strength and unity the future is limitless all we have to do is believe in america once again we have to believe it can happen it can happen  we will put back our faith in americas special destiny we will lift the burdens on small business which is being driven into extinction by whats happening in our government well create a level playing field for american workers well never ever let whats happened to them happen to them again well establish justice and opportunity and safety in every community in the land i am asking for the vote of every citizen in this country african american hispanic all americans

58,"Trump","first your needs are going to come first the real divide in this election is not between left and right but between everyday working people and a corrupt political establishment that works only for itself  this election is a chance for the great majority of decent citizens to end the rule of a small group of special interests and to return that power to the voters or as we would say to the people  hillary clinton believes only in government of by and for the powerful i am promising government of by and for the people  and this fight which will be a big one we are taking on   lets just win on november the th  that would be the ultimate and thats what were going to do because in this fight were taking on some very entrenched and well financed interests money is pouring in to her campaign by the special interests the lobbyists the donors the people that own the companies that are moving your jobs to mexico and other places these are the same people who pay hillary  a minute for a speech not a good deal  not a good investment these special interests are the same people who own the newspapers that cover up her crimes theyre covered up these are the same wall street firms who paid hillary clinton a quarter of a million dollars each time she delivered her secret remarks that nobody knows what she said theyre the same people who paid bill and hillary clinton over  million for speeches since bill left the office  and who donated countless millions of dollars more to the clinton foundation  but you have the power with your vote  and by the way new hampshire is a very very important state in this election very important  and if i win new hampshire  ok when i win ok  ok when i win just remember this this is a promise new hampshire is staying right where it is in terms of primary its an unbelievable state and an unbelievable tradition and theres a lot of talk of moving you to the back of the pack thats not going to happen its not going to happen so i give you my word new hampshire stays right where it is ok  so you have the power with your vote to defeat those special interests and put the people back in charge once more like its supposed to be this has been a very historic week in american politics the voters have always known that our leadership in washington dc is corrupt and that the system is very badly rigged  a word that i believe i used first that has been copied all over the place its badly rigged and its broken but this week the curtain was truly lifted the corruption was revealed for all to see the veil was pulled back on a vast criminal enterprise run out of the state department by hillary clinton  as the associated press documented more than half of the meetings hillary clinton took as secretary of state with people outside government were clinton foundation donors  hillarys chief of staff received more messages from the clinton foundations chief operating officer than just about anybody else  donors alone that she met with as secretary gave the foundation  million and i know many of these people i know many of these people these are not people that are going up to pay their respects and say madam secretary how are you feeling isnt it a beautiful day the weather is so beautiful these are people that want things for their donation these are people that expect things for their donation and when you follow it out and you see the people that left her office you take a look at what those people those companies and those countries got believe me you will find out it is plenty on top of that bill clintons total speaking fees rose  percent while hillary clinton was secretary of state often raking in money from people who had business or matters before the state department very simple as i said weeks ago hillary clinton ran the state department like a personal hedge fund its hard to tell where the clinton foundation ends and where the state department begins access and favors were sold for cash its called pay for play over and over and over people who donated to the clinton foundation or who gave money to bill clinton got favorable treatment from hillary clintons state department the examples are too many to name here in full and ive gone over i will tell you ive looked at so many over recent days but they include the deal to sell  percent of united states uranium to russia  or the very favorable treatment given to ubs big bank giant it includes  were all sick of it  it includes the exemption of telecom giant ericsson from government sanctions it includes efforts to put a foundation donor with no national security experience at all onto a highly sensitive national security panel that he wanted to be on with access to top secret information it includes foundation donors getting lucrative contracts in haiti all while the people of haiti suffered horribly and are not by the way big fans of the clintons  but these examples are only the tip of the clinton corruption iceberg hillary clintons actions constitute all of the elements of a major criminal enterprise you know it the government knows it and she knows it she created a private  she created a private illegal mail server in order to hide her corrupt dealings thats all it is folks very simple she knew what she was doing  percent she did so knowing full well it would put american lives at risk by making classified information highly vulnerable to foreign hacking and thats what happened and by the way people that do two percent of what she did their lives have been destroyed but she didnt care as long as it helped her get away with her crime no risk to america was too great it didnt matter to her and now shes running for president then to further cover up her crime she deleted  emails to keep them out of the hands of the authorities and the american public as a further element of the criminal coverup she claimed under penalty of perjury that she turned over all of her workrelated e mails we now know this to be one more massive clinton lie and deception the fbi found thousands of workrelated emails she failed to turn over including the new discovery this week of  more workrelated emails she did not disclose what is being uncovered now is one of the most shocking scandals in american political history its watergate all over again its watergate and shes being totally protected by our government our secretary of state sold her office to corporations and foreign governments betraying the public trust putting innocent lives in danger and then she went to great lengths to hide delete destroy and lie about the evidence just like her lie that she never sent any material marked classified total lie lie after lie after lie this is the corruption we expect to see in a thirdworld country but not in the united states of america just imagine the damage to our security to our integrity to our standing in the world and believe me the world is laughing as they watch if hillary clinton is allowed to sell the oval office in the same way she sold her office as secretary of state and she cant help herself she cannot help herself we cannot let this happen cant let it happen we must vote on november th to keep the american government from being sold to the highest bidder  vote to save your country so important so important you folks have no idea how important you are in this room and this state so important and by the way folks if youre looking at the poll numbers take a look were doing very well theyre very well  very well so vote to protect your family vote for honesty integrity and accountability now as all of these revelations have been discovered  some this week many this month hillary clinton has been hiding shes been hiding where is she although i hear for the first time in a long time shell be making some kind of a quick statement tonight but shes emerging not to take the responsibility for her unethical and criminal conduct but instead to make one of the most brazen attempts at distraction in the history of politics now ive not seen what hillary is going to say but ive heard about it and in a sense i dont want to dignify her statements by dwelling on them too much but a response is required for the sake of all decent voters that she is trying to smear the news reports are that hillary clinton is going to try and accuse this campaign and all of you and the millions of decent americans at record levels there has never been anything like this this is a movement we have this was set up this event was set up late last night and look what happens look how many people  its a movement folks like theyve never seen before and going to accuse decent americans who support this campaign your campaign of being racists which were not  its the oldest play in the democratic playbook when democratic policies fail they are left with only this one tired argument youre racist youre racist youre racist they keep saying it youre racist its a tired disgusting argument and its so totally predictable theyre failing so badly its the last refuge of the discredited democrat politician they keep going back to the same well  but you know what the people are becoming very smart theyve heard it too many times before the well is dry the well is dry  this is the year the american people who believe in much better and much more honest politics say the word enough enough  this is the year that the people who have been betrayed by democratic policies including millions and millions of african american and hispanic american citizens reject the politicians who have failed them over and over and over again for  years for  years without break for even in some cases  straight years they failed them and youre going to vote for a change its time  as ive discussed for many days now democratic politicians have run nearly every innercity in america for the       years their policies have produced only more poverty total joblessness and failing schools  every policy hillary clinton supports is a policy that has failed and betrayed communities of color in this country but she doesnt care shes too busy raking in cash from people and rigging the system and taking the african american vote and the hispanic vote and saying were going to do a great job and right after the election its byebye ill see you in four years  nothing happens nearly four in  african american children live in poverty  percent of african american youth are not working more than  people have been shot in chicago this year alone these are the consequences of hillary clintons policies and the policies of people that think like her she has brought nothing but pain and heartache and broken promises to your inner cities on top of that she wants to raise taxes on african americanowned businesses to as much as nearly  percent more than theyre paying now  i am lowering taxes very very substantially she is asking for a major tax increase  we should be helping these businesses grow and expand create jobs but hillary clinton is virtually trying to shut them down she opposes school choice  education is a disaster she supports open borders that violate the civil rights of african americans by giving their jobs to people here unlawfully she supports trade policies that have closed factories in african american communities and put millions of african americans and others all of us out of work  so many people out of work she supports radical regulations that puts americans out of a job and that raise the price of their so many people out of work she supports radical regulations that puts americans out of a job and that raise the price of their energy bills  you all see it  beyond anything that you thought would ever ever happen she supports policies on crime that make communities less safe and that make it harder to raise your children in security and in peace you see it all the time the inner cities parents walking with their beautiful child and they get shot theyre shot their child is shot often killed folks what do you have to lose what do you have to lose donald trump will fix it were going to make it better were going to help education were going to straighten out crime were going to create jobs were going to bring our companies back what the hell do you have to lose it cant get any worse than what it is right now    you know i said this a few weeks ago and i mean it so deeply in my heart we will fix it we will get it fixed theyre never going to do it for you its words its politicians you know what i always say about politicians all talk no action theyre controlled by their lobbyists and their special interests and their donors me i put up my money im into this thing for a lot of money i want to tell you nobodys going to be calling me and asking for favors we want to move a company to mexico please make sure it happens let me tell you im going to make sure just the opposite im going to make sure it doesnt happen i believe every single parent in this country and especially in the inner cities has to right to raise their children in safety walk down the street in safety not be shot at this is one of the great civil rights issues of our time and people dont talk about it that way this is a civil rights issue the democrats have run your inner cities theyre making a fortune for themselves and theyre destroying theyre destroying remember this the people that live there they are destroying those people this is actually a civil rights issue and its a disgrace and they should be ashamed of themselves but hillary clinton doesnt want to talk about any of this she cant defend her record shes got a horrible record and as bernie sanders said shes got very very bad judgment she really does all you have to do is look at what shes done she doesnt have one single proposal that hasnt been tried and failed she doesnt have one idea that does anything but destroy jobs for africanamericans and hispanicamericans and all americans in our country its going to be a disaster her trade deals were a disaster this will be catastrophic for our country  so what does she do when she cant defend her record thats right she lies she lies and she smears and she paints decent americans you as racists she bullies voters who only want a better future and tries to intimidate them out of voting for a change im for change she doesnt want change as i discussed yesterday these are the same tactics the establishment power is used to try to scare the british people out of voting for change also it didnt work there and its not going to work here call me mr brexit the american people are ready to vote for freedom opportunity and justice they are ready to take back control of their own futures you have to take it back we will take it back the movement will take it back together its time the clintons were held accountable for their inappropriate conduct   thank you you can see the feeling in this country you can see by this by these outbursts you can see the anger the anger at what she got away with but maybe she wont get away with it but you can see the anger when law enforcement allows her a free pass on something that was so bad you can see the anger in this room you can see the anger all over the country great great institutions  the fbi the department of justice  theyve taken a hit in our country and throughout the world like nobody ever thought would be possible nobody according to the book game change bill clinton shockingly said about president barack obama that a few years ago this guy would have been getting us coffee thats what he said and weve all seen the cringeworthy comments from hillary clinton which i wont get into here but we know what they are youve heard them heres the central point that i want to get across today hillary clinton isnt just attacking me shes attacking all of the decent people of all backgrounds  doesnt matter  of all backgrounds  who support this incredible onceinalifetime movement never seen anything like it  we cant let that stand we cant voters used to the old game where failed politicians like hillary who did lose to barack obama rather decisively  an election she was supposed to win easily  please dont forget that  where she falsely smears republicans with the charges of racism and other things  republicans then always have a tendency to back down and be defensive and look bad not donald trump  democrats then continued to push policies that are devastating to communities of color and devastating to lots of other communities we must break this corrupt cycle were going to and we are going to break it beginning today in new hampshire  so let me make some very clear statements before this whole country including all of those many cameras back there first on the border the people of this country who want their laws enforced and respected  respected by all and who want their borders secured are not racists if you want to have strong borders so that people come into our country but they come in legally through a legal process that doesnt make you a racist it makes you smart it makes you an american  theyre all patriotic americans  we will build the wall  percent and mexico will be paying for the wall we will build it  percent  i see all this stuff given out over the last three or four days by the media that trump doesnt want to build the wall folks we are building the wall ok  and remember this also i have great respect for mexicos leaders because frankly theyre smarter tougher and more cunning than ours but remember this also mexico is making an absolute fortune dealing with the united states not only on the border but with trade a  billion trade deficit we have with mexico remember what i say mexico will pay for the wall remember  these are patriotic americans of all backgrounds who want their jobs protected and their country kept safe its very simple they want to have their country kept safe i will never apologize for pledging to enforce and uphold every single law of the united states we will uphold those laws for our people  i will never apologize for making it my  and this is i will tell you  for making it my priority but is it your priority also i think so  so i will never apologize for making it my priority on immigration to protect american citizens above every other single consideration we have to protect our people weve lost sight of that  we will end illegal immigration and we will restore the constitutional rule of law it will be restored  next on national security people who speak out against radical islam and who warn about refugees are not islamophobes theyre not they are decent american citizens who want to uphold our value as a tolerant society and who want to keep the terrorists hell out of our country  if the choice is between saving lives or appeasing politically correct censors in washington dc that is the easiest choice you and i will ever have to make  we will always choose saving american lives  we have thousands and thousands of people being brought into our country from the middle east from syria we dont know where they are or where theyre coming from they dont have paperwork theres no reliable source that can vet these people it could be the all time great trojan horse thousands  and hillary clinton wants to increase that number by  percent a year  not going to happen folks not going to happen not on my watch that i can tell you  now on crime people who support the police and who want crime reduced and stopped are not prejudiced theyre concerned and loving citizens and parents whose heart breaks every time an innocent child is lost to totally preventable violence  there is no compassion in tolerating crime and poisonous drug dealing and the killings all over our streets in so many different cities i will work to dismantle the criminal gangs and cartels and to liberate our poorest citizens from crime and violence and poverty and fear  to hillary clinton and her donors and advisers pushing her to spread smears and her lies about decent people i have three words i want you to remember these three words shame on you  when youre like the clintons getting  think of this one  getting  million in political contributions from wall street and big banks  and i think i got  you saw that  and i dont know who the poor guy is that gave me the money because hes not going to get anything for it  its easy to look down on the socalled little people which is the way she views the people of our country its easy to ignore the devastation caused by our open borders when you spend all of your time with wealthy donors and hollywood celebrities who   its easy to ignore the heartfelt concerns of communities about radical islam entering our country when you spend your time hanging out with foreign dictators in their lavish palaces and homes and its easy no doubt for hillary clinton to turn a blind eye to the ravages of crime when she has her own personal armed security force now she wants to essentially dismantle our second amendment i think the first thing she should do is call up washington and immediately request that her great secret service agents drop all weapons let them walk around with no weapons and lets see how she feels about that when she wants to take away your guns but this is how the system is rigged for decades the american people have demanded that their immigration laws be enforced and that their jobs be protected from out of control immigration but the special interests who only want cheap labor have stopped it from happening theyve totally stopped it and theyre putting up tremendous amounts of money for years the american people have worried about letting radical islam spread within our shores but the elites who only want to raise more money for global corporations ignore the concerns of the american voters very simple for  years people living in our inner cities have suffered under the democrats failed policy regime in almost every case its democratic rule but the democratic politicians who only want to please media executives and wall street donors do nothing but expand the hurt and the suffering that our inner cities and our country is going through right now its time for a new day and a new dawn in america on november  we will end the rule of special interests and we will begin the rule of the people i am asking for your vote so that we can break free from the failures of the past and create a new american future i am asking for your vote so that we can achieve amazing things for the american people  we can be greater than ever before i am telling you we can be greater than ever before and africanamerican citizens and latino citizens will have the time of their life because we are going to create jobs like youve never seen were gonna bring our companies back were gonna bring our jobs back and we are not going to allow these companies to leave our country fire all of their workers make their product and sell it foolishly back into our country with no retribution believe me those days are gone  so im asking for the vote of every africanamerican and hispanicamerican who wants to see for the first time maybe ever a better future and a future that begins with jobs jobs jobs and also education education education we are going to bring back great education for our inner cities and for our country we will fix our disastrous trade deals and stand up to the countries that cheat of which there are many we will lower taxes and create millions of new jobs as a result companies will come pouring in we will unleash an american energy revolution we will eliminate jobkilling regulations destroying our businesses  we will repeal and replace the horrible disaster known as obamacare  we will enforce our immigration laws and we will put rules in place that hire american workers first and that includes hispanic workers and that africanamerican workers  we will end the era of nationbuilding and instead work in partnership with our allies to crush and destroy isis  we will keep radical islamic terrorism out of our country we will promote the values of tolerance justice and acceptance we will steadfastly reject bigotry and hatred and oppression in all of its ugly forms america will be one nation united in common we will have a nation the likes of which this world perhaps has never seen before  we will have dreams and theyll be common dreams we will have a purpose we have no purpose right now our citizens will proudly promote our values and our system of government as the best anywhere in the world and they will be proud of it and they will believe it  not just say it  believe it and we will do so without apology  together we will make america prosperous again and wealthy again we will make america proud again we will make very importantly safe again friends citizens and fellow americans we will make america great again greater than ever before thank you and god bless you thank you thank you"

honest government for a change  our border will be protected our children will be safe  people dont talk about the innercities but im talking about the innercities they dont talk about the innercities the democrats have taken advantage of africanamericans they take their vote they win the election and then they say see you in four years thanks a lot not me we will rebuild our innercities and provide safety and peace to all of our citizens  american values and culture will be cherished and celebrated once again but to achieve this future we must break free from the bitter failures of the past of which there have been many and reject the same insiders telling us the same old lies because they are lies and i know these people well believe me one area where honesty is badly needed is on the subject of economic and living conditions for africanamerican citizens in the united states   thank you and thank you to law enforcement and our police thank you  millions of africanamericans in this country have succeeded greatly and their contributions to every area of our life and now  and they have done so much and now throughout history we should celebrate and cherish that success but  but this includes tremendous tremendous and amazing achievements in art science sports music business et cetera it includes millions of african american entrepreneurs innovators and the millions of african american workers in our middle class but  but we must also talk about those who have been left behind the millions suffering in disastrous conditions in so many of our innercities and neighborhoods afflicted by total poverty drugs and horrible horrible violence that we watch every single night every single night you turn on the news and you see the violence and its horrible no group in america has been more harmed by hillary clintons policies and the policies of democrats who have run our innercities for literally     even  years nobody has been hurt more than africanamericans  there is no better evidence of the fact that hillary clintons immigration policy which brings in illegal immigrants and  well that is a true statement it brings in illegal immigrants and refugees to take jobs from our hardworking africanamerican and hispanic citizens and they want those jobs instead of providing free health care and jobs to millions of refugees from around the world that we have no idea even where they come from we should rebuild our innercities and provide jobs to struggling americans that have been struggling for years and years  thank you tonight im asking for the vote of every african american and hispanic citizen in this country who wants to see a better future who wants to see real positive change  the innercities of our country have been run by the democratic machine for so long these democratic policies the policies of hillary clinton  these democratic policies the policies of hillary clinton have produced only poverty joblessness failing schools broken homes and rising crime and its only getting worse they dont care about you remember that they dont care about you they want your vote and they dont care they have used you for decades and decades and decades and they will continue to use you nearly four in  africanamerican children live in poverty think of that four in  are living in poverty this includes  percent of children under the age of six fiftyeight percent of africanamerican youth are not working meanwhile another two million hispanicamericans have been added to the ranks of those in poverty since   not a long time ago in detroit half of all its residents do not work  half in milwaukee where i just left almost four in  africanamerican men between the ages of  and  do not have a job here in the state of washington  percent of latino children and  percent of africanamerican children live in low income households chicago just had the most violent month in  years more than  people have been shot in chicago since just the beginning of the year you look at wartorn countries are safer than living in our innercities by a lot its not even close it breaks everybodys heart we cannot let this violence continue we cant let it happen  it will and it must be ended under a trump administration it will indeed end  it will be my priority to work with communities local police state police and federal law enforcement to dismantle the gangs and to liberate our citizens from violence and poverty and fear  i will appoint the best judges and prosecutors and federal investigators who will make this their personal mission and so many people want to do that  there is one thing which can no longer be denied if you keep voting for the same people you will keep getting the same horrible results remember that  and hillary clinton has been doing this stuff for  years and nothings happened just remember nothings happened to those suffering i say what do you have to lose by voting for donald trump  i will fix it i will fix it i will fight for you as no one ever has before they dont fight for you they dont fight for you  let me also tell you what you have to gain  jobs opportunity security safety great education and many other things  many many other things  thank you this means very much and just so much to me i believe every child in this country in detroit in baltimore in chicago has the right to live out their lives in safety and in peace  in the wall street journal today heather mac donald of manhattan and the manhattan institute just wrote an important article about the soaring crime and it is soaring like youve never seen before in our innercities and the responsibility of democratic politicians for creating this horrible problem  big article highly highly respected person the article is called black lives matter to donald trump  true true she writes that mr trumps call to restore law and order recognizes the right of innercity residents to enjoy the same freedom from fear that the rest of america now really takes for granted freedom from violence is one of the greatest civil rights of our time so too is the issue of school choice what a difference it will make  what a difference it will make we will fight for the right of parents to send their kids to the school that they believe gives their kids the best shot at success  i will not accept and neither will you a future in which children  and think of this  children of color any color in this country are not fully included in the american dream  our whole country loses when we leave millions of talented aspiring americans on the sideline which is happening all of the time we want to give everyone a chance to contribute their full talents to our economy and to the greatness of our country  remember  and most people dont know this  the republican party is the  right you know what im going to say  right the republican party is the party of abraham lincoln  not bad not bad its also the party of freedom equality and opportunity people have forgotten it so long now it is the democratic party that is the party of slavery the party of jim crow and the party of opposition by the way is there any place better to be than a trump rally right any place   nothing makes me more honored and proud than to be the nominee of abraham lincolns republican party and were going to do our job  our party will fight to bring hope to every forgotten stretch of this country once again we will be one american nation  one american nation  we will be one united people and we will have one really great future again believe me  and a great future will be built on these three critical words  jobs jobs jobs  this will include a complete revitalization of our manufacturing sector which has been absolutely so badly hurt by hillary clintons policies  so badly hurt devastated were bringing jobs back to our country were not going to let people take our jobs anymore were not going to let our jobs go to other countries anymore  there will be retribution there will be a price to pay  we are going to renegotiate the horrible nafta trade deal probably the worst deal ever made in terms of trade  and were going to keep out of the transpacific partnership a total disaster and were going to stand up to china and fight for every last american job were not going to be ripped off any longer   thank you the destruction that nafta started will be finished off if the transpacific partnership is approved it is a disaster  a disaster for our country a disaster for our workers we wont let it happen we cannot let it happen  these are very very quiet protesters i will say  i will say one thing when bernie sanders had his protesters out they had a lot more energy they really do  much better they were much better they felt it a little bit deeper in the heart but thats just the beginning of what were going to do for the american worker on taxes were going to provide massive tax relief to all working people and lower the tax rate  on small business from  percent to  percent low and middle income parents will also be able to fully deduct the average cost of child care from their taxes  a very important thing  on horrible horrible regulations which are taking over our country i am going to direct every agency and department head in my government to identify all needless and jobkilling regulations and they will be removed  we will have a temporary moratorium on new regulations to allow our economy to grow i mean our economy is a disaster to allow our economy to grow economic growth for last quarter has been revised downward to  percent a number that you cant even imagine just so you know if china goes to seven or eight percent its almost like a national catastrophe and what they do is they devalue their currency they do lots of other things and they suck more blood out of our country and we allow them to do it folks and they get back on track and we keep going down not any longer and believe me we have the cards they dont we have the cards  we have all the cards meanwhile our trade deficit in goods with the world is now nearly  billion think of that almost  billion trade deficit for the year you really say to yourself who negotiates these deals i know i know political hacks and politicians negotiate them no longer  we will further bring back our jobs by unleashing an american energy revolution lifting restrictions on oil and coal and natural gas and all sources of american energy  this will create millions of jobs and lower the price of energy and your electric bill and every other bill for the american household were also going to secure our border and stop the drugs from pouring in and destroying our country  and ill be talking about that tomorrow night in arizona big speech on immigration well be talking about that arizona tomorrow night  the seattle area recently experienced the largest number of heroinrelated deaths  think of it  in  years  the largest number in  years its getting worse its getting horrific and not only heroin they have drugs now pouring across the border that most people have never even heard of we have to stop the drugs from poisoning our youth and poisoning our community  additionally we are going to stop the syrian refugees from entering the united states and instead build a safe zone overseas  amazingly hillary clinton wants a  percent increase in syrian refugees coming into our country so i thought id maybe do this if youd like you know we talk about syrian refugees we talk about refugees we talk about some people hate our values hate our country and i took something that was a song by al wilson the snake has anybody heard the snake  should i do it or not  are you sure yes all right so this really has to do with people coming into our country that cant be properly vetted we have no idea where theyre coming from theres no paper work you know our government says you have paper work theres no paper work and i believe in safe zones and we have to help people out and we have to have other people you know were almost up to  trillion in debt so we have to have other people like the gulf states  its called other peoples money but i believe very much that we have to help and well build safe zones over in syria and well help the people we have to do that  but if you look at what happens on a daily basis in germany what shes done to that country is unbelievable if you look at whats happening in france its no longer friends friends of mine that used to love to go to paris they say were not going to paris anymore its no longer paris you see whats happening in different countries and you see whats happening in our own country whether its orlando or whether its san bernardino or whether its any one of many different places and i read this and i said its so  it wasnt drawn for that reason but i said this really represents what it is when we allow people to pull into our country we dont know who they are but we know  we just know bad things are going to happen its only a question of when bad bad things are going to happen so im going to read this to you its called the snake  and a lot of people like it because it represents the truth it represents whats going to be happening this could be the great trojan horse of all time did you see today where they announced tens of thousands of people coming in and we have no idea even where theyre being relocated so on her way to work one morning down the path along the lake a tenderhearted woman saw a poor halffrozen snake his pretty colored skin had been all frosted with the dew oh well she cried ill take you in and ill take care of you take me in oh tender woman take me in for heavens sake take me in oh tender woman sighed the broken snake she wrapped him up all cozy in a curvature of silk and had laid him by the fireside with some honey and some milk now she hurried home from work that night as soon as she arrived she found that pretty snake shed taken in had been revived take me in oh tender woman take me in for heavens sake take me in oh tender woman sighed the broken snake now she clutched him to her bosom youre so beautiful she cried but if i hadnt brought you in by now you simply would have died now she stroked his pretty skin and then she kissed and held him tight but instead of saying thank you that snake gave her a vicious bite take me in oh tender woman take me in for heavens sake take me in oh tender woman sighed the vicious snake i saved you cried the woman and you bit me heavens why you know your bite is poisonous and now im going to die oh shut up silly woman   said the reptile with a grin you knew damn well i was a snake before you took me in  get ready folks its not going to be pretty going to be a bad deal going on  bad bad deal and i just thought that was very representative of whats going to be happening  not good remember i said now if on november th you go and you vote for donald trump for president you can forget about it because its not going to happen were not taking them in were not taking them in   thank you thank you very much another major issue on this race is foreign policy hillary clinton has made one bad foreign policy decision after another beginning with the support for going into the war in iraq in the first place which by the way i opposed  her tenure as secretary of state may be regarded as the most disastrous such tenure in united states history she was horrible  horrible look at the world before and after she became secretary of state pre hillary in early  iraq was seeing a reduction in violence libya was stable syria was under control the group we now know as isis was close to being extinguished iran was being choked by sanctions right right now fast forward to the present time after hillary here is what it looks like iraq is in total chaos syria is in the midst of a disastrous civil war and a refugee crisis that now threatens europe and the united states isis has been unleashed onto the world viciously iran the worlds top statesponsor of terrorism has been put on a pass to nuclear weapons and was given a  million cash ransom payment and thats not to mention the  billion that theyre getting back this is the legacy of hillary clinton  death destruction terrorism and weakness america deserves a better legacy  all of you deserve a better future and a country that runs so much smarter  i am the change agent this is a movement no matter where we go anywhere in this country we have crowds like this we have people that love our country they want to see our country heal they want to see our country be smart they want to see our country get better  hillary clinton is a defender of the status quo while our country lost badly under hillary clinton she cashed in big time  made a lot of money bill clinton speaking fee surged while hillary was secretary of state bill was paid almost  million for speeches during her tenure and increased a  percent over the previous years then there was all of the money funneled into the clinton foundation from foreign governments and corporations it was pure and simple payforplay just look at what she did with ubs the big banking concern or russian uranium a disaster relief in haiti  haiti has been a catastrophe and the money that was spent and the money that was missing  unbelievable  and so many other examples but the only way to learn the full depth of her public corruption is to read the  emails that she deleted theyre gone   its very sad and not only deleted folks this was after  this was after she was subpoenaed by congress to produce and not only that she bleached with somebody said they never even heard of in a very expensive fashion used chemical so that nobody will ever be able to see them who does this who does this hillary clinton said under oath that she turned over all of her workrelated emails but we now know that is just one more clinton lie the fbi found thousands of workrelated emails she never turned over and then another  emails were just discovered a few weeks ago now today another  emails were discovered by the state department that hillary clinton failed to turn over these were emails about benghazi it just never ends with the clintons theres only one way to get justice in this totally rigged system and its a rigged system when they did nothing about the crimes that she committed its a rigged system remember that  the only justice were going to get is a tremendous victory for everybody in this room and this nation on november th  a big big vote   thank you thank you in a trump administration the state department will work for the country not for hillary clintons donors and special interest  under hillary clinton its the powerful protecting the powerful  politicians defending politicians insiders fighting for insiders i am fighting for you that i can tell you i am fighting for you  the government will work for

60,"Trump","wow thank you thats a lot of people phoenix thats a lot of people  thank you very much thank you phoenix i am so glad to be back in arizona  the state that has a very very special place in my heart i love people of arizona and together we are going to win the white house in november  now you know this is where it all began for me remember that massive crowd also so i said lets go and have some fun tonight were going to arizona ok this will be a little bit different this wont be a rally speech per se instead im going to deliver a detailed policy address on one of the greatest challenges facing our country today illegal immigration  ive just landed having returned from a very important and special meeting with the president of mexico a man i like and respect very much and a man who truly loves his country mexico and by the way just like i am a man who loves my country the united states  we agree on the importance of ending the illegal flow of drugs cash guns and people across our border and to put the cartels out of business  we also discussed the great contributions of mexicanamerican citizens to our two countries my love for the people of mexico and the leadership and friendship between mexico and the united states it was a thoughtful and substantive conversation and it will go on for awhile and in the end were all going to win both countries were all going to win  this is the first of what i expect will be many many conversations and in a trump administration were going to go about creating a new relationship between our two countries but its going to be a fair relationship we want fairness  but to fix our immigration system we must change our leadership in washington and we must change it quickly sadly sadly there is no other way the truth is our immigration system is worse than anybody ever realized but the facts arent known because the media wont report on them the politicians wont talk about them and the special interests spend a lot of money trying to cover them up because they are making an absolute fortune thats the way it is today on a very complicated and very difficult subject you will get the truth the fundamental problem with the immigration system in our country is that it serves the needs of wealthy donors political activists and powerful powerful politicians its all you can do thank you thank you  let me tell you who it does not serve it does not serve you the american people doesnt serve you when politicians talk about immigration reform they usually mean the following amnesty open borders lower wages immigration reform should mean something else entirely it should mean improvements to our laws and policies to make life better for american citizens  thank you but if were going to make our immigration system work then we have to be prepared to talk honestly and without fear about these important and very sensitive issues for instance we have to listen to the concerns that working people our forgotten working people have over the record pace of immigration and its impact on their jobs wages housing schools tax bills and general living conditions these are valid concerns expressed by decent and patriotic citizens from all backgrounds all over we also have to be honest about the fact that not everyone who seeks to join our country will be able to successfully assimilate sometimes its just not going to work out its our right as a sovereign nation to chose immigrants that we think are the likeliest to thrive and flourish and love us  then there is the issue of security countless innocent american lives have been stolen because our politicians have failed in their duty to secure our borders and enforce our laws like they have to be enforced i have met with many of the great parents who lost their children to sanctuary cities and open borders so many people so many many people so sad they will be joining me on this stage in a little while and i look forward to introducing these are amazing amazing people countless americans who have died in recent years would be alive today if not for the open border policies of this administration and the administration that causes this horrible horrible thought process called hillary clinton  this includes incredible americans like  year old sarah root the man who killed her arrived at the border entered federal custody and then was released into the us think of it into the us community under the policies of the white house barack obama and hillary clinton weak weak policies weak and foolish policies he was released again after the crime and now hes out there at large sarah had graduated from college with a  top student in her class one day before her death also among the victims of the obamaclinton openborder policy was grant ronnebeck a yearold convenience store clerk and a really good guy from mesa arizona a lot of you have known about grant he was murdered by an illegal immigrant gang member previously convicted of burglary who had also been released from federal custody and they knew it was going to happen again another victim is kate steinle gunned down in the sanctuary city of san francisco by an illegal immigrant deported five previous times and they knew he was no good then there is the case of yearold earl olander who was brutally beaten and left to bleed to death in his home  years old and defenseless the perpetrators were illegal immigrants with criminal records a mile long who did not meet obama administration standards for removal and they knew it was going to happen in california a yearold air force veteran a great woman according to everybody that knew her marilyn pharis was sexually assaulted and beaten to death with a hammer her killer had been arrested on multiple occasions but was never ever deported despite the fact that everybody wanted him out a  report from the government accountability office found that illegal immigrants and other noncitizens in our prisons and jails together had around  homicide arrests to their names  on top of that illegal immigration costs our country more than  billion a year and this is what we get for the money we are going to spend on illegal immigration over the next  years we could provide  million atrisk students with a school voucher which so many people are wanting while there are many illegal immigrants in our country who are good people many many this doesnt change the fact that most illegal immigrants are lower skilled workers with less education who compete directly against vulnerable american workers and that these illegal workers draw much more out from the system than they can ever possibly pay back and theyre hurting a lot of our people that cannot get jobs under any circumstances but these facts are never reported instead the media and my opponent discuss one thing and only one thing the needs of people living here illegally in many cases by the way theyre treated better than our vets not going to happen anymore folks november th not going to happen anymore    the truth is the central issue is not the needs of the  million illegal immigrants or however many there may be  and honestly weve been hearing that number for years its always  million our government has no idea it could be  million it could be  million they have no idea what the number is frankly our government has no idea what theyre doing on many many fronts folks  but whatever the number thats never really been the central issue it will never be a central issue it doesnt matter from that standpoint anyone who tells you that the core issue is the needs of those living here illegally has simply spent too much time in washington  only the out of touch media elites think the biggest problems facing america  you know this this is what they talk about facing american society today is that there are  million illegal immigrants who dont have legal status and they also think the biggest thing and you know this its not nuclear and its not isis its not russia its not china its global warming to all the politicians donors and special interests hear these words from me and all of you today there is only one core issue in the immigration debate and that issue is the well being of the american people  nothing even comes a close second hillary clinton for instance talks constantly about her fears that families will be separated but shes not talking about the american families who have been permanently separated from their loved ones because of a preventable homicide because of a preventable death because of murder no shes only talking about families who come here in violation of the law we will treat everyone living or residing in our country with great dignity so important we will be fair just and compassionate to all but our greatest compassion must be for our american citizens  thank you president obama and hillary clinton have engaged in gross dereliction of duty by surrendering the safety of the american people to open borders and you know it better than anybody right here in arizona you know it president obama and hillary clinton support sanctuary cities they support catch and release on the border they support visa overstays they support the release of dangerous dangerous dangerous criminals from detention and they support unconstitutional executive amnesty hillary clinton has pledged amnesty in her first  days and her plan will provide obamacare social security and medicare for illegal immigrants breaking the federal budget on top of that she promises uncontrolled lowskilled immigration that continues to reduce jobs and wages for american workers and especially for africanamerican and hispanic workers within our country our citizens  most incredibly because to me this is unbelievable we have no idea who these people are where they come from i always say trojan horse watch whats going to happen folks its not going to be pretty this includes her plan to bring in  new refugees from syria and that region over a short period of time and even yesterday when you were watching the news you saw thousands and thousands of people coming in from syria what is wrong with our politicians our leaders if we can call them that what the hell are we doing  hard to believe hard to believe now that youve heard about hillary clintons plan about which she has not answered a single question let me tell you about my plan and do you notice   and do you notice all the time for weeks and weeks of debating my plan debating talking about it what about this what about that they never even mentioned her plan on immigration because she doesnt want to get into the quagmire its a tough one she doesnt know what shes doing except open borders and let everybody come in and destroy our country by the way  while hillary clinton meets only with donors and lobbyists my plan was crafted with the input from federal immigration offices very great people among the top immigration experts anywhere in this country who represent workers not corporations very important to us i also worked with lawmakers whove led on this issue on behalf of american citizens for many years and most importantly ive met with the people directly impacted by these policies so important number one are you ready are you ready  we will build a great wall along the southern border  and mexico will pay for the wall  one hundred percent they dont know it yet but theyre going to pay for it and theyre great people and great leaders but theyre going to pay for the wall on day one we will begin working on intangible physical tall power beautiful southern border wall  we will use the best technology including above and below ground sensors thats the tunnels remember that above and below  above and below ground sensors towers aerial surveillance and manpower to supplement the wall find and dislocate tunnels and keep out criminal cartels and mexico you know that will work with us i really believe it mexico will work with us i absolutely believe it and especially after meeting with their wonderful wonderful president today i really believe they want to solve this problem along with us and im sure they will  number two we are going to end catch and release we catch them oh go ahead we catch them go ahead  under my administration anyone who illegally crosses the border will be detained until they are removed out of our country and back to the country from which they came   and theyll be brought great distances were not dropping them right across they learned that president eisenhower theyd drop them across right across and theyd come back and across then when they flew them to a long distance all of a sudden that was the end we will take them great distances but we will take them to the country where they came from ok number three number three this is the one i think its so great its hard to believe people dont even talk about it zero tolerance for criminal aliens zero zero   zero they dont come in here they dont come in here according to federal data there are at least  million  million think of it criminal aliens now inside of our country  million people criminal aliens we will begin moving them out day one as soon as i take office day one in joint operation with local state and federal law enforcement now just so you understand the police who we all respect  say hello to the police boy they dont get the credit they deserve i can tell you theyre great people but the police and law enforcement they know who these people are they live with these people they get mocked by these people they cant do anything about these people and they want to they know who these people are day one my first hour in office those people are gone   and you can call it deported if you want the press doesnt like that term you can call it whatever the hell you want theyre gone beyond the  million and there are vast numbers of additional criminal illegal immigrants who have fled but their days have run out in this country the crime will stop theyre going to be gone it will be over   theyre going out theyre going out fast moving forward we will issue detainers for illegal immigrants who are arrested for any crime whatsoever and they will be placed into immediate removal proceedings if we even have to do that we will terminate the obama administrations deadly and it is deadly nonenforcement policies that allow thousands of criminal aliens to freely roam our streets walk around do whatever they want to do crime all over the place thats over thats over folks thats over since  alone the obama administration has allowed  criminal aliens to return back into united states communities these are individuals encountered or identified by ice but who were not detained or processed for deportation because it wouldnt have been politically correct my plan also includes cooperating closely with local jurisdictions to remove criminal aliens immediately we will restore the highly successful secure communities program good program we will expand and revitalize the popular  partnerships which will help to identify hundreds of thousands of deportable aliens in local jails that we dont even know about  both of these programs have been recklessly gutted by this administration and those were programs that worked this is yet one more area where we are headed in a totally opposite direction theres no common sense theres no brain power in our administration by our leader or our leaders none none none on my first day in office i am also going to ask congress to pass kates law named for kate steinle  to ensure that criminal aliens convicted of illegal reentry receive strong mandatory minimum sentences strong and then we get them out another reform im proposing is the passage of legislation named for detective michael davis and deputy sheriff danny oliver to law enforcement officers recently killed by a previously deported illegal immigrant the davisoliver bill will enhance cooperation with state and local authorities to ensure that criminal immigrants and terrorists are swiftly really swiftly identified and removed and they will go face believe me theyre going to go were going to triple the number of ice deportation officers  within ice i am going to create a new special deportation task force focused on identifying and quickly removing the most dangerous criminal illegal immigrants in america who have evaded justice just like hillary clinton has evaded justice ok  maybe theyll be able to deport her  the local police who know every one of these criminals and they know each and every one by name by crime where they live they will work so fast and our local police will be so happy that they dont have to be abused by these thugs anymore theres no great mystery to it theyve put up with it for years and no finally we will turn the tables and law enforcement and our police will be allowed to clear up this dangerous and threatening mess were also going to hire  more border patrol agents  who gave me their endorsement  gave me their endorsement and put more of them on the border instead of behind desks which is good we will expand the number of border patrol stations significantly ive had a chance to spend time with these incredible law enforcement officers and i want to take a moment to thank them what they do is incredible  and getting their endorsement means so much to me more to me really than i can say means so much first time theyve ever endorsed a presidential candidate number four block funding for sanctuary cities we block the funding no more funds  we will end the sanctuary cities that have resulted in so many needless deaths cities that refuse to cooperate with federal authorities will not receive taxpayer dollars and we will work with congress to pass legislation to protect those jurisdictions that do assist federal authorities  number five cancel unconstitutional executive orders and enforce all immigration laws  we will immediately terminate president obamas two illegal executive amnesties in which he defied federal law and the constitution to give amnesty to approximately five million illegal immigrants five million   and how about all the millions that are waiting on line going through the process legally so unfair hillary clinton has pledged to keep both of these illegal amnesty programs including the  amnesty which has been blocked by the united states supreme court great clinton has also pledged to add a third executive amnesty and by the way folks she will be a disaster for our country a disaster in so many other ways and dont forget the supreme court of the united states dont forget that when you go to vote on november  and dont forget your second amendment and dont forget the repeal and replacement of obamacare  and dont forget building up our depleted military and dont forget taking care of our vets dont forget our vets they have been forgotten  clintons plan would trigger a constitutional crisis unlike almost anything we have ever seen before in effect she would be abolishing the lawmaking powers of congress in order to write her own laws from the oval office and you see what bad judgment she has she has seriously bad judgment   can you imagine in a trump administration all immigration laws will be enforced will be enforced as with any law enforcement activity we will set priorities but unlike this administration no one will be immune or exempt from enforcement and ice and border patrol officers will be allowed to do their jobs the way their jobs are supposed to be done  anyone who has entered the united states illegally is subject to deportation that is what it means to have laws and to have a country otherwise we dont have a country our enforcement priorities will include removing criminals gang members security threats visa overstays public charges that is those relying on public welfare or straining the safety net along with millions of recent illegal arrivals and overstays whove come here under this current corrupt administration  number six we are going to suspend the issuance of visas to any place where adequate screening cannot occur  according to data provided by the senate subcommittee on immigration and the national interest between  and the end of  at least  foreign born individuals were convicted in terror cases inside the united states and even right now the largest number of people are under investigation for exactly this that weve ever had in the history of our country our country is a mess we dont even know what to look for anymore folks our country has to straighten out and we have to straighten out fast the number is likely higher but the administration refuses to provide this information even to congress as soon as i enter office i am going to ask the department of state which has been brutalized by hillary clinton brutalized   homeland security and the department of justice to begin a comprehensive review of these cases in order to develop a list of regions and countries from which immigration must be suspended until proven and effective vetting mechanisms can be put in place i call it extreme vetting right extreme vetting i want extreme its going to be so tough and if somebody comes in thats fine but theyre going to be good its extreme and if people dont like it weve got have a country folks got to have a country countries in which immigration will be suspended would include places like syria and libya and we are going to stop the tens of thousands of people coming in from syria we have no idea who they are where they come from theres no documentation theres no paperwork its going to end badly folks its going to end very very badly for the price of resettling one refugee in the united states  could be resettled in a safe zone in their home region which i agree with  percent we have to build safe zones and well get the money from gulf states we dont want to put up the money we owe almost  trillion doubled since obama took office our national debt but we will get the money from gulf states and others well supervise it well build safe zones which is something that i think all of us want to see another reform involves new screening tests for all applicants that include and this is so important especially if you get the right people and we will get the right people an ideological certification to make sure that those we are admitting to our country share our values and love our people  thank you were very proud of our country arent we really with all its going through were very proud of our country for instance in the last five years weve admitted nearly  immigrants from iraq and afghanistan and these two countries according to pew research a majority of residents say that the barbaric practice of honor killings against women are often or sometimes justified thats what they say  thats what they say theyre justified right and were admitting them to our country applicants will be asked their views about honor killings about respect for women and gays and minorities attitudes on radical islam which our president refuses to say and many other topics as part of this vetting procedure and if we have the right people doing it believe me very very few will slip through the cracks hopefully none  number seven we will insure that other countries take their people back when they order them deported  there are at least  countries that refuse to take their people back after theyve been ordered to leave the united states including large numbers of violent criminals they wont take them back so we say ok well keep them not going to happen with me not going to happen with me  due to a supreme court decision if these violent offenders cannot be sent home our law enforcement officers have to release them into your communities  and by the way the results are horrific horrific there are often terrible consequences such as casey chadwicks tragic death in connecticut just last year yet despite the existence of a law that commands the secretary of state to stop issuing visas to these countries  secretary hillary clinton ignored this law and refused to use this powerful tool to bring nations into compliance and they would comply if we would act properly in other words if we had leaders that knew what they were doing which we dont the result of her misconduct was the release of thousands and thousands of dangerous criminal aliens who should have been sent home to their countries instead we have them all over the place probably a couple in this room as a matter of fact but i hope not according to a report for the boston globe from the year  to  nearly  criminal aliens were released back into us communities because their home countries would not under any circumstances take them back hard to believe with the power we have hard to believe were like the big bully that keeps getting beat up you ever see that the big bully that keeps getting beat up these  release occurred on hillary clintons watch she had the power and the duty to stop it cold and she decided she would not do it and arizona knows better than most exactly what im talking about  those released include individuals convicted of killings sexual assaults and some of the most heinous crimes imaginable the boston globe writes that a globe review of  criminals released in new england from  to  found that as many as  percent committed new offenses including rape attempted murder and child molestation we take them we take them number eight we will finally complete the biometric entryexit visa tracking system which we need desperately for years congress has required biometric entryexit visa tracking systems but it has never been completed the politicians are all talk no action never happens never happens hillary clinton all talk unfortunately when there is action its always the wrong decision you ever notice in my administration we will ensure that this system is in place and i will tell you it will be on land it will be on sea it will be in air we will have a proper tracking system approximately half of new illegal immigrants came on temporary visas and then never ever left why should the nobodys telling them to leave stay as long as you want well take care of you beyond violating our laws visa overstays pose  and they really are a big problem pose a substantial threat to national security the  commission said that this tracking system would be a high priority and would have assisted law enforcement and intelligence officials in august and september in  in conducting a search for two of the  hijackers that were in the united states expired visas and you know what that would have meant what that could have meant wouldnt that have been wonderful right what that could have meant last year alone nearly half a million individuals overstayed their temporary visas removing these overstays will be a top priority of my administration  if people around the world believe they can just come on a temporary visa and never ever leave the obamaclinton policy thats what it is then we have a completely open border and we no longer have a country we must send a message that visa expiration dates will be strongly enforced number nine we will turn off the jobs and benefits magnet  we will ensure that everify is used to the fullest extent possible under existing law and we will work with congress to strengthen and expand its use across the country immigration law doesnt exist for the purpose of keeping criminals out it exists to protect all aspects of american life the work site the welfare office the education system and everything else that is why immigration limits are established in the first place if we only enforced the laws against crime then we have an open border to the entire world we will enforce all of our immigration laws  and the same goes for government benefits the center for immigration studies estimates that  percent of households headed by illegal immigrants use some form of cash or noncash welfare programs like food stamps or housing assistance tremendous costs by the way to our country tremendous costs this directly violates the federal public charge law designed to protect the united states treasury those who abuse our welfare system will be priorities for immediate removal  number  we will reform legal immigration to serve the best interests of america and its workers the forgotten people workers were going to take care of our workers and by the way and by the way were going to make great trade deals were going to renegotiate trade deals were going to bring our jobs back home were going to bring our jobs back home we have the most incompetently worked trade deals ever negotiated probably in the history of the world and that starts with nafta and now they want to go tpp one of the great disasters were going to bring our jobs back home and if companies want to leave arizona and if they want to leave other states theres going to be a lot of trouble for them its not going to be so easy there will be consequence remember that there will be consequence theyre not going to be leaving go to another country make the product sell it into the united states and all we end up with is no taxes and total unemployment its not going to happen there will be consequences  weve admitted  million immigrants to the united states between  and  many of these arrivals have greatly enriched our country so true but we now have an obligation to them and to their children to control future immigration as we are following if you think previous immigration waves weve had some big waves and tremendously positive things have happened incredible things have happened to ensure assimilation we want to ensure that it works assimilation an important word integration and upward mobility  within just a few years immigration as a share of national population is set to break all historical records the time has come for a new immigration commission to develop a new set of reforms to our legal immigration system in order to achieve the following goals to keep immigration levels measured by population share within historical norms to select immigrants based on their likelihood of success in us society and their ability to be financially self sufficient  we take anybody come on in anybody just come on in not anymore you know folks its called a twoway street it is a twoway street right we need a system that serves our needs not the needs of others remember under a trump administration its called america first remember that  to choose immigrants based on merit merit skill and proficiency doesnt that sound nice and to establish new immigration controls to boost wages and to ensure that open jobs are offered to american workers first and that in particular african american and latino workers who are being shut out in this process so unfairly  and hillary clinton is going to do nothing for the african american worker the latino worker shes going to do nothing give me your vote she says on november eighth and then shell say so long see you in four years thats what it is she is going to do nothing and just look at the past shes done nothing shes been there for  years shes done nothing and i say what do you have to lose choose me watch how good were going to do together watch  you watch we want people to come into our country but they have to come into our country legally and properly vetted and in a manner that serves the national interest weve been living under outdated immigration rules from decades ago theyre decades and decades old to avoid this happening in the future i believe we should sunset our visa laws so that congress is forced to periodically revise and revisit them to bring them up to date theyre archaic theyre ancient we wouldnt put our entire federal budget on auto pilot for decades so why should we do the same for the very very complex subject of immigration so lets now talk about the big picture these  steps if rigorously followed and enforced will accomplish more in a matter of months than our politicians have accomplished on this issue in the last  years its going to happen folks because i am proudly not a politician because i am not behold to any special interest ive spent a lot of money on my campaign ill tell you i write those checks nobody owns trump i will get this done for you and for your family well do it right youll be proud of our country again well do it right we will accomplish all of the steps outlined above and when we do peace and law and justice and prosperity will prevail crime will go down border crossings will plummet gangs will disappear and the gangs are all over the place and welfare use will decrease we will have a peace dividend to spend on rebuilding america beginning with our american inner cities were going to rebuild them for once and for all for those here illegally today who are seeking legal status they will have one route and one route only to return home and apply for reentry like everybody else under the rules of the new legal immigration system that i have outlined above those who have left to seek entry    thank you   thank you thank you those who have left to seek entry under this new system  and it will be an efficient system  will not be awarded surplus visas but will have to apply for entry under the immigration caps or limits that will be established in the future  we will break the cycle of amnesty and illegal immigration we will break the cycle there will be no amnesty  our message to the world will be this you cannot obtain legal status or become a citizen of the united states by illegally entering our country cant do it  this declaration alone will help stop the crisis of illegal crossings and illegal overstays very importantly people will know that you cant just smuggle in hunker down and wait to be legalized its not going to work that way those days are over  importantly in several years when we have accomplished all of our enforcement and deportation goals and truly ended illegal immigration for good including the construction of a great wall which we will have built in record time and at a reasonable cost which you never hear from the government  and the establishment of our new lawful immigration system then and only then will we be in a position to consider the appropriate disposition of those individuals who remain that discussion can take place only in an atmosphere in which illegal immigration is a memory of the past no longer with us allowing us to weigh the different options available based on the new circumstances at the time  right now however were in the middle of a jobs crisis a border crisis and a terrorism crisis like never before all energies of the federal government and the legislative process must now be focused on immigration security that is the only conversation we should be having at this time immigration security cut it off whether its dangerous materials being smuggled across the border terrorists entering on visas or americans losing their jobs to foreign workers these are the problems we must now focus on fixing and the media needs to begin demanding to hear hillary clintons answer on how her policies will affect americans and their security  these are matters of life and death for our country and its people and we deserve answers from hillary clinton and do you notice she doesnt answer   she didnt go to louisiana she didnt go to mexico she was invited she doesnt have the strength or the stamina to make america great again believe me  what we do know despite the lack of media curiosity is that hillary clinton promises a radical amnesty combined with a radical reduction in immigration enforcement just ask the border patrol about hillary clinton you wont like what youre hearing the result will be millions more illegal immigrants thousands of more violent horrible crimes and total chaos and lawlessness thats whats going to happen as sure as youre standing there  this election and i believe this is our last chance to secure the border stop illegal immigration and reform our laws to make your life better i really believe this is it this is our last time november  november  you got to get out and vote on november   its our last chance its our last chance and that includes supreme court justices and second amendment remember that  so i want to remind everyone what were fighting for and who we are fighting for i am going to ask  these are really special people that ive gotten to know im going to ask all of the angel moms to come join me on the stage right now these are amazing women   these are amazing people    ive become friends with so many but jamiel shaw incredible guy lost his son so violently

lets give them a really tremendous hand  thats tough stuff i will tell you that is tough stuff incredible people so now is the time for these voices to be heard now is the time for the media to begin asking questions on their behalf now is the time for all of us as one country democrat republican liberal conservative to band together to deliver justice and safety and security for all americans

61,"Trump","thank you were going to win ohio no doubt about that  you know i want to start by thanking somebody thats been so great hes the owner of this building and he really does work hard hes

these  man ill tell you thats a lot of people this is a lot of  weve been having a lot of people we have a movement going on we have a movement going on just remember its going to be something special and come november we are going to win this state i have very little doubt  were going to win the white house  and were going to bring back your jobs which we have to have back and we want them back soon were going to negotiate fair trade deals that put american workers back to work that put america first  were going to stop the product dumping the unfair foreign subsidies and the currency manipulation thats absolutely killing our companies and by the way killing our jobs were going to stop the foreign cheating the era of economic surrender which is what weve done essentially is over a new era of american greatness is going to begin and its going to start a little ahead of schedule  well consider the start date november th thats when you go out to vote  gonna be a big day november th you gotta get out there no state has been hurt worse really by hillary clinton trade policies than ohio hillary clinton backed her husbands nafta she backed chinas entrance into the world trade organization she backed the jobkilling trade deal with south korea which was a disaster and backed tpp transpacific partnership one bad deal after another ohio has lost nearly one in three manufacturing jobs since nafta and nearly one in four manufacturing jobs since china entered the world trade organization thats really something these are deals made at the top we have no leadership were going to have great leadership were gonna bring our jobs back were gonna open new companies youre gonna be so proud of your country once again  our trade deficit in goods with the world is now think of it  billion trade deficit can you imagine this subtracts directly from our growth our economy grew only  percent in the last quarter a total disaster a number thats so low they went back and they checked and guess what they found it was too high they had to reduce it even further that was last week this is the legacy of barack obama this is the legacy of hillary clinton if you for any reason have a really bad day and it happens to be hillary itll be four more years of obama but worse itll be four more years of high taxes four more years of isis growing all over the place four more years of obamacare going up    percent nobody can afford it the deductibles are so high it doesnt work anyway you have to be hit by a truck and die slowly very very slowly youll never get to use it thats ok dont get hit by a truck im promising you a new legacy for america were going to create a new american future  but to do that we have to stop the horror known as trans pacific partnership its going to be a horrible deal it will be perhaps as bad as nafta i dont think anything will ever top nafta personally but itll be very bad our trade deficit with the proposed tpp members countries cost the state of ohio more than  manufacturing jobs just last year  imagine how many more jobs would be lost if tpp was actually approved  if it was actually approved hillary clinton who called tpp the gold standard would  percent approve it if she ever got in we wont let that happen  well win this election and well keep america out of tpp we will defend our freedom our jobs and our economic independence its going to be america first  my economic plan is going to grow this economy raise your wages and create millions and millions of new jobs for this country here are a few of the things that were going to do and were going to get them done quickly a massive tax cut for working americans  were going to eliminate regulations that kill american jobs and that includes getting rid of obama administrations new antienergy rules that will raise ohio energy bills by more than  percent very very quickly hillary clinton says she wants to put a lot of coal miners out of business she wants to put them out of business  were going to protect our coal miners  were going to protect our steel workers were going to protect our factories  how about factory workers  the factories that we have left  the factories that we have left were going to protect our workers were going to put the miners and the steel workers back to work were going to get your energy bills way down where they should be were going to repeal and replace obamacare  which by the way will save another  million jobs over the next decade were going to create jobs for all of our people and were going to fight to ensure that every young africanamerican and latino child is put on the ladder of american success  and what that means is a great education and a great job  a major part of this agenda includes school choice school choice so important merit pay for teachers and support for our great charter schools and were going to bring your education local folks were going to get rid of common core  common core will be out were bringing it local bringing it local  i want every single child in this country to be included in the american dream another major part of our agenda is immigration security we need to protect american jobs security and safety   dont worry were going to build that wall that wall will go up its going to go up  were gonna build the wall mexicos gonna pay for the wall were gonna stop drugs from coming in  weve gotta stop the drugs from pouring into our states  its poisoning our youth and others our youth is being poisoned people are being poisoned and weve gotta get it stopped and we will get it stopped and were gonna get it stopped quickly if i win quickly  last night i outlined a bold new immigration reform to create prosperity and opportunity for all of our people especially those who have the least we will treat everyone with dignity respect and compassion but our greatest compassion will be for the american citizen    it will be from now on america first  i had a great meeting yesterday with the president of mexico where we both expressed our shared desire  and it is a shared desire  to secure the border put the cartels out of business and to keep jobs in our hemisphere  but lets also talk about government corruption no issue better illustrates how corrupt my opponent is than her payforplay scandals as secretary of state  here is one example of clinton corruption as secretary of state hillary clinton signed off on a deal allowing russians to take an increased stake in a company called uranium one giving up control of about  percent of americas uranium supply to the russians do you know how important uranium is you know what it represents clintons approval of the deal netted the owners of uranium company millions of dollars in exchange for signing off the deal some of the former owners of uranium one gave the clinton foundation many millions of dollars in donations  in addition bill clinton received  for a speech i mean think of this so a kremlinbacked investment firm that was a big big beneficiary of the deal heres another example of payforplay in the clinton state department in  a telecom giant named ericsson came under us pressure for selling telecom equipment to several oppressive governments including sudan syria and always iran  its iran theyre involved in a lot of stuff arent they some of these regimes use those technologies to monitor and control their own people  in june  hillary clintons state department began adding goods and services to a list that might be covered under expanded sanctions on iran and other state sponsors of terrorism during that time ericsson sponsored a speech by bill clinton paying him  his highest paying speech in april  the obama administration issued an executive order imposing sanctions on telecom sales to iran and syria but those sanctions did not cover ericssons work in iran i wonder why a trump administration will end government corruption  no one will be above the law  we will have one set of rules for everyone in hillary clintons world we have one set of rules for her and another set of rules for everybody else  im fighting for everyone who doesnt have a voice we are soon going to have a voice  im fighting for the forgotten men and women of america  forgotten believe me forgotten i am your voice i didnt need to do this folks im spending a lot of money im not having those big checks written like youknowwhos getting spent a lot of money but you know what in the end its going to be so worth it because were going to make america great again well make america great again  hillary clinton is funded by wall street and hedge fund managers my campaign is powered by my money but also by smalldollar donations from people working all across the country who want a better future for their children  nothing terrifies the ruling class more than when everybody and everyday working people give       to help us take government away from the special interests and give it back to the voters  come november th we are once again going to have a government that serves you your family and your country gonna have it  were going to rebuild our depleted military avoid needless foreign wars build new friendships overseas and remember those three famous words peace through strength  were going to work with our allies to crush defeat and utterly destroy

62,"Trump","thank you so much what a great honor and privilege to speak to you today the american legion is very very special so thank you very much i want to thank commander dale barnett and your vice commanders and your constitutional officers you have all done such an incredible job the fact is you are incredible people  the men and women of the american legion represent the best  absolute best of america strength courage selfless devotion your organization and its members have done so much to defend our country our flag and to advance the cause of amnericanism not globalism  remember american first america first youre one group i dont have to tell you to remember it also you know it we are in your debt very deeply i will never let you down  together were going to work on so many shared goals but i want to begin by discussing one goal that i know is so important to you promoting american pride and patriotism in americas schools very important  in a trump administration i plan to work directly with the american legion to uphold our common values and to help ensure they are taught to americas children  we want our kids to learn the incredible achievements of americas history its institutions and its heroes many of whom are with us today i can tell you including by the way two special people mayor rudolph giuliani and senator jeff sessions theyre right here  we will stop apologizing for america and we will start celebrating america  we will be united by our common culture values and principles becoming one american nation one country under one constitution saluting one american flag and always saluting it  the flag all of you helped to protect and preserve that flag deserves respect and i will work with the american legion to help to strengthen respect for our flag you see whats happening its very very sad  and by the way we want young americans to recite the pledge of allegiance  in addition to teaching respect for the flag we also have to make sure we give our military the tools they need to defend that flag and to deter violence and aggression from our foreign adversaries of which there are many we will rebuild our depleted military and pursue a state of the art missile defense we will do it based on those three very famous words  peace through strength  we will make sure our soldiers sailors airmen and marines have the best equipment training tools anywhere in the world nobody will be able to compete with us and we will ensure that they have the best medical care in the world both in service and when they return home as civilians  that will require a total reform of the veterans administration its in very sad shape i deal with veterans all the time we have tremendous veterans support and the stories that i hear are so sad were not gonna have that anymore ive laid out a step va reform plan that you can review on my website here are the basics i will appoint a secretary of veterans affairs whose personal mission will be to clean up the va the secretarys sole  will be to serve our veterans not bureaucrats not politicians but our great veterans  im going to use every lawful authority to remove and discipline who fails our veterans or breaches the public trust which is what it is its a public trust i will appoint a commission to investigate all the wrongdoing at the va and theres plenty and then present those findings to congress as the basis for reforming the entire system were going to get you fantastic service its going to happen believe me  well ensure every veteran in american gets timely access to top quality care including the best care in the world for our female veterans  the veterans health system will remain a public system because it is after all a public trust but never again will we allow any veteran to suffer or die waiting for care that means veterans will have the right to go to a va facility or the right to see a private doctor or clinic of their choice whatever is the fastest and best for veterans people are not going to die waiting on line to see a doctor its not going to happen  the veteran will be in total control  should i have the honor of serving as president were also going to start facing the world with confidence again we are going to uphold the laws of the nation and defend our sovereignty and security and we are going to defend our border  i just came back from a wonderful meeting with the president of mexico where i expressed my deep respect for the people of his country and for the tremendous contributions of mexicanamericans in our country and they have made tremendous contributions many are in our armed service you know how good they are i want to again thank him for his gracious hospitality and express my belief that we can work together to accomplish great things for both countries thats mexico and the united states  we agreed in the meeting on the need to stop the illegal flow of guns drugs cash and people across the border and to take out the cartels have to get rid of those cartels and we have to do it quickly  our country is being poisoned our country is being poisoned were also talking about and talked about the importance of working to keep jobs and wealth in our hemisphere a more prosperous mexico means fewer illegal border crossings and a better market for products made in the united states when im president im going to look at every trade deal we have across the world and see what steps must be taken to protect american jobs and create new opportunities for the american worker the american worker has been forgotten and were not going to let that happen  we will fight for every last american jobs and we will have friendships with other countries but they will not take advantage of us any longer that i can tell you  were going to show ourselves and the world again what a strong and growing american economy can look like were going to give major tax relief to every worker and small business in this country bring thousands of new companies and millions of new jobs back to our shores and unleash an american energy revolution which we have to do we will also be appointing justices of the united states supreme court who  you will be very proud  you will be extremely proud when we name them youve already seen some of the people and the kind of people that we want justice scalia  passed away recently  serves as an absolute perfect focal point he is the kind of person we want on the united states supreme court  i will nominate men and women to the court who meet the high standard of justice scalia and judges who have the wisdom and integrity to follow the law and just not make it up any way they want to make it up  above all these next four years i will be uncompromising in the defense of the united states and our friends and our good allies we are going to end the era of nationbuilding and create a new foreign policy joined by our partners in the middle east that is focused on destroying isis and radical islamic terrorism  we will extend the hand of friendship to any nation that will work with us in good faith on this vital mission and we want this mission to be accomplished quickly at the same time we will change our immigration screening procedures to help keep terrorists and extremists out of our country  we have enough problems our country has enough problems we dont need that one and that includes stopping the influx of syrian refugees  incredibly my opponent hillary clinton wants a  percent increase in refugees from that region hard to believe i on the other hand want to build a safe zone overseas and use the money saved to invest in america  we do not want to let anyone in our country who doesnt support our values and who is not capable of loving our people its time to create a new american future for you your children and all american children yet to come in this future we will have an honest government that includes an honest state department not pay for play  she probably didnt mention that to you yesterday government access and favors will no longer be for sale and important email records will no longer be deleted and digitally altered which is

and responsible federal budget no more waste no more throwing away taxpayer dollars once more we will have a government of by and for the people it will be  it will be an inclusive society one that offers hope and opportunity to every part of this country including our inner cities we will ensure that every child in this land including african american and hispanic children are put on the

63,"Trump","well general thank you very much for being here mike we really appreciate it and we really appreciate all of those generals and admirals that today endorsed me we have   the use of the fighters   almost  and these are our fighters these are our fighting generals and theyre actually a lot more to come but i really appreciate everything from you and all of them we have great respect for those people these are great great people so if you look at the veterans situation i have been so involved over the last yearandahalf and before that in seeing whats going on with the va and it is a disaster and ive become so friendly and helped the veterans in so many different ways but its such a big problem and we have no clue  hillary clinton said everythings working just fine she doesnt know that people are standing on line for seven days to see a doctor and dying mike theyre dying on line and we came out with a plan a point plan and its on the website and youll see it if you want most of  im sure most of you have already seen it but its been really praised by the veterans and the veterans groups and the fact is the va is a  the veterans administration and waiting and all of the problems and you do have some good doctors in there but people cant get to see the doctors because the administration  the bureaucratic workings of the veterans administration are a total disaster and what ive done and what ive looked at  and you know all about the rate of suicide and all of the problems and numbers that honestly are not even believable when you hear  people a day  people a day these are numbers that you wouldnt even think are believable and a lot of it is because of the fact that they cant get better they cant  they have no service whatsoever and its been really really badly handled one of the things that ive done is we allow when that wait is so long and so horrible  and sometimes by the way a simple procedure or simple prescription just a very simple thing can make a persons life wonderful health wise and they cant get to see the doctor  they cant get to see the doctor and we have a plan where if you have a wait youre going to leave youre going to go across the street or down the road or a few miles away youre going to see a doctor a really good doctor youre going to get taken care of  percent or youre going to go and youre going to go to a local hospital whether its public or private youre going to get taken care of and your government is going to pay your bill and youre going to be all set its going to be very good every simple    it should have been done a long time ago   the female veterans have been like the forgotten people and i think it started because it was  you know obviously a while ago there were far fewer and they havent increased that capacity and now you have tremendous numbers of female vets and we are going to do procedures that theyve never done and we are going to help the female veteran they have not been helped theyve really been left behind even more so than our male veterans theyve been left behind and its just not going to happen were going to straighten it out were going to give them also the right  if things are not being done right theyre going to have the right to go to a local doctor or physician or a local hospital and again whether its public or private whichever one is most convenient and whichever one is better frankly and theyre going to get themselves taken care of whether its male or female and thats so important and the other issue thats so important is mental health because the mental health problem is such a massive  its such a massive problem in the va and thats something were going to devote a tremendous amount of time to and its not just amount of money you know the money theyre spending is tremendously  its a huge amount of money that theyre currently spending but there are people that are incompetent in the va and they have people that are stealing youve seen that if you look at phoenix and whats gone on in phoenix where they cant even fire the people they found people that are stealing and found people that are very dishonest they cant even get rid of them all of thats going to change the va  youre going to be so proud of what you have i mean were going to take it and youre going to be so proud of what you have believe me     look shes a disaster in so many different ways folks disaster  i dont even  i dont really even think she believes in herself you know she was brought so far left  she was brought so far left by bernie and the group  and i think were going to get a lot of the bernie people because of trade if you want to know the truth a lot of the bernie people are coming with us  because the one thing he was right about is the fact that our countrys being ripped off like never before on these trade deals that are disasters nafta has been a disaster for the united states  its destroyed our country and thats one thing he got right and a lot of people liked him because of trade more so than anything else but when it comes to immigration first of all she thinks that everything is more or less fine she wants to allow a  percent increase over and above what obamas allowing to come in from syria and the middle east  percent and hes already allowing thousands and thousands of people in and we dont know where theyre coming from you people know because were military people  we dont know where theyre coming from we know  you see the damage that one person can do you just have to look anywhere you see the damage that  whether its orlando or whether its two people that just got married or theyre married and theyre you know from san bernardino  you see in san bernardino theyre getting thrown a party a shower party or a baby party and then a short while later they go and they kill  people in the group look weve got problems folks we have to figure it out and if we dont figure it out we have to be careful and vigilant and strong and she wants to allow a  percent increase you know i was  very interesting i was saying she wants to allow  percent more coming in from that region and the press said i was wrong i said oh whats the real number  so that time it was true    they said the number was too low but as long as they can prove me wrong theyre happy but  percent increase in people coming from syria and that part of the world and we cant do it i want to build safe havens and well have other people build them by the way  well have other people fund them well lead the charge but you know barack obama has  has doubled during his fairly short period of years  hes doubled our national debt doubled it its going to be close to  trillion when he leaves  trillion so we have to get rid of at least a good portion of that so were going to have other people were going to have the gulf states pay for this because were going to build safe havens i mean look we all have big hearts we just cant allow these people into our country until we find out whats going on we cant do it we cant do it very good    by the way you have illegal immigrants  i hate to say this in this room because you have a lot of vets in the room but you have illegal immigrants that she wants and he wants treated better than veterans you have these people are treated better than people that are in this room  you know it they are treated better than veterans and let me tell you folks theyve got their priorities mixed up thats going to change so fast ok thats going to change  good  general we have a couple of people  by the way mayor rudy giuliani of new york what a great man  stand up stand up rudy  rudy  whoa they love him we love what he did he took a city that was a disaster he took new york city and he made it great think of it made it great again right he made it great again so rudy great to be  to see you and eric trumps wife laura is here and shes done a fantastic job  laura has been working very hard in particular in north carolina but helping also with virginia we have some people in virginia mike rabino  and the group they have done  they have been amazing and hopefully we can get everybody registered because we have to win virginia is a very important state we have to win virginia  thank you  ok so speaking of disasters the iran nuclear deal and iran  iran has  i mean were talking about putting nukes into the hands of an ayatollah that says death to america death to israel and they continue to fire ballistic missiles all the time in violation of this deal but iran has engaged in growing hostilities has increasingly shown it continues to have nuclear ambitions and as president what are you going to do about iran  first of all if you look at the policies of hillary clinton and barack obama they have created what will be a world power not  you know theyre talking about a regional power this is going to be a world power they have become rich they have become powerful the deal is one of the worst negotiated deals of any kind that ive ever seen if you look at it you study it we gave them  billion how about the  million in cash that we gave them flown in  obviously for hostages that was the big lie also just like obamacare was a big lie this was a big lie  and   think of it  million in cash and they kept the hostages remember it had the nothing to do with the hostages but the hostages werent allowed to leave the airport until such time and then they came whoever heard of  million in cash different denominations different countries all different money from different countries who even has the power to authorize something like this so what weve done is created a monster weve created in three years four years if you look at  if you take a look at iran from four five years ago they were dying they had the sanctions the  they were being choked to death and they were absolutely dying they werent even going to be much of a threat they didnt have anything going and now theyre a power weve made them a power overnight weve made them a power number one theyre highly threatening to the state of israel they are so bad for israel obama has been so bad to israel but theyre a great threat and theyre a threat to us and theyre going to have nuclear weapons and this path in my opinion is going to be a quicker path to nuclear weapons the deal is grossly incompetent and then i dont know if you saw the other day we have the little boats going out and theyre making all sorts of horrible gestures they learned the gestures i guess they studied the united states and they gave those kind of gestures to our sailors and our captain on the boats and i bet those guys wanted to blow them out of the water ill bet you   ill bet you they wanted to blow them up  and so you see these four little boats circling circling going around you know taunting taunting its like theyve been emboldened here we are we made a deal thats such a great deal for them and they now feel power they feel power remember the sailors  the  sailors who were a little bit off they were in the water so instead of saying hey youre in our water please go over there they humiliated our country they humiliated those  people and this  and the only reason we got them back  of course you would have gotten them back very fast if i was president that i can tell you  but the only reason we got them back was the payment the following day was due a lot of the money the following day was due and stupid theyre not and they wanted to get that but just think of whats going on here we are weve made this deal we just  we made them a power and we also happen to have given them iraq because iraq  you know i always say iraq and iran were very similar militarily and theyd fight fight fight and then theyd rest theyd fight fight fight and then saddam hussein would do the gas and somebody else would do something else and theyd rest we knocked out the one and a lot of people dont realize that iraq has some of the greatest oil reserves anywhere in the world and so iran is going to get whatever isis already doesnt already have and probably take that too by the way what weve done to create a major major power through really stupid leaders  stupidity  is just shocking its one of the dumbest deals ive ever seen john kerrys a terrible negotiator but somebody  but dont forget this was a deal that crooked hillary clinton wanted she wanted this deal this was a very important deal and she wanted that deal and most people dont even get it you know normally you understand a deal you say yeah i understand we get this  we get nothing we get nothing this was a deal at the highest level of incompetence the deal with iran was at the highest level of incompetence  so well  well solve that problem if i get the chance believe me and if i get the chance youll be very happy  youll be very happy    well first of all it wouldnt have started if we had proper leadership because what happened  we shouldnt have been in iraq but we shouldnt have gotten out of iraq the way we got out where literally they announced were going to leave by a certain date i mean the enemy couldnt even believe it actually a lot of people thought it was a little bit of a deception because they couldnt believe anybody would say it it turned out to be true and we should have left a small force relatively small force as much as i didnt want to be there we should have left a small force and really isis just evolved out of all of the turmoil all of the weakness all of the stupidity of decisions from hillary clinton from barack obama  and isis started off in a small area and now i read the other day theyre in  different states or nations twentyeight think of it so theyre spreading rapidly a report came out where they were told within the government that they want to try and minimize isis and minimize but the fact is they know its actually gotten very much out of control and we have to do something about we cant allow the chopping off of heads the drowning of people in steel cages the viciousness the violence we have to knock out isis we have to knock them out good and we have to get countries that are affected by isis i mean a lot of people say as an example russia you know hillary likes to play tough with russia putin looks at her and he laughs ok he laughs  putin  putin looks at hillary clinton and he smiles boy would he like to see her that would be easy because just look at her decisions look how bad her decisions have been virtually every decision shes made has been a loser but wouldnt it be nice  honestly because russia doesnt like isis any better than we do wouldnt it be nice if we actually got along with russia and you could knock them out together wouldnt that be a good thing  as opposed to you know tough talk she tries to do the tough talk and then she leaves you know she goes i watched it yesterday on the airplane talking tough about russia then she turned around and sat down you know which by the way wasnt even played on the national media wasnt that incredible wasnt even played so we have to get along with people we have to get along with certain nations very importantly because it would be awfully good to have russia and others with us on major attacks on isis    well thats it and you know cyber is becoming so big today its becoming something that a number of years ago a short number of years ago wasnt even a word and now the cyber is so big and you know you look at what theyre doing with the internet how theyre taking recruiting people through the internet and part of it is the psychology because so many people think theyre winning and you know theres a whole big thing even todays psychology where cnn came out with a big poll that big poll came out today that trump is winning its good psychology you know  its good psychology i know that for a fact because people that didnt call me yesterday theyre calling me today so thats the way life works right but i think were doing very well and i really think the state of virginia so many different places have been so incredible so i thank you very much  but cyber has been very very important and its becoming more and more important as you look and a lot of it does have to do with ideology and psychology and lots of other things you know were in a different world today than we were in  years ago and  years ago and one of the biggest problems and one of the reasons we have to knock them out is because the weaponry is so powerful today you know in the old days you could have said well look they have rifles we have rifles we shoot they have uniforms we have uniforms this is a whole different war the weaponry is so powerful  and we have to beat them over there were allowing people to come over here were allowing think of it you military people were allowing people to come over here and you know i used to watch the migration and id see people with cell phones id say where do they get cell phones and some of those people had very horrible things on their cell phones including the isis flag and you say what are we doing what are we doing but were allowing people to come here and we dont know do they turn on us are a small percentage of them bad because if a small percentage is bad thats not acceptable its not acceptable we cant take the risk just a small percentage can do such damage so we cant take the risk  so general the bottom line is we have to get very tough and we have to get very smart or were not going to have much of a country left i can tell you that right now  good   look we have a problem its called isis isis is fighting syria now weve built up iran to be a big power iran is on the side of assad syria russia is on the side of assad syria so we built these people up we build  we created this  this strong power in iran which seriously folks you know better than anybody four years ago they were dying they were gasping for air and all we had to do was let them sit for a little longer  in fact double up your sanctions you wouldnt have had  you could have really negotiated a deal how kerry never left  that deal was incredible everybody knows it was bad theyre dancing on the streets all over iran and literally theyre all celebrating you know shouting death to america dumb americans what theyre saying is incredible theyre saying death to israel this is in the middle of the negotiation if i had a negotiation like that id say lets check this negotiation somethings not going very well we just kept going right through he never left the table once if you would have left that table and said im sorry you guys  first of all we should have gotten our hostages back before we started the negotiation ok  hundred percent and we should have said very nicely with respect sorry folks until you do it  and then you leave the room because theyre going to say no were not giving your hostage back say thats ok dont worry about it then you get up you leave you get back to your plane you double up the sanctions they will call you before you arrive back in washington or wherever youre going turn the plane around in midair your hostages are coming back ok not  million in cash that we have to give believe me  and its  percent its   its not like  percent its  percent you leave you say very nicely  i always tell my  you know the story of my father who was a very good negotiator he taught me so much and hed say  are you listening to this ivanka but hed say son  he thought i was too tough with things right he said son take the lumps out did you ever hear this story take the lumps out my father fred said just nice and easy nice and easy just relax take the lumps out and so i was thinking  see in the old days i would have said were not giving you anything you know i wouldve made the room very angry now i just say sorry we owe  trillion we dont have the money we cant do it we cant do it   we dont  by the way how do we pay them all this we keep the  billion but with the hostages you say we have to have it back look our people want the hostages your people dont care their people probably didnt even know  they did because they played up the hostages because thats a sign of you know the big brave iran  so what happens is you say we have to have the hostages back they will say no you leave the room and you double up the sanctions within  hours youll have your hostages back believe me but they didnt do that kerry never walked the only time he walked is when he entered a bicycle race can you believe this guy seventythree years old its true  he fell off his bicycle and he broke his leg and he was out of the negotiation for three or four weeks and they probably did better in the negotiation when he wasnt there thats the only time that he left he should have left the negotiation and doubled up the sanctions and get what he wanted that deal is a disaster for us its a shorter road to nuclear weapons and its an incompetently negotiated deal so these are the things that were stuck with folks but we will fix them   well its more of the same i mean its just another place theyve taken over this was a hillary clinton deal we could have done a minor attack you know he was begging he wanted to make a deal he wanted to do whatever and this was just  gadhafi was so strong on wanting to  you know because he knew what was going to happen but she was unyielding and frankly its a total disaster libya right now you know they have among the finest quality oils anywhere in the world their oil is so valuable so good and you know whos got a lot of that oil right now isis isis has it so we knock them out and isis now is all over libya and theyve taken over the oil remember  ive been saying this for years folks keep the oil shouldnt have been there if you get out keep the oil  and we shouldve kept the oil and we didnt we didnt keep the oil anywhere we got out we spent  ive been saying  trillion for years i know one thing its now  im hearing  trillion i mean you look at what weve spent  trillion to  trillion in the middle east and think of it what do we have less than what we had  years ago its a disaster its a total disaster on top of which you have the migration which is destroying europe look at merkel i mean what happened to her the other day in the election is incredible and i knew that was going to happen i mean how could  what shes supposed to be popular germany is a disaster now france is a disaster i have friends  they love you know the city of lights right i said to one of my friends the other day so how was paris this summer he always goes  he said i dont go there anymore he said its not the same place its a totally  thats not paris anymore were destroying our planet were destroying whats going on were destroying ourselves and you look at the election results from merkel they were so bad and people were saying oh i think shell be ok i dont think shell be ok i was saying  two weeks ago  i said why would she be ok millions of people go into germany the crime is unbelievable the problems theyre having is unbelievable and hillary clinton wants to be the merkel of the united states ok i dont think so i dont think its going to happen ill tell you what i dont think its going to happen    well first of all as i predicted years ago iran is really controlling iraq and theyre in there now and they have  we have just  you know theyve wanted it  for decades and decades and decades theyve wanted it and we gave it to them we gave it to them because you had two militaries that were equal i was saying before they fight fight fight they rest they fight fight fight they move  feet this way  feet this way they go home and rest weve handed it to them on a silver platter you know when i say about the deal that we made for them or with them on you know  on the whole  you know the  billion deal i always said thats one of the best deals ive ever seen not really the best deal is we have given them iraq with among the largest and finest oil reserves in the world weve given that to iran weve handed it to them what weve done is incredible if we wouldve  if our presidents wouldve just stayed home and gone to the beach or even gone out and played golf every single day played two rounds a day  ok which obama almost does but  but i think hes played three  look golf is wonderful i think hes played  rounds of golf or something like that  more than  thats more golf than many members of the pga tour  ok so look its a very serious problem but honestly if they wouldve just done nothing we wouldve been in much better shape forget about much better shape it wouldnt even be close the middle east now is a total catastrophe between the migration and all of the problem  and all of the death and im talking death on both sides folks im talking death on both sides look at the people you know they blow up a city and they say two people were wounded all right you know the real numbers ok the real numbers are astronomical astronomical and we started this whole thing and ill tell you what we are going to solve the isis problem but we have to also get back  and we have to solve it big league and strongly and swiftly but we have to get back to rebuilding our country because our country is going to hell our infrastructure is a disaster  our roads our bridges our tunnels our hospitals our schools  i mean we go into afghanistan and build a school they blow it up we build it again they blow it up we build it a third time its still there barely and yet if we need a school in virginia or we need a school in brooklyn new york or we need a school in iowa theres no money ok theres no money what are we doing what are doing so one of those things    one thing general i have to say the people in our military are amazing theyre amazing the people  and we dont take care of them properly because the vets are not being taken care of and we dont take care of them on the field either because the equipment is old and tired and you know  a friend of mine has a son whos been in iraq for quite a while you know going back and forth to different places over the middle east and the thing that  i talked to him  hes a fine young man and hasnt been wounded badly i dont think hes been really you know very much affected in that way but he said the thing that is most discouraging to them over there soldiers is when he looks at the other side having better equipment than they do because you know we give the equipment to people that we think are on our side and then a bullets fired and everyone drops their weapons and runs and they come and pick up the weapons i always talk about the  humvees armorplated if our young people would have had those humvees they wouldnt be walking around without legs and arms right now believe me  believe me but they take them they just take them so and he said its so discouraging for our soldiers when they look and they see the quality of equipment that the other side has isis but the other side has and they see its better than what we have and its our equipment that theyve taken its a very very sad thing and those kids theyre incredible people but they really lose their spirit when they see this kind of thing believe me   well its not that theyve done some unbelievable things but theyre in the process of doing some unbelievable things believe me i mean theyre very belligerent they have no respect for our country none whatsoever and we have a situation thats a potential catastrophe we have somebody that truly does have nuclear and nuclear capability the carrier maybe is not there yet but it soon will be we have a man who is i mean hes took over  years old i guess or around that and now it looks like hes getting more and more hostile and what i would do very simply is say china this is your baby this is your problem you solve the problem china can solve that problem and remember this  its a big problem china has virtually totally control over north korea but they say they dont because they want to tweak us look at our president they wouldnt even give him stairs to come out of air force one  ok all right and they probably say on that gee we couldnt get them there you know when i saw that yesterday did everybody see that where he couldnt get off the plane so he had to get off on the kind that drop down but thats really meant for the crew and so that when they fix the plane they go up on those stairs the whole thing is just its insane you know its interesting with the president because i saw that yesterday with the stairs he went to saudi arabia and the top people didnt greet him right he went to cuba and castro the brother was not there to greet him and i said to myself you know if that happened id land id hear hes not there to pay respect to the country not to him to pay respect to our country i would say thank you very much folks thats ok close it up boom lets go back to washington  i would i would lets go back to washington and the scene on the airport tarmac yesterday where this young woman is fighting with these chinese people theyre saying this is our country this isnt your country wow wow and just so you understand we are very good to china and i have great respect for china i make a lot of money with china chinas great i dont hold it against them i hold it against our leaders for allowing this to happen with the trade and the trade deficits  the trade deficits are massive  billion trade deficits i hold it against our leaders i respect china i mean our people should be doing that to them but it doesnt work out that way so you know nothing against china i have  the largest bank in the world is a tenant of mine i sell condos to people in china i sold to everybody but  but that we allow this to happen and then we land on air force one  and i was saying in the history of air force one which is long and distinguished these are the only three times where incidents like this have taken place think of it lands in cuba doesnt have high officials to greet him lands in saudi arabia which we protect  if we didnt protect saudi arabia they would be gone ok they would be gone but lands in saudi arabia and they dont have the high officials to greet them  the highest officials and i said to myself thats probably the only time in the history of air force one where it goes into a country lands and you dont have the appropriate officials to greet right i really believe that and then youre talking about a long history but then yesterday they wont give them stairs to get off the plane   it is hard to believe yes   its such a long answer to that question  it could go on for days  phones iphones whatever they were and just banging the heck out of them how about the acid wash of the emails that didnt mean anything how about the  missing emails that were acid washed  acid washed and rudy was telling me nobody does it because its such an expensive process ok  now these emails had to do with the wedding i give that five   the wedding and the other thing of course was the yoga classes right  now look look folks this is a very sad time im telling you for justice in this country its a very sad time ive never seen anything like it never seen anything like it  i mean go a step further how about i guess it was july  weekend  the interview takes place on july  weekend with no taping no tape recorder no nothing and right on the weekend when everyone is like away or not watching and then the information that they wanted was released on friday before labor day weekend friday afternoon everyones away no no this is a very sad situation thats going on here this is a very sad situation ive never seen it like this were like a third world country were like a third world country never seen anything like it but on november th we will cure this problem   ok first of all its not like we have a choice ok you know somebody says oh well we dont have to spend  we dont  were not going to have a country if we dont have  this is one of the most dangerous times that weve ever had some countries are going  are  you look at whats going on with the weaponry being produced or bought by some countries and its unbelievable and were not keeping up so this isnt like oh gee well lets invest it someplace else or lets do this or that when we build weapons were also employing people remember that so this isnt just a oneway street were employing a lot of people and when we have fighter jets  i dont know if you saw the documentaries about a month ago there was a documentary on the fighter jets theyre so old that we cant get parts for them anymore so they go to the plane graveyards and the museums where they have the planes in these museums and they take parts off the planes in the museums and then we have our young men and women flying these planes and they were complaining they said you know when i came in our planes were new and great and now theyre retiring theyre getting ready to leave  and some of them would like to stay but theyre getting ready to leave and they look at you know using old parts  literally from plane graveyards and museums is where they get the parts this is not the united states that we know folks this is not the united states that we want this is not the united states  so were going to rebuild our military were going to rebuild it with  with the finest technology in the world because we have the finest technology we have the finest technology but were not paying for it anymore and frankly were paying for too much and sometimes were going to companies that are political and were getting things that arent as good  you know this for years  things that arent as good as similar equipment thats better for less money because theyre politically connected the companies  so you know im  ive spent a tremendous amount of money were going to announce very soon how much weve raised weve raised a lot but ive spent a lot ive put  i put more than  million into the campaign and   and im going to be spending a lot more over the next two month period think of it were down to  days hard to believe who wouldve thought  this started on june  this started on june th last year and now were down to  days and i must say with your help and with everybodys help were gonna  were gonna do something were going to make america great again you know its about make america great again so  so i just want to thank everybody really amazing people and rudy i want to thank you very much and laura and ivanka for being here and of course a truly great general right here mike thank you  thank you"
64,"Trump","thank you everybody thank you thank you  it is great to be back in north carolina believe me  we had a fantastic victory in the primaries and i love the people and i have property here i employ a lot of people in north carolina  and i pay them a lot of money i want to tell you that right now so thank you everybody its a really great honor you know two people are here tonight eric trump do we ever hear of eric trump right  his wife lara who was born in north carolina and shes running and working so hard to win north carolina november th november th  and im sure most of you have never heard of her but ivanka trump ok  i  hi everyone wow this is amazing no lack of spirit in this room  thank you north carolina we are so appreciative for all of you for the energy for the enthusiasm my father is an amazing man he is a great man and he will be an unbelievable president  i promise my father likes to overdeliver and he will overdeliver for all of you so thank you god bless thanks dad l  hey yall  now you know i couldnt come home and not say hey to all you nice people here  its such an honor to represent a family that i can tell you is one of the best families i have ever met in my life now you know i was raised with good southern values  and i could not be part of and speak on behalf of a family and a man that was anything less than incredible and that is what our next president donald trump is  i love yall thank you north carolina  d  thank you oh boy its great its great we are going to make america so so so great again  and in  days were going to win this state and were going to win back the white house  but to do that you must get out and vote and that means early voting which begins in north carolina on october th in other words start voting start voting this is our chance to end years of injustice corruption and betrayal and were going to bring back our jobs by the way  this is our chance to solve all of the problems that have gone unsolved for so so so many years boy ill tell you many many years of gross incompetence and that includes bringing back our jobs that have been taken away from us like were a bunch of babies and moved to other countries that were smarter and sharper than our leaders thats not going to happy anymore folks not going to happen anymore  for how long have people been saying washington is broken and controlled by special interests you know that this is the year we can fix it  thats because change has come from the outside of our broken system and its a very corrupt system at that we will never fix our rigged system by relying on the people who rigged it in the first place and thats what youre doing  we need change we need change we will never solve our problems by relying on the politicians who created our problems so to every american who has been waiting for real change your wait is over your moment of liberation is at hand    and by the way we have another room like this outside thats loaded up with people and outside they have thousands of people also so thats whats happening  and were going to go visit the other room right after this is that ok with you people  i mean you already have the better location we have to go and visit them right but a vote for trump is a vote to restore democracy to heal our economy and to bring millions of jobs back into every forgotten stretch of this country and boy that does mean north carolina  the change will begin my first day in office number one were going to eliminate every unconstitutional executive order and restore the rule of law to our land  then were going to begin implementing plans for construction of a wall along our southern border  in other words we will build the wall    whos going to pay for the wall   who   exactly right  they will they will they will and you know theyre doing very well mexico honestly theyre doing very well its like the eighth wonder of the world whats going on massive factories massive plants are being built unfortunately the bad news is theyre being filled up right here theyre being filled up by people from mexico not by people from the united states weve got to change it around folks im sorry weve got to change it around and it will change this will keep out the violent cartels and gangs as well as their drugs that are poisoning our youth and many others many many others  but thats just the beginning im going to ask congress to send me a bill to repeal and replace finally obamacare its a disaster  under senate rules that bill can be passed with  votes  not a big deal especially if we hold the senate and i think we will remember they were saying well if trump wins well most of those people are up but im higher than some of them so its very interesting i think were doing very well i have to tell you i think were doing very well the pundits are extremely upset   meaning a republican congress and a republican president can save americans from this disaster in a single  d  very simple and remember the judges remember the supreme court justices of the supreme court dont ever forget it dont ever forget it and dont ever forget the second amendment which is under siege and you dont vote for donald trump youre going to see whats going to happen youre going to see whats going to happen to your second amendment its not going to be pretty the national rifle association nra endorsed me the earliest endorsement theyve ever given i believe  and youve got to get out if you believe in the second amendment youve got to get out and youve got to vote  so its going to be a very busy first day im going to instruct the department of state to immediately suspend the syrian refugee resettlement program   and develop plans for the construction of a safe zone in the region and the safe zone will not be paid for by us it will be paid for by gulf states that have plenty of money that dont spend it because were going to be think of it at  trillion double the amount of debt that we had when president obama first came to office so were not going to build it but we all have hearts we want to take care of people were going to build beautiful safe zones in syria and other people are going to pay for it its called the opm theory of money i love that theory its called other peoples money  and remember the power we have because some of those countries many of those countries wouldnt be there for a long period of time believe me if we didnt protect them so we have a lot of power just remember we dont use that power we dont even talk about that power my opponent wants a  percent increase in syrian refugees over the large number   over the large number that are already coming into the country thousands and thousands through president obama she is running to be americas angela merkel and you see what happened to angela merkel of germany they had a massive defeat recently in the elections because germany has had problems like its rarely seen before and look at france and look at other countries its catastrophic folks its catastrophic i have friends that go to france every year they love it i say how did you like it this year they say we dont go to france anymore france isnt france pretty tough well go to north carolina instead ok i think so  even our great mayor rudy giuliani is smiling at that one but its true it happens to be true rudy right im also going to notify all countries that refuse to take back dangerous illegal immigrants who have committed crimes in this country that they will lose access to our visa programs and many many more little goodies if they continue to refuse to take back the criminals that have been placed in our country  right now they refuse to take them back gang members drug lords we bring them back they say we dont want them so we fly the plane right back and they go right back into our country its unbelievable actually this is the measure that is called for under current law and i will totally enforce it they will take those people back believe me  the secretary of state is required to take this action but hillary clinton refused to do so just refused resulting in thousands of criminal aliens being released into united states communities and by the way lots of crime and even death furthermore i will direct every agency in government to begin identifying all wasteful jobkilling regulations and they are going to be removed this will include lifting the restrictions on american energy were going to get your electric bills down  i will also notify our nafta partners of my intention to renegotiate the deal totally renegotiate the deal its got to be a twoway highway remember that right now its one way our jobs leave our country and go someplace else mostly to mexico and we will withdraw from the tpp before it can be ratified thats going to be another nafta believe me  were going to bring these jobs back to north carolina and were not going to allow our companies to leave north carolina there will be consequences if they do so theyre not going to move to a country make their product sell it without any tax without any tariff right into our country so we end up with a tremendous loss of taxes and tremendous unemployment we get nothing we get nothing and you know what if they knew there was retribution if they knew there was consequence they wouldnt leave they wouldnt even be talking about it they wouldnt even be talking about it hillary clinton supported nafta she supported chinas entry into the world trade organization and she supported tpp remember she said it was the gold standard by the way i dont think anything can be as bad as nafta but tpp is going to be pretty close its going to be a disaster and a disaster for this area she just does whatever her donors and special interests want her to do thats why shes raising all this money but were raising a lot of money were putting out a statement tomorrow weve raised a lot and a lot of it unfortunately came from me what am i going to do but a lot of it came from small donors i think were average  a shot and we raised millions were going to be reporting a very big number tomorrow so stay tuned  in a trump administration we will negotiate trade deals on behalf of american workers ok not for some other country or some company owned by the special interests and donors that give her money for the american workers its going to be now america first remember that and our worker comes first  we will work to ensure that farmers in north carolina have the tools they need to thrive at home and compete on a level playing field in foreign markets and that means negotiating fair trade deals that do indeed put america first crucially i am also going to convene my top generals we have a great one here actually we have a great two generals here tonight one of them graduated number one in his class from west point just like general douglas macarthur general douglas macarthur where is that general where is he tough guy he is  come here general come here number one in his class  im impressed by that general  number one in his class at west point twostar general incredible guy by the way did you see i think it was  generals and admirals endorsed donald trump today and these are the fighters these are the fighters  these are the warriors these are the ones not the political hacks that endorsed hillary clinton two or three weeks ago did you see them all they run you know why because we have no place for them these are the people that have been telling her and obama and others what to do over the last number of years how has that worked out folks how has that worked out  so were going to convene my top generals and give them a simple instruction they will have  days to submit to the oval office a plan for soundly and quickly defeating isis  we have no choice any nation who shares in this goal will be our friend in this mission for years we have been caught up in endless wars and conflicts under the leadership of failed politicians and a failed totally failed foreign policy and this is a policy that could only happen with incompetent people running our country believe me  the same people who made every wrong decision in iraq afghanistan libya syria egypt china and russia are the same people who are now advising who hillary clinton who you said it the same people are advising hillary clinton so im proud instead to have the support of our warfighting generals active duty military officers and top military experts who know how to win these are the tough wins these are the smart ones and know how to keep us out of this endless war the war thats been going on forever and draining our country draining our country our infrastructure is a disaster it is draining our country our roads our tunnels our bridges our schools our hospitals everything our infrastructure is a disaster this is draining us hillary clinton favors what has been called military adventurism ok military adventurism rushing to invade countries displacing millions of families and then inviting the refugees into our country creating power vacuums filled by terrorist groups like isis and believe me there are plenty of people that are very closely associated with isis coming into our country weve got it from within folks this could be the great trojan horse of all time and in  years and  years i dont want people to be reading about it ok i dont want people to be talking about it i believe in a foreign policy based on our national interests that focus on american security and regional stability instead of using our military to create democracies in countries with no democratic history and couldnt care less about democracy were trying to force democracy down their throat were spending trillions of dollars and they dont even want it  we will work to form partnerships overseas based on a longterm strategy of defeating radical islamic terrorism  we will first have to reverse the damage inflicted by hillary clinton and obama her legacy of failure and his total legacy of failure in the middle east russia asia everywhere has made americans far less safe probably than ever before and they talk russia they keep talking russia wouldnt it be nice if we actually could get along with russia wouldnt that be nice wouldnt that be a good thing and with russia helping us because they dont like isis any better than we do with russia helping us to knock out isis wouldnt that be a good thing instead of a bad thing these people  as part of our plan to avoid and prevent foreign conflicts were going to rebuild our very depleted military  and you saw this there was a documentary recently on our jet fighters theyre so old we cant get parts we get the parts from airplane graveyards and from airplane museums we take the parts off planes that are in museums and graveyards and we put them on our jet fighters this is not the united states of america folks this is not the united states this is our ultimate deterrent however we will be guided by three very famous words peace through strength  i will ask congress to eliminate the sequester and immediately reinvest in our military we have no choice not like we can say oh lets not do it we have no choice we have no choice we have a great country we want to keep our country strong we want to keep our country so we have no choice somebody said isnt there something else you could do this isnt like oh gee lets pick a b c we have no choice we have to have maybe more than ever before a strong and powerful military and hopefully well never have to be able to use it hopefully well never have to use it  right now we have amazingly the smallest air force since  the smallest army since  and one of the smallest navies listen to this since   like the cold war we also need to fight this battle by collecting intelligence and then protecting  protecting  our classified secrets  hillary clinton has taught us all how much of a problem we have by cybersecurity big thing cybersecurity we cant have someone in the oval office who doesnt understand the meaning of the word confidential or classified  now i think she probably understands the meaning such a serious situation and by the way today much to the consternation of many the new cnn poll was just released and trump is winning  trump is winning meaning  meaning  youre winning im not winning youre winning  youre winning youre winning the movement is winning because this is indeed a movement folks when you look at this room and you look at another room in this building and you look at thousands of people outside and you learned about it two days ago this is not just a normal situation this is a movement its a movement were tired of incompetent people running our country into the ground    the new revelations about hillary clinton from the justreleased fbi documents make more clear than ever that she fails to meet the minimum standard for running for public office  if she applied for a lowlevel job at the state department today just a lowlevel job she couldnt even get a security clearance based on what shes done her conduct is disqualifying lets run through what we discovered in those fbi documents which by the way were released late on friday just prior to labor day weekend and the interview took place over the july th weekend its important and were hoping matt lauer will ask about it on wednesday night to her when he does the town hall because she is being protected by the media by the press like nobody ever has been protected in the history of this country  me on the other hand its a total pileon actually a couple of the media people have said also in the history of our country there has been nobody hit so hard so viciously so violently and i will tell you so ridiculously unfairly as donald trump im proud to do it for you folks im proud to do it  you know the expression whatever its clear from the fbi report that hillary clinton lied about her handling of confidential information she repeatedly told the country that she understood the classified system then she told the fbi she didnt understand that the letter c meant confidential or even classified in the documents she emailed on  separate occasions  she said she couldnt recall details about her mishandling of classified information and she couldnt even name one step she took to make sure foreign hackers couldnt get into her totally illegal server  keep in mind that her insecure emails included emails about the drone program its also clear from the fbi report that hillary clinton and her top aides knowingly destroyed evidence and covered up their actions after her private server was revealed last march her staff deleted all the emails and wiped it clean using a software designed to prevent any recovery she bleached her emails nobody even heard about it before and nobody does it because its a very expensive process why would anybody thats getting rid of emails that had to do with the wedding and also wasnt it  remember right  yoga yoga yoga and the wedding why are you when you delete   i figure five for the wedding and two for the yoga right so thats seven but why do you acid wash or bleach the emails nobody even heard of it before very expensive just ask yourself then they used hammers to destroy phones so they couldnt be turned over and by the way who uses  different iphones in four years who the only people who use that many phones are usually involved in very very and i mean very shady activity  and now shes running for president  and by the way did you ever notice she never talks about policy she never talks about illegal immigration she never talks about anything all she does is a total hit job on donald trump she makes up terms right she makes up terms temperament  you know what they did they got madison avenue thats the big advertising people and they probably drew like  terms and they go oh lets see temperament oh temperament yeah lets use that one so i have to tell you this i have to say it i think my single greatest asset of any assets i have is my temperament and i know how to win but its my temperament its my singlegreatest asset  and every time you hear it just remember this is a phony group of lying people and tell her we want to hear about your policy on jobs on illegal immigration i want to hear what shes going to do to stop the jobs from leaving north carolina and going to mexico and other places ok let her tell us  because you know what folks she doesnt have a clue not even a clue people who have nothing to hide dont smash phones with hammers they dont people who have nothing to hide dont bleach  nobodys ever heard of it  dont bleach their emails or destroy evidence to keep it from being publicly archived as required under federal law and she got rid of these emails after congress not before after congress requested them think of that can you imagine if i or somebody else did that can you imagine if rudy giuliani did that oh rudy youd be in such trouble poor rudy right its unbelievable folks im telling you in history  in history  there has never been a situation like is going on with justice and hillary clinton there has never been a situation like is going on with the media protecting hillary clinton    lets do better than that lets win on november th ok lets win  hillary clinton failed to turn over thousands of documents then tried to shield her criminal conduct by having her chief of staff declare herself to be hillary clintons private attorney hillary and her top aides told the fbi and others related in the lawsuit that they couldnt recall or remember cant remember anything by the way if she really cant remember she cant be president she doesnt remember anything she doesnt even remember whether or not she was instructed on how to use emails were you instructed on how to use it i cant remember but thats in addition to the guy who set up the server remember him and he pleaded the fifth amendment what are we going to do with this guy what happened he pleaded the fifth right he pleaded the fifth where is he where is he is he living where is he he pleaded the fifth and that was the end we never heard about him again boy ill tell you this is like a thirdworld country folks its terrible this is really if we bring it up this is like watergate only its worse because here our foreign enemies were in a position to hack our most sensitive national security secrets no one takes all the risks hillary clinton took unless theyre trying to cover up massive massive crimes hillary clinton using and you know this she was using state department to dole out special favors and access to her friends and to her donors totally special favors its called pay for play one example of pay for play is what the clintons did in haiti so let me stop here for a second and say how much we appreciate the haitianamerican community in florida and across our country and weve had a great relationship with that community  we send our prayers to the many still suffering in haiti from the earthquake but while haiti has suffered the clintons and their pals have totally cashed in bill and hillarys brothers have signed housing deals in haiti and one wound up on the board of a gold mining company clinton foundation donors have seen the clintons pave the way for their investments in one deal hillary clinton set aside environmental and labor rules to help a south korean company with a record of violating workers rights set up what amounts to a sweatshop in haiti the facility has produced only a fraction of the jobs it promised and faces reports of wage theft all over the place people are asking where did all the money go this november its up to the american people to stop the clintons from raiding america the way theyve raided so many other people and places over the years  one of the groups in america that have been harmed the most by hillary clintons policies are african americans she sees them only as votes not as people worthy of a better future its called vote for me now ill do lots of things and then you get the vote ill see you in four years folks liar many african americans have succeeded greatly in this country we honor and protect we really do we protect these total achievements so many have really theyve just succeeded and i have such respect and admiration for that success but that includes and i have to say lowering taxes because were going to do things for them for everyone lowering taxes on smallbusiness owners to  percent  were going to lower taxes on our businesses to keep our jobs were going to lower taxes on all businesses so that jobs dont leave our country but millions of african americans in our inner cities remain trapped in poverty joblessness and failing schools and these are the worst schools youll ever see the democratic party has run inner cities for    and even a hundred years forty percent of africanamerican children live in poverty including  percent of those under the age of  fiftyeight percent of african american youth are not working they cant get a job approximately  people have been shot in chicago since the beginning of the year and nearly  people have been killed in chicago since president obama took office and thats his home community nationwide think of this nationwide african americans are nearly  percent of the murder victims under the age of  this is a national crisis and anybody who fails to understand that is not fit to seek the presidency of the united states  to those african americans and hispanics suffering in crime and poverty i say very simply give donald trump a chance  what do you have to lose were going to bring back your jobs rebuild your cities give parents and students school choice were going to make your communities safe so you dont get shot when you walk down the street with your child  what do you have to lose nothing i will not let you down  were going to push a new civil rights agenda we believe every american has the right to a safe community a great education and government that protects their jobs not gives their jobs away to foreign countries  this weekend i had the honor to join a church service in detroit at the great faith ministries international it was an amazing experience you probably saw it it was a really incredible experience i will fight for detroit i will fight for chicago i will fight for baltimore and dc and by the way will i be fighting for north carolina that i can tell you   and for every part of this nation and i will fight to bring us all together as one american people  i didnt need to do this i didnt need to do this its not easy its nasty its nasty i talk about the fact that people in the audience  years ago are making more money  years ago than theyre making today in real wages a lot of people dont raise your hands but a lot of people i hear that eighteen years ago they made more money than they make today and today theyre working two jobs in many cases also partly because of obamacare but theyre working two jobs and theyre working harder now as you get older maybe it would be nice not to work quite as hard but i can only say this ive also gotten older and im working a hell of a lot harder than ive ever worked before that i can tell you  true true i will fight to bring back our jobs and that means all those jobs lost right here in north carolina and every other state in our great union  let me quote the same passage from the bible i read on saturday from  john  no one has ever seen god but if we love one another god lives in us and his love is made complete in us all of us  made complete in us imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working toward one people under one god saluting one flag  its time to break with the bitter failures of the past and to embrace the new american future in this future we will and we have to we have no choice its just like our military we have no choice we have to build it strong again we have no choice in our military we have the greatest people men and women on earth but we have to give them what it takes we have to back them and we have to back our police by the way we have to back our police we have to be a country of law and order  and in this future we will respect the dignity of all americans and that means great jobs great schools and great safe neighborhoods  we will keep our children safe which requires secure borders a strong military and supporting law enforcement jobs will return thats right and the wall will happen  prosperity will rise and new factories and plants will come rushing back to our shores government corruption will end and the state department will answer to the voters not hillary clintons donors and special interests  so few people remember but republicans are the party of abraham lincoln and come november th we will once again have a government of by and for the people  you must get out and vote you must bring all of your friends you must bring everybody get out and vote and be vigilant watch whats happening watch whats happening because were going to win north carolina were going to win a lot of different places watch what happens  because were going to take back the white house and were going to make america proud again we will make america strong again we are going to make america safe again and we will make america great again thank you god bless you thank you  thank you everybody"
65,"Trump","we want to achieve a stable peaceful world with less conflict and more common ground i am proposing a new foreign policy focused on advancing americas core national interests  so important  promoting regional stability and producing and easing the tensions within our very troubled world this will require rethinking the failed policies of the past we can make new friends rebuild old alliances and bring new allies into the fold and we can do that im proud to have the support of warfighting generals active duty military and top experts who know both how to win and how to avoid endless wars that were caught up in like the one we have right now that just never ever ends our longest war just yesterday  top generals and admirals endorsed my campaign and these people are fantastic   in a trump administration our actions in the middle east will be tempered by realism the current strategy of toppling regimes with no plan for what to do in the day after only produces power vacuums that are filled simply by terrorists gradual reform not sudden and radical change should be our guiding objective in that region we should work with any country that shares our goal of destroying isis and defeat radical islamic terrorism   and were going to form new friendships and partnerships based on this mission and this mission alone we now have an administration and a former secretary of state who refuse to say radical islamic terrorism and unless youre going to say the words youre never going to solve the problem its very simple   immediately after taking office i will ask my generals to present to me a plan within  days to defeat and destroy isis   this will require military warfare but also cyber warfare financial warfare and ideological warfare as i laid out in my speech on defeating radical islamic terrorism several weeks ago instead of an apology tour which you saw president obama give over and over again i will proudly promote our system of government and our way of life as the best in the world just like we did in our campaign against communism during the cold war   we will show the whole world how proud we are to be americans   at the same time immigration security is a vital part of our national security we only want to admit people to our country who will support our values and love our people they have to love our people   these are in fact the pillars of a sound national security strategy unlike my opponent my foreign policy will emphasize diplomacy not destruction hillary clintons legacy in iraq libya syria has produced only turmoil and suffering and death her destructive policies have displaced millions of people then she has invited these refugees into the west with no plan to screen them including veteran health care costs  and this was just announced and read over the last number of weeks  the price of the wars in iraq and afghanistan will total approximately  trillion we could have rebuilt our country over and over and over again yet after all this money was spent and lives lost clintons policies as secretary of state have left the middle east in more disarray than ever before not even close had we done nothing we would have been in a far better position meanwhile china has grown more aggressive and north korea more dangerous and belligerent than ever russia has defied this administration at every single turn putin has no respect for president obama and has absolutely no respect for hillary clinton sometimes it seemed like there wasnt a country in the middle east that hillary clinton didnt want to invade intervene in or topple shes trigger happy and very unstable whether we like it or not thats whats going on   shes also reckless so reckless in fact that she put her emails on an illegal server that our enemies could easily hack and probably have then clintons team used a technology called bleachbit which is basically acid and this is going to acid wash her emails who would do this and nobody does it because of the expense who would do this they even took a hammer to some of her  phones to cover up her tracks in obstruction of justice these email records were destroyed after she received a subpoena  remember that word  after  after she received a subpoena from congress to turn them over if you do that in private enterprise its a violation of the law she did this after receiving a subpoena from the united states congress in the fbi report she claimed she couldnt recall important information on  separate and different occasions she cant even remember whether she has trained in the use of classified information and she said she didnt know the letter c means confidential or at least classified if she cant remember such crucial events and information honestly shes totally unfit to be our commanderin chief totally unfit   but i have a feeling she did remember and she does know and that also makes her unfit   her conduct is simply disqualifying she talks about her experience but hillary clintons only foreign policy experience ended up in absolute failure everywhere she got involved things got worse lets look back at the middle east at the very beginning of  before hillary clinton was sworn in libya was stable syria was under control egypt was ruled by a secular president and an ally of the united states iraq was experiencing a reduction in violence the group that would become what is now called isis was close to being extinguished it would have never happened it would have never happened iran was being choked off by economic sanctions fast forward to today what have we gotten from the horrible horrible made by barack obama and secretary clinton libya is in ruins our ambassador and three other brave americans are dead and isis has gained a new base of operations and taking their very valuable oil syria is in the midst of a disastrous civil war isis controls large portions of territory a refugee crisis now threatens europe and the united states and hundreds of thousands of people are dead in egypt terrorists have gained a foothold in the sinai desert near the suez canal one of the most essential what worries anywhere in the world iraq is in chaos and isis is on the loose and iran by the way will be taking over iraq and their vast oil reserves isis has spread across the middle east and into the west iran the worlds largest state sponsor of terrorism is now flush with  billion in cash being released and released by the united states plus another  billion that was just learned about last evening in cash ransom payments we thought it was  million it turns out that its now  billion in cash in other words our country was blackmailed and extorted into paying this unheard of amount of money as ransom and our president lied to us worst of all the nuclear deal puts iran the number one state sponsor of radical islamic terrorism on a path to nuclear weapons and at best will go very quickly this is hillary clintons foreign policy legacy  failure and death but thats not all president obama and hillary clinton have also overseen deep cuts of our military which only invite more aggression really we will have aggression like youve never seen before and youve got it already happening our adversaries are champing at the bit history shows that when america is not prepared is when the danger is by far the greatest we want to deter avoid and prevent conflict through our unquestioned military strength we have the greatest people in the world we have to give them the greatest equipment  under barack obama and hillary clinton defense spending is on track to fall to its lowest level as a share of the economy since the end of world war ii we currently have the smallest army since  the navy is among the smallest it has been since  thats  years ago and the air force is the smallest its been since  when ronald reagan left office our navy had  ships when barack obama took office it had  ships today the navy has just  ships the average air force aircraft is  years old we have second generation b bombers their fathers flew the same plane as they are flying right now this is not the united states our army has been shrinking rapidly from  soldiers to  in  to just  soldiers today thats some decrease and they want to make it smaller in  our marine corps had  active marines today its  our ship count is below the minimum of  that the navy says is needed to execute the current missions at a minimal level president obama plans to reduce the army to  troops which would hamstring our ability to defend the united states it takes  years on average to field a major new weapon system in  the united states spent  billion on nonwar based defending in the year  and i have to say currently were spending  billion a cut of  percent and that number is going down very rapidly looking into the future unless i become your president i have to say  this reduction was done through what is known as sequester which youve all heard about or automatic defense budget cuts under the budget agreement defense took half of the cuts even though it makes up only onesixth of the budget so they put it all in defense as soon as i take office i will ask congress to fully eliminate the defense sequester and will submit a new budget to rebuild our military it is so depleted we will rebuild our military  this will increase certainty in the defense community as to funding and will allow military leaders to plan for our future defense needs and most importantly we will be defended because without defense we dont have a country  as part of removing the defense sequester i will ask congress to fully offset the costs of increased military spending in the process we will make government leaner and more responsive to the public  i will ask that savings be accomplished through common sense reforms that eliminate government waste and budget gimmicks and that protect absolutely protect hardearned benefits for americas governmentwide improper government payments are estimated to exceed  billion per year and the amount of unpaid taxes is estimated to be as high as  billion a year we can also reduce the size of the federal bureaucracy through responsible workforce attrition  that is  that is when employees retire they can be replaced by a smaller number of new employees thats the best way to do it we can also stop funding programs that are not authorized in law congress spent  billion last year on  expired laws these are laws that are gone spent all of that money removing just  percent of that will reduce spending by almost  billion over a tenyear period the military will not be exempt either the military bureaucracy will have to be trimmed down we have to create that strength and sometimes we have to reduce bureaucracy it just gets in our way  early in my term i will also be requesting that all nato nations promptly pay their bills which many are not now doing  only five nato countries including the united states are currently meeting their minimum requirement to spend  percent of gdp on defense they understand it they know they have to do it they can afford to do it they have no respect for our leadership they have no respect for our country they will do it theyll be happy to do it they will be happy to do it  additionally i will be respectfully asking countries such as germany japan south korea saudi arabia to pay more for the tremendous security we provide them  and theyll fully understand theyre economic behemoths theyre tremendously successful countries but were subsidizing them for billions and billions of dollars i think theyll fully understand finally we will have at our disposal additional revenues from unleashing american energy the institute for energy research cites a shortrun figure of as much as  billion annually from increased energy production tremendous amounts of money  tremendous numbers of jobs and tremendous amounts of money and your electric bills will go down theres something nice about that  using these new funds i will ask my secretary of defense to propose a new defense budget to meet the following longterm goals we will build an active army of around  as the armys chief of staff has said he needs desperately and really must have to protect our country  we now  we now have only  brigade combat teams or  troops and only onethird of combat teams are considered combat ready thats not good for our country i actually dont even like saying it because plenty of countries are watching us right now but well get it shaped up very quickly  we will build a marine corps based on  battalions which the heritage foundation notes is the minimum needed to deal with major contingencies right now we only have  we will build a navy of  surface ships and submarines as recommended by the bipartisan national defense panel we right now only have  ships and its not enough and we will build an air force of at least  fighter aircraft which the heritage foundation again has shown to be needed to execute current missions we now have  not enough we will also seek to develop a state of the art missile defense system  under obamaclinton our ballistic missile defense capability has been degraded at the very moment in the united states history and its allies we are facing the strongest and most heightened missile threat that we have ever ever had you look at iran you look at north korea you look at terrorists we dont even know where to look we dont know where to look but believe me you can look all over so we are going to do that we need a form of shield we want to protect our country  as these potential adversaries grow their missile programs us military facilities in asia and the middle east as well as our allies are increasingly in range with the united states homeland and we are really absolutely and potentially being threatened and within two years we will absolutely have a real threat theyll be able to reach us so easily the way its going right now we propose to rebuild the key tools of missile defense starting with navy cruisers that are the foundation of our missile defense capabilities in europe asia and the middle east the obamaclinton administration tried repeatedly to remove our cruisers from service then refused to modernize these very old aging aging ships theyre old theyre tired we will start by modernizing our cruisers to provide the ballistic missile defense capability our nation needs this will cost around  million per modernization as we seek to modernize a significant portion of these  ships it will also mean jobs for our country ok jobs for our country  and that is one of the big benefits its called jobs for our country which we desperately need as we expand our navy toward the goal of  ships we will also procure additional modern destroyers that are designed to handle the missile defense mission in the coming years accomplishing this missile rebuild and our military retooling will be a state effort every state in the union will be able to take part in rebuilding our military and developing technologies of tomorrow in other words the workers and the jobs will take place throughout the united states  in addition we will improve the department of defenses cyber capabilities a new threat a new problem very expensive and were not doing very well with cyber hillary clinton has taught us really how vulnerable we are in cyber hacking  thats probably the only thing that weve learned from hillary clinton  which is why one of the first things we must do is to enforce all classification rules and to enforce all laws relating to the handling of classified information hillary clinton put her emails on a secret server nobody knew about except for the man that was giving the fifth remember what ever happened to him where is he what happened to him where did he go he pled the fifth never heard  thats the end of him ayeyiyi  she put her emails on a secret server to cover up her payfor play scandal in the state department nothing threatens the integrity of our democracy more than when government officials put their public office up for sale we will also  we will also make it a priority to develop defensive and offensive cyber capabilities at our us cyber command and recruit the best and brightest americans  one of my first directives after taking office will be asking the joint chiefs of staff and all relevant federal departments to conduct a thorough review of united states cyber defenses and identify all vulnerabilities and we have to do that immediately including to our power grid our communications system and all vital infrastructure  i will then ask for a plan to immediately protect those vulnerabilities and then fix them at the same time  at the same time we will invest heavily in offensive cyber capabilities to disrupt our enemies including terrorists who rely heavily on internet communications  isis is using the internet to recruit isis is using the internet to intercept and do all sorts of things to our country we have to be many steps ahead of them and we will be  these new investments in cyber security and the modernization of our military will spur substantial new job creation in the private sector and help create the jobs and technologies of tomorrow thats what we have to do america must be the worlds dominant technological powerhouse of the st century and young americans including in our inner cities should get these new jobs through training through education it will happen  we must also ensure that we have the best medical care education and support for our military service members and their families both when they serve and when they return to civilian life  our veterans are not being treated well our veterans in many cases are being treated worse than illegal immigrants people that come into our county illegally our veterans are not being treated well and by the way hillary clinton has been doing this for  years now she says she can do it she doesnt have a clue doesnt have a clue  our debt to our men and women in uniform is eternal always will be to all of those who have served this nation i say so strongly that i will never ever let you down  we will protect those who protect us its very simple we will protect those who protect us  and we will follow their example of unity we will work across all racial and income lines to create one american nation together we will have one great american future our potential is unlimited  we will be one people under one god saluting one american flag  and by the way we love our flag  america will be a prosperous generous and inclusive society we will discard the failed policies and division of the past and embrace true american change to rebuild our economy rebuild our inner cities they need help so desperately and rebuild our country we will bring back our jobs and we will not let our jobs go to other countries  we will make america strong again we will make america safe again and we will make america great again greater than ever before  thank you very much and god bless you thank you thank you thank you very much thank you"

on that ad but i guarantee you the money would have been better spent doing something else because i dont think a lot of people have signed up but im hearing numbers like hundreds of millions of dollars ive never seen an ad thats been on so much and so long but its a  its an ad nevertheless about bringing your business to new york right and youve all seen it and i just wonder how much business has been got from that ad mike how much business has been gotten from that ad would you rather have the ad money or the business thats been got hed take the money come here get over here  this is like old home week come here say something   take care of yourself nice to see you rob good man hes going to do very well hes going to do very very well so over the years ive watched a lot of bad things happen a lot of good things happen but ive watched up state ive watched out on the island ive watched businesses leave and i think one of the reasons im standing here instead of somebody else is that frankly we have really hit a chord with jobs and weve also hit it with illegal immigration lots of different things the military in fact im going from here im going over to nbc were doing an interview with matt lauer im sure thatll be a lot of fun  it will be a lot of fun itll be a lot of fun im sure itll be very fair  and maybe it will be hey hes a good guy maybe it will be lets see well let you know right but i just  you know its so sad when i toured the state during the primaries and i got to see every part of the state i was in syracuse and i was in albany and i was everywhere and i saw those great beautiful buildings that were empty and rotting and falling down from the wind and the rain and the snow and theyre all over the state and theres no hope theres no hope other than if i become president because they will be great then  they will be great because were going to bring our jobs back to new york were going to bring our jobs back to our country but were going to bring our jobs back to new york what happened is so sad those companies have moved to mexico and other places but a lot are moving to mexico i tell this to  i have a friend who builds plants thats what he does he builds plants  building apartment house maybe he wouldnt know where but ill tell you  this is a great guy i think hes just about the biggest in the world at doing this and i say to him how are you doing hows business he said unbelievable oh good where are you building mostly mexico oh thats not so good thats not so good well why he said donald what were doing in mexico is the th wonder of the world the th wonder of the world think of that this is a man who builds these massive factories and car plants et cetera he said its unbelievable when you see whats happening i said how are you doing in the united states where hes from and where he really would like to be doing the building he goes meh not so good and he said but you have to come to mexico i just left mexico by the way that worked out very well  very well and i dont blame mexico for doing what theyre doing i mean i respect mexico i have great respect for the leaders and the president was very very nice but you know our businesses  were building  our business is just pouring  its just pouring into mexico and other places and then china in a different way they are making our product and theyre dumping it all over you look at whats happening with our steelworkers you look at whats happening with our miners and all of the  its just incredible whats happening to our country and weve got to stop it and we will stop it by the way  we will stop it were not going to let this continue to happen  so  so i just have to say its been such an honor to be involved for so long with the conservative party with the republican party too ed i couldnt forget you i would be in trouble if i forgot ed but for tonight the conservative party i have been a supporter  ive been a supporter of mikes for a long time and were going to do a great job you know its a little bit like fixing the country fixing the state we have to fix it when i last time  when i was with the republicans at the grand hyatt which i built i told the story of the wollman rink how it was closed for eight years a total disaster the city couldnt get it built they had no clue they had engineers that came from miami you dont want an engineer for an ice skating rink that comes from miami  and they couldnt make ice and theyd try and they had copper tubing and it was going miles and miles and miles and theyd lay it and the next day it would be stolen and then theyd lay it and it would be stolen this went on for years right theyd lay it down copper was and is very expensive and what happened is i went to koch ed koch the mayor of new york i said mr mayor my kids are growing up i want them to be able to ice skate at least once before theyre at a point where they dont want to ice skate anymore   and i see people sitting in the rink all day long they had two lunch breaks one in the morning one in the afternoon and there was no work and hundreds of people would be sitting in this massive slab and when they poured the slab theyd pour it in little chunks okay a lot of construction people because i have a lot of friends here but theyd pour it in little chunks and then theyd come in the next day and by the time it was all finished they had chunks all over the place and it wasnt even and it was like this it was a big level so when they put the water on on one side they had like a foot and a half of water and the other one they had like an inch and they didnt know what they were doing and i said to ed koch and it went to the newspapers i said you know because they didnt want to let me do it they didnt want to be stood up or they didnt want to be shown up and they went  i went to the newspapers the editorial board who actually even though im much more successful now they dont treat me nearly as well im trying to figure this out  but they actually did treat me very well and they said let trump do it and there was a lot of pressure put on and they let me do it and i did it in four months they had spent i think probably   million sometimes i hear  i hear  honestly they had no idea what they spent whatever it was they spent a fortune and i took it over and the first thing i did is i had to get an engineer so i fired the guy from miami because he obviously didnt know what he was doing and he recommended actually  he said why dont you try somebody mr trump from montreal i said thats good and then i remember i have a friend who was involved with the montreal canadians the ice hockey team so i called him i said edgar would you do me a favor do you have an engineer  do you have anybody that knows how to make ice he said oh i have the greatest guy and he gave me the name the guy came to new york really nice person and he said mr trump this is terrible theyre using gases theyre using freon and in that pipe if you have one little pinhole one little tiny pinhole in miles and miles of pipe itll escape and you cant make the ice its a horrible thing that stuff is meant for refrigerators not for ice skating rinks i said that makes sense you know in the back of the refrigerator right not quite you know  miles of stuff so he said what you want is brine i said whats brine he said well its basically water with salt in it so it doesnt freeze and you put it in rubber hoses and you make it very cold it doesnt freeze and all of a sudden you have ice i said boy that sounds good so i thanked him he drew it up i went out i hired some really good contractors i got rid of all the copper there was really none left it was mostly stolen and i put down the rubber hose nobody was stealing the rubber hose  like nobody stole the rubber hose its amazing rubber hose doesnt have quite the same allure but it was rubber hose clamps at each end miles and miles of rubber hose and we put it down quickly and beautifully we got the right machine that froze the water and the water went through the rubber hose and we checked it for leaks because even if it had leaked it wouldnt have mattered that much unlike the other but i said i dont want it to leak anyway so before the concrete went down we checked then i got a concrete guy who was great and we had trucks lined up to harlem all the way back to harlem one continuous pour because thats the only way to do it one continuous pour we laid the rebar and we had these trucks they poured for  hours straight its a big surface massive surface actually and it was like perfect we laser finished it and then we let it heal and we poured water over it two inches they said two inches is perfect and we turned on the machine and low and behold shortly thereafter there was ice  and amazing amazing  now its been a story thats been documented in the wharton school and the harvard business school and all over because its really  its private enterprise free enterprise private versus government and there are others you know i just did the ferry point job where this thing was under construction for like  years or something nobody even knows you know you ask them how long and they dont really even know they have no idea how much they spend and we got that one open its a tremendously big success in the bronx but somehow the wollman rink its just  its just a case study then we fix up the building which was real easy and i have it to this day theres no ice rink in the world that does more business than our ice rink and its been tremendously successful and we really you know have a good time and you know in a very very large scale version we have to do the same for new york state thats what we have to do we have to bring back our businesses we cant let our remaining businesses go if they go and they make a product and they want to move to mexico and they want to fire all of the employees like they have in all fairness been doing weve very late to the picture this speech should have been made  years ago but i was doing other things i was one of those companies that was doing well in new york but if they want to leave and if they want to make product in a different country and they want to send it over to our borders and yet fire all our people and not pay taxes and they think theyre going to send that over the border and theres not going to be consequences not going to happen and once you say look we hope you enjoy your stay in mexico or wherever its a beautiful location and youre building a lovely looking plant but every time you make your product and you think youre going to send it over what will be very soon a very strong border you will pay a  percent tax every single time you send your product over here  now ill tell you its very late in the game unfortunately but this should have been done years ago and you would have had nobody leave because two things are going to happen number one theyre not going to leave thats about  percent and then if they do thats okay too because were going to make a fortune okay but theyre not going to leave and nobody wants to do this because these people and these politicians are all controlled by the special interests that own the companies that want to move to other countries that make lots of money and thats the way it is so were going to bring our businesses back were going to make sure that theyre going to come back into new york and new york state im tired when i looked out at suffolk and different places on long island when i made that tour i couldnt believe what i saw i couldnt believe it actually ive been here all my life i couldnt believe it the devastation that has happened in this state i couldnt believe it so were going to turn things around were going to bring back our jobs were going to bring back companies and were going to start a lot of new companies but not with an ad were going to start it by having low taxes and being smart and i just want to tell you folks im being  percent serious you know everybody would say oh dont bother with new york because republicans dont win new york i dont think that were going to be in that position i think were going to win new york i think were going to do great in new york  dont forget hillary shes not a new yorker and by the way in arkansas and shes really not from arkansas either but in arkansas what do i have a  point lead i think i have a  point lead you know she is from arkansas but shes really from illinois  im a real new yorker folks i will say this you will never get more of a new yorker if you want a president than youre getting with me  so i want to thank mike i want to thank the conservative party i want to thank everybody in this room i want to thank my son eric trump who has been working and his wife lara  and we have so many supporters but i just want to say to you we are going to play so hard we are going to play so hard and win we are going to win this state its going to shock people and by the way you know if we win this state its over we win ok we win  so i appreciate the endorsement of mike always i really   appreciate being given this great honor by the conservative party and i will tell you mike get up here for one second come here come here come here  i want to thank you a man  were a hell of a job for this man thank you thank you everybody thank you  thank you very much everybody thank you thank you carl"
67,"Trump","and they are terrific they have a great future they will be taking my job someday  and i will be happy about it in particular though i want to thank mr ron packard where is ron is he here someplace yes he is thank you ron fantastic job and ms deborah mays who has really done an incredible job deborah thank you thank you what a great job for hosting us at this beautiful school today we are going to discuss one of the most important issues in this campaign school choice but before we do i want to briefly discuss new revelations about hillary clintons very famous emails according to the fbi report the fbi did not find that hostile foreign actors  and think of this its so important  when they went around  they went around and were so vigilant at least as far as this but they found that hostile foreign actors gained access to the personal email accounts of individuals with whom clinton was in regular contact and in doing so obtained emails sent to or received by clinton on her personal account and every time she talks about the subject its different shes got to get her act together remember hillary clinton was e mailing about the drone program among many other extremely sensitive matters this is yet more evidence that clinton is unfit to be your commander in chief by the way the whole country saw how unfit she was at the town hall last night where she refused to take accountability for failed policies in the middle east that have produced millions of refugees unleashed horror of radical islamic terrorism all over and made us less safe than ever before throughout it all she put the country  and i mean the entire country  at risk in order to cover up her pay for play scandals as secretary of state these include scandals giving up uranium to russia doing favors for ubs bank and selling contracts to friends and family in haiti its all about hiding criminal enterprise and thats what its about as part of her criminal cover up hillarys  and you know her staff you know it well youd read it about it all the time you just read about it and its getting worse and worse hillary clintons staff deleted and digitally bleached  which is acid cleaned  her emails after receiving a congressional subpoena thats after receiving not before thats after receiving she gets a subpoena from the united states congress and she deletes and bleaches she also and her staff destroyed some of her  different phones but this time with a hammer ive never done that  then when she was interviewed by the fbi she claims she couldnt remember important events  times she couldnt even remember whether she was trained or handling classified information didnt remember anything about it so if she really didnt remember thats a problem and if she did remember thats a problem she even said she didnt know what the letter c stood for whether it was confidential classified information or something all the while as hillary and bill raked in millions of dollars from special interests the world was falling apart hillary clintons policies produced ruin in libya iraq and syria absolute ruin and death she failed in russia she failed in china she failed miserably in north korea her policies unleashed isis spread terrorism and put iran on a path to nuclear weapons  not to mention the ransom payments  those ransom payments remember two weeks ago it was  million in cash well yesterday we found out that in cash it was  billion these are unheard of  this is cash this isnt wire transfer this isnt check this is cash  billion then you say is that going to terror or is that going to peoples bank accounts i actually think its going to both on top of it all hillary clinton is trigger happy totally trigger happy she has raced to invade intervene and topple regimes she believes in globalism not americanism everybody understands it last night she even falsely said no american died in libya now i heard that and i said could she have forgotten so quickly then she also falsely said there is no ground troops in iraq even though we have  military personnel there right now iraq is one of the biggest differences in this race i opposed going in and i did oppose it despite the media saying no yes no i opposed going in and i opposed the reckless way hillary clinton took us out along with president obama letting isis fill that big terrible void but i was opposed to the war from the beginning long after my interview with howard stern but three months before the iraq war started i said in an interview with neil cavuto that perhaps we shouldnt be doing it yet and that the economy  these are quotes  that the economy  this was on live television  the economy is a much bigger problem as far as the president is concerned this was before the war started by a very short distance then on march th of  just after the war had started just days after just a little while after i was quoted as saying the war is a mess and yet more evidence that i had opposed the war from the start i said the war is a mess so im  television somewhere july of  i said i would love to see new york city and some of our cities and some of the states of our nation get some of the money thats going toward iraq and other places because you know they really need it and they need it badly i said that we have numerous other quotes too both before and shortly after then in august of  very early in the conflict extremely early in the conflict right at the beginning i made a detailed statement in an interview to esquire magazine so right at the beginning and by the way numerous honest reporters said well trump may have said at the beginning and some said he did say at the beginning because they had cavutos clip and other clips but some said you know it doesnt matter because right at the beginning he made very strong statements many years ago heres what esquire magazine said this is a quote absolute quote look at the war in iraq and the mess that we are in so right after the war started i would never have handled it that way does anybody really believe that iraq is going to be a wonderful democracy where people are going to run down to the voting box and gently put in their ballot and the winner is happily going to step up and to lead the country so it is simply  i go come on two minutes after we leave there is going to be a revolution pretty good and the meanest toughest smartest most vicious guy will take over well thats going to be combinations of isis and iran irans taking  theyre taking over among the richest and largest oil reserves in the world we let them do it we let them do it should have never been in the war but we should have never ever have got out of the way the way barack obama got us out along with hillary clinton because we opened it up for isis so continued what was the purpose this is me right at the beginning of the war in an article what was the purpose of this whole thing what was the purpose hundreds and hundreds of young people are being killed and what about the people coming back with no arms and with no legs not to mention the other side all those iraqi kids who have been blown to pieces and it turns out that all the reasons for the war are just blatantly wrong all this for nothing all this for nothing this was right at the beginning of the war then they see you know i see the lies last night  donald trump was always in favor of the war in iraq thats why i had to do this because the media is so dishonest so terribly dishonest and you understand it you understand and you understand the media is so terribly dishonest so i had to do this i ended with i would have been tougher on terrorism bin laden would have been caught a long time ago before he was ultimately caught prior to the downing of the world trade center so this was right at the beginning and those other statements were before the war even started and the howard statement was long before it was the first time anybody ever asked me about iraq and i said i dont know i was very  but that was superseded because before the war much closer to the war i gave statements that we shouldnt go in and shortly thereafter immediately thereafter  and honestly a lot of reporters said hey right at the beginning he made this statement  and that statement was a very major story in esquire magazine so i just wanted to set the record straight there is so much lying going on and hillary clinton lied last night about worse things including her email but she also lied about this had i been in congress at the time of the invasion i would have cast a vote in opposition for years i have been a critic of this kind of reckless foreign invasions and look lets face it interventions  thats what they are  that have been a hallmark of trigger happy hillary and her failed career shes been a disaster heres the bottom line i was a private citizen i had no access to briefings or great intelligence surveys but she did i had no access to anything i was a private citizen frankly nobody really cared too much about what i said i was doing business i dont even know why i was asked the question i guess because i was asked the question  someone else but i didnt have access to all of the intelligence information that she did and everybody else did but in iraq my judgment was right and hers  with all of this information and all of this great intelligence information  was wrong along with a lot of other people in all fairness it was a big mistake totally destabilized the middle east it was a big mistake death death to so many people hillary clinton is always complaining about whats wrong i just watched her on the tarmac she tried to make up for her horrible performance last night it was a horrible performance so she went on the tarmac and told more lies but shes been there  remember this  shes always talking about things that shes going to do but shes been there for more than  years and shes never done anything about it never done anything and all you have to do is look at new york state where she ran for senator she said she will bring jobs back to new york state its a disaster no jobs have come back jobs have left new york state upstate new york and the areas that she was talking about they are disasters all you have to do is look at new york state she said she was going to bring tremendous jobs back it would be wonderful  just like shes saying now she wouldnt know how to bring a job back she wouldnt have a clue so its all talk but nothing happens and thats whats going to happen with our country on jobs and nobody is going to bring jobs back like donald trump i will be the greatest jobs producing president that god ever created and i say that with my pastor is in the front row my pastor believe me  so were on track now to spend  listen to this   trillion   trillion could have rebuilt our country twice all together on wars in iraq and afghanistan and the middle east meanwhile massive portions of our country are in a state of total disrepair its time to rebuild america  and when i say that we will also before we get totally started we will take out isis remember that we have no choice we have no choice too many americans living in our inner cities have not been included in the american dream we are a nation and were one nation when any part of our country hurts our whole country hurts my goal as president will be to ensure that every child in this nation african american hispanic american all americans will be placed on the ladder to success and i define that as great education and a great job the ladder rests on a fundamental foundation we need safety theres such danger in our inner cities theres such danger in our communities in order to help our children succeed our first duty is to ensure that every kid in america can grow up in a safe community you read whats happening you see whats happening you cant have prosperity without security this is the new civil rights agenda of our time the right to a safe community a quality education and a wonderful job  including for those great students that i met just a little while ago theyre going to do great they are really going great youve done such a great job with the education here our campaign represents the long awaited chance to break with the bitter failures of the past and to embrace a new and strong american future theres no failed policy more in need of urgent change than our government run education monopoly and you know in the back thats exactly what it is theyre protecting a lot of people that have a lot of really high paying jobs and theyre not doing the jobs like deborah that i can tell you  and deborah theyre making a lot more money than you but well have to talk about that later  the democratic party has trapped millions of african american and hispanic youth in failing government schools that deny them the opportunity to join the ladder of american success its time to break up that monopoly have to do it  i want every single inner city child in america who is today trapped in a failing school to have the freedom the civil right to attend the school of their choice their parents will choose the finest school they will attend that school this includes private schools traditional public schools magnet schools and charter schools which must be included in any definition of school choice our government spends more than enough money to easily pay for this initiative with billions and billions of dollars to be left over its simply a matter of putting students first not the education bureaucracy and thats whats happened  lets run through the numbers at the state and federal level the united states spends more than  billion on k education each year thats an average of about  for every student enrolled in our elementary and secondary public    of costs the other roughly  billion spent on k  education comes from the states we spend more per student than almost any other major country in the world and were doing very poorly in terms of alist we spend more by far and were doing very poorly so obviously common core does not work  our largest cities spend some of the largest amounts of money on public schools its their biggest cost new york city spends  per pupil baltimore spends  per student chicago spends  per student and los angeles its  just imagine if each student in these school systems was given a scholarship for this amount of money allowing them and their family to choose the public or private school of their choice wouldnt that be great  not only would this empower families but it would create a massive education market that is competitive and produces better outcomes and i mean far better outcomes these schools would then cater to the needs of the individual student and family not the needs of the teachers union  which is a tremendous force and a tremendous barrier to getting done what you want to get done and they will be a beneficiary because they will be also working in these great schools thats whats going to happen they will come in    school choice it will be done by reprioritizing existing federal dollars we have to reprioritize specifically my plan would use  billion of existing federal dollars to establish a block grant for the  million school age kids living in absolute poverty we will give states the option to allow these funds to follow the student through the public or private school they attend the parents will be so happy number one well have safe streets and number two they will walk their child to a school that they want to be in how about that how is that  what a difference what a difference compare that to today where people say how do you do it how do you do it distribution of this grant will favor states that have private school choice and charter roles  encouraging them to participate theyre going to be encouraged to participate this  billion will instantly extend choice to millions and millions more students a state like ohio will benefit greatly from these new funds ohio is a leader in school choice ohio has five private school choice programs that serve over  students and  charter schools serving  students great job but the  billion is only a beginning as president i will establish the national model of providing school choice to every american child living in poverty that means that we want every disadvantaged child to be able to choose local public private or charter school a magnet school any of these schools that is best for them and for their family for mom and dad each state will develop its own formula but we want the dollars to follow the student so important the dollars will follow the student and the student will follow the right school theyre going to follow the right school nine in ten dollars spent on k education is spent at the state and local level to achieve this longterm goal we will have to make this a shared national mission to bring hope to every child in every city in this land in our country in our great country i will use the pulpit of the presidency to campaign for this in all  states and i will call upon the american people to elect officials at the city state and federal levels who support school choice so important my administration will partner with the leadership of inner city  and i mean any one of them any one of them any inner city in america  chicago baltimore detroit cleveland i love cleveland we love cleveland  got a great experience in cleveland thats all i know and by the way your police department did a phenomenal job  and thats any city that is willing to run a pilot program to provide school choice to every child in that community in baltimore for instance that would mean more than  in funds available per student cant beat that im confident that the politicians will not be able to suppress the will of the people anymore its too much too strong eventually they break the politicians they always break they certainly break on trade for our country without making a good deal right they break on an hourly basis if we can put a man on the moon dig out the panama canal and win two world    can provide school choice to every disadvantaged child in american if the states collectively contribute another  billion of their own education budgets toward school choice on top of the  billion in federal dollars that could provide  in school choice funds to every single k student who today is living in poverty the money will follow the student that means the student will be able to attend that public private charter magnet school of their choice and each state will develop its own system that works best for them they can develop systems the likes of which youve never seen and some states will do better than others and then they get those people to come to your state then other things will be happening it will be so exciting its not really a question of the money because well be saving money and having a far better education as your president i will be the nations biggest cheerleader for school choice i understand many stale old politicians will resist there will be a lot of pressure theyll get a lot of pressure on that but its time for our country to start thinking big and correct once again we spend too much time quibbling over the smallest things when we should spend our time dreaming about the great adventures that lie ahead i will also support merit pay for teachers the great teachers  so that we reward our best teachers instead of the failed tenure system that rewards bad teachers and punishes the good ones and the bad ones are making the same money and sometimes more than the good ones at the same time we have to ensure that jobs are waiting for our young kids when they graduate high school and college my policy will add millions of new jobs for the future especially for african american and hispanic communities produce such great jobs my plan to lift restrictions on the production of american energy will not only make home energy bills a lot cheaper  your electric bills will be a lot less  but it will add an estimated half a million jobs per year by reducing radical regulations and over taxation  were bringing your taxes way down  we can bring thousands of new companies into our poorest communities crucially my trade reforms will create a manufacturing revival in america as you know all of your companies  cleveland is a great example  but your companies are being ripped out of your community and your people are being left jobless and your governments being left with taxes we have nearly  billion  think of it  billion annual trade deficit with the world we trade with the world we have a trade deficit of  billion who is negotiating these deals whos doing it   thats actually very good hillary clinton is absolutely a good answer hillary clinton and people like hillary clinton that havent got a clue and the clue they do have goes to their donors and the special interests believe me thats money coming straight out of the states like ohio and pennsylvania and michigan and maine and so many others ive seem so many its so sad when i campaigned during the primaries i saw everything and it was so sad to see communities that have just been left jobless where the companies have moved to other countries mexico in particular but other countries by ending foreign currency manipulation product dumping and other predatory trading practices we will be able to open thousands of new plants and factories across america in driving over today i saw so many places factories   years ago that were thriving and theyre just dead worthless a real estate person you wouldnt pay anything worthless well put them back into action again the future is filled with limitless possibilities for our nation and exciting opportunities for our wonderful children we all have to do and we just have to work  we all have to work but we all have to cut our ties with the failed politics of the past you have to cut your ties have to cut your ties these are the people that put us in this situation theyre not going to take us out theyre not going to take us out that includes  and hillary clinton created a lot of the problems and now shes saying how shes going to take us out she doesnt have a clue not even a little clue weve had such a failed foreign policy with the people we have now a failed education policy a totally failed economic policy and underneath it all a failed political system that rewards politicians for how many donors they have or how many journalists they know not how many americans they help to live better and more prosperous lives thats how they get rewarded theyll talk to you and talk to you theyll come into cleveland shell be saying what a wonderful job shes going to do shell get your vote then shell say see you in four years she might even say see you in four years suckers because thats what it is  see you in four years suckers but the failures of the past are about to end that ending begins on a very special day for this country november th get out and vote we will have one american nation we will be one american people who are fighting to give every child in every forgotten stretch of this country the chance to live out their dreams in safety and in peace that means a safe neighborhood a quality education and a secure highpaying and exciting job we only have bad jobs there arent good jobs any more many of our good jobs have left theyre gone this is how we will rebuild our future this is how we will make america great again for everyone"

primaries was absolutely incredible i have to tell you  all across the nation a lot of people said i wonder if donald will get the evangelicals i got the evangelicals  im gonna make it up to you too

gotten to know so many people i     during my trip to louisiana where christian volunteers raced to help their fellow citizens in need franklin graham is an example he brought the most incredible people and equipment to louisiana  and he didnt want anything for it hes a great man its that spirit of giving that we will need to rebuild louisiana and to rebuild this country which is in serious serious trouble  yet our media culture often mocks and demeans people of faith and you understand that all the time i hear from concerned parents how much harder it is for a christian family to raise their children in todays media environment it is right isnt it it is right not even close  your values of love charity and faith built this nation  so how can it be that our media treats people of faith so poorly one of the reasons is that our politicians have really abandoned you to a large extent and hillary clinton you can forget about her  so let me state this right upfront a trump administration our christian heritage will be cherished protected defended like youve never seen before  believe me i believe and you believe it and you know it you know it and that includes religious liberty remember remember i recently had a chance to visit a church in detroit great faith ministries international stand up if youre a member thats good that was a great  that was an amazing experience  and the bishop what a great guy in my remarks i spoke     about how african american church and this is all across the country for centuries have been the conscience of our nation their unbreakable faith and spirit overcame some of the most difficult periods in our history leading us all to a better future its very true amazing this was such an amazing experience this is the power of faith its the power to heal its the power to unite its the power to make all of us live better lives all of us  our nation today is divided nobody likes to say it but were living in a very very divided nation it will be our faith in god in his teachings in each other that will lead us back to unity  each of us here today has a role to play in bringing our country together united in common purpose and in common values so lets talk today about some of the things and these are great things that we can do together to create the american future for everybody not just a certain group of people but for everybody the first thing we have to do is give our churches their voice back its been taken away  the johnson amendment has blocked our pastors and ministers and others from speaking their minds from their own pulpits if they want to talk about christianity if they want to preach if they want to talk about politics theyre unable to do so  if they want to do it they take a tremendous risk that they lose their taxexempt status all religious leaders should be able to freely express their thoughts and feelings on religious matters and i will repeal the johnson amendment if i am elected your president i promise  so important thank you thats so important and i must tell you from the heart this started  a building of mine in manhattan i had  pastors in a big conference room and we actually had  pastors two rabbis a couple of priests we were all talking and we were there for two hours and at the end it was a love fest we all agreed it was like a love fest and i said to them  we were high up in a building on fifth avenue and i said to them id love your support and i know when i can get support im quite sophisticated and i know they wanted to give me their total support  percent just like i had in the primaries and i said i really would like your support and they didnt really know what i was talking about and i said whats going on here they said well sir we cant do that because we would be violating the laws and i said whats the punishment well we could lose our taxexempt status which of course is a massive penalty i said tell me about this and we sat down and they talked about it when did it happen  or so lyndon johnson was having problems powerful guy i actually as his own  way have to gain respect for what he was able to do can you imagine that this man singlehandedly  he was having problems with churches and there was a church in houston that was giving him a hard time maybe for a very good reason and he put in an amendment that basically stopped our great pastors and ministers and others from talking under the penalty of losing their taxexempt status so we were looking down onto the sidewalk and there were people walking on the sidewalk and i said so folks what youre telling me is those people walking way way down there on the sidewalk have really more power than you do because theyre allowed to express their feelings and thoughts openly and without penalty and one of the pastors who i knew very well  and these are powerful people these are strong people with magnificent voices and just  and magnificent hearts much more importantly they looked at me and they said thats actually right they have more power than we do were not allowed to express and thats when i said we have to start thinking about this and i thought about it and then we had a large group of pastors again i said i have thought about it if i become president we are going to knock out the johnson amendment we are going to do that and its not going to be hard  its not going to be hard when you  when you think from the standpoint of political you have more than men  lets say men are  percent women are  percent youre much more than  percent added together and i actually believe thats one of the reasons why you havent seen christianity and other religions within the united states going like a rocket ship like our polls have been going in the last four weeks a rocket ship right   i really believe that because youre great people the people that you rely on sunday and all during the week theyve been stopped from talking and speaking by a law and were going to get rid of that law  its going to get rid of  were going to get rid of it so fast and im so proud to say honestly i dont want to take credit     but you had  people in that first meeting and many more in the second i am so proud i was just telling this to tony  to say that was my idea i figure its the only way im getting to heaven so this is going to very  the only way so were going to get rid of it and were going to let your great people speak and youre going to see something happen thats going to be very very good ok so important i hope  which means you have to get out and vote on november  you cannot  you didnt vote four years ago you didnt vote you didnt well you did a few of you did  believe me i know i look at the stats you didnt vote but this time you really have  and this is your last chance this is it i mean well never have this opportunity again so i hope you can get every one of your friends and just get up your family and your friends and get out and vote ok november   thank you and if you do were going to win by a lot thats not going to even be a close election if you dont could be a very unhappy november  were also going to repeal and replace disastrous obamacare  which gives the government control over the lives of every day citizens and the numbers are horrendous your premiums are going up by    percent the deductible is so high you never get to use it unless you are going to  a very long and very complex bad period very very long it is a disaster its a disaster and everybody knows that that its going to die of its own weight anyway but were going to get rid of it and were going to replace it with some great great alternatives a much better healthcare at a much lower price  hillary clinton wants to have completely government run healthcare which would be a disaster for the liberties and freedoms of all america this is what she wants thats what shes aiming at thats what obama wanted he didnt quite there but he got this and you see how bad this has been one of the biggest issues in this race is going to be the issue of school choice  and i cant possibly emphasize this enough millions of poor and disadvantaged students are trapped in failing schools this education crisis afflicts all communities but none more so than the african american community none the democratic party has run the inner cities of america for    years some cases over  years over  years their policies and their politics and in particular the politics of people like hillary clinton have produced only poverty joblessness and rising crime  when she was running for the senate in new york state she said she was gonna produce jobs jobs jobs in upstate new york its a disaster she could have produced jobs big thing jobs were gonna bring back jobs gonna  catastrophe weve lost tens of thousands of jobs  she never did a thing it was all talk no action just like what shes doing right now is all talk and no action shell talk and talk and nothing will happen only bad will happen but you just have to ask the people in upstate new york  she won because of them and she produced absolutely nothing jobs left its today one of the worst one of the most depressing places in this country so just remember that when you hear her talking about jobs i know jobs she doesnt know jobs that i can tell you  i have outlined a new civil rights agenda for our time the right to a safe community a great education and a secure job and i say to africanamerican parents i say to hispanicamerican parents and i say it with great respect our inner cities are a disaster crime no jobs education is the worst in many cases almost worldwide bad and in many cases actually worldwide bad i say with great respect what do you have to lose it cant get any worse it cant get any worse you choose donald trump im gonna fix the problem youre gonna have safety youre gonna have good education were gonna get jobs because were gonna bring our jobs back mexicos taken our jobs so many other places have taken our jobs what chinas doing to us is horrible well have jobs what have you got to lose im gonna fix it im gonna fix it  school choice is at the center of this civil rights agenda and my goal is to provide every single inner city child in american that is trapped in a failing government school the freedom to attend the school of their choice competition and the schools will get better and better and better  and if that means a private school a religious school or a charter school or a magnet school  school choice also means that parents can home school their children  hundred percent  hillary clinton opposes school choice because shes controlled totally totally like a puppet by special interests her policies will force millions of africanamerican and hispanic children to remain stuck in failed government schools leading to higher unemployment and more poverty the poverty levels in this country nobody will believe nobody will believe my plan will break the government monopoly and make schools compete to provide the best services for our children including every africanamerican and hispanic child in this country every single one of them   this proposal begins with a  billion block grant from the federal government to states to pursue school choice programs however  thats good right  however because  percent of education spending is at the state level i will campaign to get the states to reallocate another  billion of their education budgets to school choice programs if we do this that would mean  in school choice funds for every disadvantaged student in america what a difference this is going to make the money will follow the student to the public private or religious school that is best for them and their family in so many ways youre going to have a choice my administration will partner with the leadership of any inner city anybody anybody in the inner cities of america willing to run a pilot program  and there will be a lot of them  to provide school choice to every child in that community in baltimore for instance that would mean more than  in funds available per student as your president i will be the biggest cheerleader for school choice youve ever seen  this means a lot of me because i know it can turn things around again the education cant get worse common core were going to end it well bring in education  i will fight for every child in this country who deserve better futures the africanamerican community has heard my message that i am going to make the inner city safe again and im going to bring back jobs and im going to bring back the great education dont be surprised  remember this november eighth dont be surprised because we have been given a lot of support over the last three or four weeks if on november eighth i get more africanamerican and hispanic votes than anyone thought possible about a month ago you see whats going on theyre starting  people are starting to hear about this and they say wow wow theyre liking it and again cant get any worse its going to get a lot better but only if i do they cant do it the  the democrats they have what theyve done is incredible and hillary clinton will be absolutely more of the same rigid itll never change remember  years  years  its not going to change not going to happen now lets talk about another issue that will define the future of this country for generations to come the united states supreme court  earlier this year we lost the great justice antonin scalia the next president will not only have to fill this seat but as many as four others it could even be  i mean we could end up with a total of five judges by one president it would be recordsetting probably be three could be four could even be five and you pick the wrong people you have a country that is no longer your country it will be a disaster one of the most important issues frankly other than maybe defense  because were going to build up our military its so depleted were going to take care of our vets were going to protect your second amendment so many things  but one of the most important  some people think its actually the most important  is the filling of the seats united states supreme court you see whats happening right now essentially its four and four and you see what  how bad it is were going to pick great judges ive already put a list of  federalist society highly recommended got uniform great on these  people and we are going to put truly great people  maybe we use judge scalia as the ultimate example of what we are looking for ok  this will determine whether or not we remain a constitutional republic frankly thats whats going to happen i have pledged to appoint judges who uphold the constitution to protect your religious liberty and apply the law as written  we reject judges who rewrite the constitution to impose their own personal views on  millionplus americans not going to have that ive made public a list of judges as i said that will guide my selection process hillary clinton has refused to provide such a list and we brought it up  lets see a list if you ever saw the list you would walk out of here not feeling very well  because she knows the extremist judges she would pick would be rejected by the overwhelming majority of the american public theyd be rejected clintons judicial picks would allow her to completely take over american healthcare the american economy and americans religious liberty not to mention your second amendment which is on very thin ice right now as you know because of the fact that were fourfour if they even pick one judge whos wrong you can probably as you know it you can kiss the second amendment goodbye and we dont want to see that another issue in this race of great importance to everyone in this room is the issue of course of national security just today it was announced that north korea performed its fifth nuclear test its forth since hillary clinton became secretary of state its just one more massive failure from a failed secretary of state  she failed at everything her policies have also put iran onto a path of nuclear weapons and i have to say made them overnight an absolute power they were dying three years ago the sanctions were choking them they would have fallen but obama didnt support people that would have taken over and i think in this case probably would have taken over the right way they had no support but look at whats happened to iran in such a short period of time but remember the ransom payments remember it was  million two weeks ago but then they made a mistake this is cash remember they said they paid cash because they couldnt open a bank account there was no way of sending it into a checking account  all lies just like obamacare was a big lie remember you can use your plan you can use your doctors  times right twenty seven times use your doctors use your plan it turned out to be a lie its all a lie its all a big lie its a rigged system and its a lie  and ill tell you what  ill tell you what the  million for those that havent been reading the papers over the last two days turned out to be  billion in cash cash and i actually said  they said that moneys going to be used for terror i said no they dont need it for terror theyve got  billion thats in addition to the  billion we gave them back i said they dont need it this is going into their swiss accounts and going into their accounts theyre not going to use it for terror they have plenty of money for terror think of it  billion cash massive big vats of cash you saw them cartons never saw anything like it ive seen a lot of cash  never saw anything like this   billion can you imagine these guys planes get  they stop remember they wouldnt give back the hostages they waited there for hours and hours and obama kept saying no no this has nothing to do even the hostages said they kept us waiting for a certain plane to come in not to take them back because they were waiting for something it was this just another lie but can you imagine these people sitting there and they see  billion in cash oy oy oy they think were stupid they think were stupid they wont be thinking it for long  at the same time isis is hunting down and exterminating what it calls the nation of the cross isis is carrying out a genocide against christians in the middle east we cannot let this evil continue cant let it isis must be destroyed have to have no choice  to defeat isis we must use military warfare but also cyber warfare financial warfare and ideological warfare its a whole different ballgame today than it was  years ago and  years ago different world we must also establish a bipartisan goal in the united states and an international goal with our allies of defeating radical islamic terrorism  words that our president wont use and words that hillary clinton wont use just like we won the cold war by identifying our enemy and building a consensus to guide a longterm strategy so too must we do the same with islamic terrorism by the way president obama has allowed syrian refugees to pour into our country at unbelievable rates and hillary clinton wants to allow  percent more but its almost impossible to get a christian in from syria they take others but they dont take christians very rare very rare  so i said that we need to make safe zones in the region we want to take care of people but we absolutely cannot allow this potential tremendous threat to continue and we have to stop this this is going to be potentially a catastrophe for our country its from within this could be the alltime great trojan horse this could be it you ever notice on the  you look at the migration trail and you see people with cell phones cell phones and some of the cell phones have the isis flag printed on them and some of them have things far worse than that scenes far worse than that so it was the failed policies you have to remember of hillary clinton and obama that unleashed isis in the first place if they did the right thing you wouldnt be talking about isis right now now she wants to get rid of them oh were going to get rid of them she tells them already there will be no boots on the ground now even if you even dont want boots on the ground you dont want to say it dont say it now theyre saying oh i hope she wins oh boy would they dream of having her as president can you imagine they dream about it every night having hillary clinton but even if you believe it  and i can understand that no boots on the ground i can understand you dont say it let them think theyre going to go through hell dont say it  can you imagine the great general douglas macarthur can you imagine the great general george patton or one of our great generals that we have today general flynn whos here someplace i love general flynn  but can you imagine these people saying i mean theyre basically giving out the strategy there will be no boots on the ground if you dont want that i fully understand dont say it dont say it can you imagine macarthur saying were going to fight the enemy and were going to move our troops in about a month were going to hit from behind  were going to hit them from the front but  and everything they say turns out to be true you know i hate to say this because we have a lot of evangelicals in this room but maybe we shouldnt be so honest when it comes to military strategy does that make sense  hope i didnt lose your vote for saying that  just look at what her policies have left us with in iraq syria and libya the problem is hillary clinton is trigger happy she really is shes trigger happy and yet she says no boots which is sort of  probably will be boots you know probably will turn out to be another disaster her tenure has brought us only war and destruction and death shes just too quick to intervene invade or to push for regime change with people we dont even know who they are and they take over and theyre far worse this creates the power vacuums that are filled by terrorists and groups like isis my administration on the other hand will work with any country that is willing to partner with us to defeat isis and halt radical islamic terrorism and by the way that includes russia if they want to join us on knocking out isis that is just fine as far as im concerned  its a very imperfect world and you cant always choose your friends life but you can never fail to recognize your enemies and we have some real enemies unfortunately for our country our enemies probably hacked into hillary clintons emails these are the same emails she destroyed after receiving a federal subpoena whats that  using software in order to bleach the email so you can never ever see then she even mysteriously lost  different phones before the fbi got them and many were destroyed with a hammer   did anybody ever hit a hammer  you know maybe two or three people but they were just released from prison those two people  can you believe this destroyed them with a hammer the old fashioned way i guess  the other night in the commanderinchief forum  did anybody see that how did i do  good well we have a big debate coming up who knows whats going to happen there but i will say every poll has me winning big league the commanderinchief we had  the polls came out after that event and we won big league now we have a debate coming up i dont imagine any of you are going to be watching the debate  i wont i promise hillary clinton answered questions on her e mails horribly thats why she lost thats why she did so poorly she was terrible she was  honestly i shouldnt be saying this she was terrible  she keeps talking about the emails every time she talks about them she talks about them differently it seems each week  true  she has like a different answer but there can be no answer when she deletes  emails bleaches them so they can never be recovered an unheard of practice hammers them into total silence you know whats happening you know whats happening i always say getting away with that will be the single greatest accomplishment of her career its true its true  so her answers were bad they were bad and a lot of people said it was so totally dishonest and you know she was blaming matt lauer i thought matt lauer did a very good job i mean his questions to me were very tough but the gentleman who stood up and said honestly you should be in prison for what you did to me that was the tough one that was the tough  that was a tough question well sort of a question in the form of a statement right  clinton is unfit to be our president for many reasons  true   shes unfit for many reasons the biggest of which is her judgment its just so bad its time to restore honesty and integrity to our government we have to do it   and one more issue  final issue i wanted to discuss today is the economy and helping those in need there is no more charitable group in this country than christians and all of us  true  and all of us here today determined to lift suffering americans out of poverty were going to do it with  a lot of other people are going to help as your president i will pursue a complete reform of our economy to bring back millions of new jobs into our country millions of new jobs weve lost our jobs like were a bunch of babies theyve gone to other countries theyve gone to mexico theyve gone to many other countries chinas taking massive advantage of us its all so easy believe me its all so easy that includes we will be doing massive tax cuts for working families and for businesses  it includes very importantly the elimination of all needless jobkilling regulations  it includes lifting the restrictions on america energy which is under siege i will also renegotiate nafta and if they dont want to renegotiate it so it becomes a twoway highway not just a oneway highway out of the united states for our companies and our jobs we will terminate nafta believe me  well stand up to china and were going to fight for every last job its going to be america first and its going to be the american worker first  crucially i will also fight for the american family and american family values the family must be at the center of any antipoverty agenda has to be  thank you our country just lost one of the great champions for the american family phyllis schlafly great woman really great woman  we send our thoughts and prayers to her loved ones i will be going to her funeral tomorrow in st louis  phyllis fought very hard to the very end for a free and prosperous america she understood that to be truly united as a country we cant simply turn to government or to politicians the bedrock of our unity is the realization that were all brothers and sisters created by the same god phyllis understood that phyllis understood  and by the way phyllis endorsed me a long time ago when it wasnt necessarily something that was so easy to do and she was incredible she was so brave she endorsed me and that was not the thing to do at the time people said trump she said hes going to win you dont understand he knows how to win hes going to win they said phyllis not going to be trump and we went boom boom boom  but i will tell you phyllis endorsed me at a time when it wasnt necessarily the thing to do even the popular thing to do and i will never forget that that had a huge impact she was a great great powerful woman with a tremendous heart and i look forward to being with her family tomorrow because you really  thats a celebration she was  years old  were all equal and we all come from the same creator if we remember that simple fact then our future is truly limitless there is nothing we as americans cant do theres a biblical verse that ive often read and i want to repeat it again because i think it is so important to what were trying to achieve right now for our country its from first john chapter four no one has ever seen god but if we love one another god lives in us and his love is made complete in us so true  so true imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as one people under one god saluting one flag  its time to stop quibbling over the smallest words and time to start dreaming about the great adventures that lie ahead for our country this is my promise to all of you starting in  we will be one american nation its time to break our ties with the bitter failures of the past and to embrace a new american future have to do it together we will make america believe again we will make america united again and we will make america great again thank you much and god bless you thank you thank you thank you very much"
69,"Trump","the fact that so many encrusted old political insiders oppose this incredible campaign this incredible movement is the best proof you will ever need that we are fighting for real change not partisan change not change for the donors were fighting for all americans democrats republicans independents conservatives liberals even liberals who failed us in this corrupt corrupt corrupt system were fighting for everyone who doesnt have a voice and i will tell you the campaign contributions coming in are unbelievable small donors  a pop  and im spending my money i am spending a fortune i am spending a lot im putting up my money and were being helped by small donors and were setting records and we have done some job but i will say if we dont make it  despite what they say if we dont make it theyre all saying it doesnt matter what youve done has never been done before its one of the great phenomena let me tell you if we dont make it its the greatest waste of time energy and money that i can ever think of i will tell you we dont make it  but were going to make it and polls came out today  polls came out today where were up in ohio were up in florida were up in north carolina up  were up nationwide cnn two days ago up nationwide so i just want to tell you folks were going to get it there weve been abused long enough as a country weve been abused long enough were also fighting for every region of this country for every part of florida and every single pat of america from pensacola  great place  to pittsburgh from baltimore to baton rouge were fighting for ever last city and every last person in the country everybody  hillary clinton and you can see that from those emails   is a very dishonest candidate of the past  ours is the campaign of the future in this future were going to pursue new trade policies that put american workers first and were going to keep our jobs in our country  were not going to let them take our jobs anymore folks were not going to let it happen its been happening long enough and the reason they dont do anything about it is because the special interests and the donors control our politicians and they control hillary clinton and its never ever going to happen take a look at new york state when she was a senator from new york state she campaigned by saying that she was going to bring jobs back to new york state new york state is a disaster she got elected she did nothing she said see you later in four years she got elected take a look at what happened to new york state the jobs left the jobs left worse than just about any place in the country she didnt do a thing it was all talk and no action and thats whats going to happen here shes all talk shes no action believe me she wouldnt know a job if it stared her in the face i will be  i will be the greatest jobs president that god ever created that i can tell you  and by the way is there any place better safer or more fun to be than at a trump rally  having a good time so all the people who got nafta wrong and by the way signed by bill clinton perhaps the worst trade deals ever made in the history not of the country in the history of the world theres never been a deal so bad as nafta its a oneway highway out of this country for our jobs and for our money and were going to renegotiate that one very quickly let me tell you  and then you look at whats happening with china and theyre trying to give us the transpacific partnership now which will be a total disaster  that hillary clinton called the gold standard barack obama wants it hes pressing it it will be and i say this nothing can be as bad as nafta but its going to be pretty close so i just want to tell you were not approving the transpacific partnership just another catastrophe  our trade deficit with the world with the world all this work our trade deficit with the world is almost  billion a year you think we have good negotiators   weve lost onethird of our manufacturing jobs since bill and hillary clinton gave us nafta china is manipulating its currency and taking our jobs thats called cheating and believe me i have great relationships with china done many deals with china made a fortune with china have the largest bank in the world which is from china as one of my tenants theyre excellent and they just renewed their lease i cant believe it but they just   sell lots of condos to china we can do great with china and im not blaming china im blaming our leaders for being so stupid    were going to stop companies    from leaving our country and keep those jobs right here in pensacola  but right here in america  the era of economic surrender is over  we will also have a very very strong border  that stops people and drugs and those drugs are poisoning our youth and poisoning our people from illegally pouring into our country and we will build a wall and mexico will pay for the wall  were losing our jobs folks were losing our jobs and its all so easy when a company makes a product and they fire all their people in the united states and they announce theyre moving as an example to mexico we have to let them know there are consequences when they think theyre going to sell their product back into our country very simple  and when we tell them the consequences are a  percent tax to cross a now very strong border when we become president and the border patrol agent  endorsed donald trump theyve never done that before never done it before for a presidential candidate  and when these companies that want to leave and then think theyre going to sell their product to us no problem just come across the suckers you know they call us the suckers not going to happen and let me tell you when they hear there is a tax to pay to get their product into the country guess what theyre not going to be leaving folks  percent theyre never leaving right now youre being drained as you stand here tonight you have companies from this area and from all areas of the country negotiating deals to move out of the united states let me tell you something when im president thats not going to happen so easy so easy  so easy and the reason other people dont bring it up including your wonderful politicians and including your socalled leader if you can call him a leader  if you can call him a leader  is that theyre controlled by their donors and their special interests so they dont want it brought up theyll talk about it but theyre not going to do anything me im not controlled folks me im not controlled  were going to take care of that were going to take care of that situation so quickly and youre going to be so happy and youre going to know youre going to have your company here for a long time believe me in this new future we are going to raise your wages youre going to have competition people are going to be looking for employees theyre going to be looking companies  companies are going to be looking for people to work in that company right now you cant get a job and all our good jobs are gone household incomes are over  less today than they were  years ago think of it my tax trade energy immigration regulation reform which is a huge problem well get your salaries and your wages up up up remember  many people  years ago in this room were making more money in wage they were making more money than theyre making today and today theyre working two jobs now theyre getting older and theyre working harder its supposed to be the other way so were going to bring your jobs back youre going to have your choice and youre going to do very well and youre going to say november th was a very important day  very important day"
70,"Trump","thank you very much oh jon jon is such a great actor and such a great person he is such a great person and hes really been with me a long time in a lot of different ways hes been incredible so i just want to thank jon and i hope he makes another movie very quickly because i love his movies in particular i wanted to thank our host tony perkins for his years of leadership and we know all about that  and we all express our support for tony as he deals with the aftermath of the terrible floods in louisiana where two weeks ago i spent some time and i saw some incredible incredible people   right thank you amazing amazing people one of the greatest privileges of my journey has been the time ive spent with the evangelical community and the support they gave me in those primaries was absolutely incredible i have to tell you  all across the nation a lot of people said i wonder if donald will get the evangelicals i got the evangelicals  im gonna make it up to you too you watch there are no more decent voters or selfless people than our christian brothers and sisters here in the united states so true ive witnessed that incredible generosity all across this land    gotten to know so many people i     during my trip to louisiana where christian volunteers raced to help their fellow citizens in need franklin graham is an example he brought the most incredible people and equipment to louisiana  and he didnt want anything for it hes a great man its that spirit of giving that we will need to rebuild louisiana and to rebuild this country which is in serious serious trouble  yet our media culture often mocks and demeans people of faith and you understand that all the time i hear from concerned parents how much harder it is for a christian family to raise their children in todays media environment it is right isnt it it is right not even close  your values of love charity and faith built this nation  so how can it be that our media treats people of faith so poorly one of the reasons is that our politicians have really abandoned you to a large extent and hillary clinton you can forget about her  so let me state this right upfront a trump administration our christian heritage will be cherished protected defended like youve never seen before  believe me i believe and you believe it and you know it you know it and that includes religious liberty remember remember i recently had a chance to visit a church in detroit great faith ministries international stand up if youre a member thats good that was a great  that was an amazing experience  and the bishop what a great guy in my remarks i spoke     about how african american church and this is all across the country for centuries have been the conscience of our nation their unbreakable faith and spirit overcame some of the most difficult periods in our history leading us all to a better future its very true amazing this was such an amazing experience this is the power of faith its the power to heal its the power to unite its the power to make all of us live better lives all of us  our nation today is divided nobody likes to say it but were living in a very very divided nation it will be our faith in god in his teachings in each other that will lead us back to unity  each of us here today has a role to play in bringing our country together united in common purpose and in common values so lets talk today about some of the things and these are great things that we can do together to create the american future for everybody not just a certain group of people but for everybody the first thing we have to do is give our churches their voice back its been taken away  the johnson amendment has blocked our pastors and ministers and others from speaking their minds from their own pulpits if they want to talk about christianity if they want to preach if they want to talk about politics theyre unable to do so  if they want to do it they take a tremendous risk that they lose their taxexempt status all religious leaders should be able to freely express their thoughts and feelings on religious matters and i will repeal the johnson amendment if i am elected your president i promise  so important thank you thats so important and i must tell you from the heart this started  a building of mine in manhattan i had  pastors in a big conference room and we actually had  pastors two rabbis a couple of priests we were all talking and we were there for two hours and at the end it was a love fest we all agreed it was like a love fest and i said to them  we were high up in a building on fifth avenue and i said to them id love your support and i know when i can get support im quite sophisticated and i know they wanted to give me their total support  percent just like i had in the primaries and i said i really would like your support and they didnt really know what i was talking about and i said whats going on here they said well sir we cant do that because we would be violating the laws and i said whats the punishment well we could lose our taxexempt status which of course is a massive penalty i said tell me about this and we sat down and they talked about it when did it happen  or so lyndon johnson was having problems powerful guy i actually as his own  way have to gain respect for what he was able to do can you imagine that this man singlehandedly  he was having problems with churches and there was a church in houston that was giving him a hard time maybe for a very good reason and he put in an amendment that basically stopped our great pastors and ministers and others from talking under the penalty of losing their taxexempt status so we were looking down onto the sidewalk and there were people walking on the sidewalk and i said so folks what youre telling me is those people walking way way down there on the sidewalk have really more power than you do because theyre allowed to express their feelings and thoughts openly and without penalty and one of the pastors who i knew very well  and these are powerful people these are strong people with magnificent voices and just  and magnificent hearts much more importantly they looked at me and they said thats actually right they have more power than we do were not allowed to express and thats when i said we have to start thinking about this and i thought about it and then we had a large group of pastors again i said i have thought about it if i become president we are going to knock out the johnson amendment we are going to do that and its not going to be hard  its not going to be hard when you  when you think from the standpoint of political you have more than men  lets say men are  percent women are  percent youre much more than  percent added together and i actually believe thats one of the reasons why you havent seen christianity and other religions within the united states going like a rocket ship like our polls have been going in the last four weeks a rocket ship right   i really believe that because youre great people the people that you rely on sunday and all during the week theyve been stopped from talking and speaking by a law and were going to get rid of that law  its going to get rid of  were going to get rid of it so fast and im so proud to say honestly i dont want to take credit     but you had  people in that first meeting and many more in the second i am so proud i was just telling this to tony  to say that was my idea i figure its the only way im getting to heaven so this is going to very  the only way so were going to get rid of it and were going to let your great people speak and youre going to see something happen thats going to be very very good ok so important i hope  which means you have to get out and vote on november  you cannot  you didnt vote four years ago you didnt vote you didnt well you did a few of you did  believe me i know i look at the stats you didnt vote but this time you really have  and this is your last chance this is it i mean well never have this opportunity again so i hope you can get every one of your friends and just get up your family and your friends and get out and vote ok november   thank you and if you do were going to win by a lot thats not going to even be a close election if you dont could be a very unhappy november  were also going to repeal and replace disastrous obamacare  which gives the government control over the lives of every day citizens and the numbers are horrendous your premiums are going up by    percent the deductible is so high you never get to use it unless you are going to  a very long and very complex bad period very very long it is a disaster its a disaster and everybody knows that that its going to die of its own weight anyway but were going to get rid of it and were going to replace it with some great great alternatives a much better healthcare at a much lower price  hillary clinton wants to have completely government run healthcare which would be a disaster for the liberties and freedoms of all america this is what she wants thats what shes aiming at thats what obama wanted he didnt quite there but he got this and you see how bad this has been one of the biggest issues in this race is going to be the issue of school choice  and i cant possibly emphasize this enough millions of poor and disadvantaged students are trapped in failing schools this education crisis afflicts all communities but none more so than the african american community none the democratic party has run the inner cities of america for    years some cases over  years over  years their policies and their politics and in particular the politics of people like hillary clinton have produced only poverty joblessness and rising crime  when she was running for the senate in new york state she said she was gonna produce jobs jobs jobs in upstate new york its a disaster she could have produced jobs big thing jobs were gonna bring back jobs gonna  catastrophe weve lost tens of thousands of jobs  she never did a thing it was all talk no action just like what shes doing right now is all talk and no action shell talk and talk and nothing will happen only bad will happen but you just have to ask the people in upstate new york  she won because of them and she produced absolutely nothing jobs left its today one of the worst one of the most depressing places in this country so just remember that when you hear her talking about jobs i know jobs she doesnt know jobs that i can tell you  i have outlined a new civil rights agenda for our time the right to a safe community a great education and a secure job and i say to africanamerican parents i say to hispanicamerican parents and i say it with great respect our inner cities are a disaster crime no jobs education is the worst in many cases almost worldwide bad and in many cases actually worldwide bad i say with great respect what do you have to lose it cant get any worse it cant get any worse you choose donald trump im gonna fix the problem youre gonna have safety youre gonna have good education were gonna get jobs because were gonna bring our jobs back mexicos taken our jobs so many other places have taken our jobs what chinas doing to us is horrible well have jobs what have you got to lose im gonna fix it im gonna fix it  school choice is at the center of this civil rights agenda and my goal is to provide every single inner city child in american that is trapped in a failing government school the freedom to attend the school of their choice competition and the schools will get better and better and better  and if that means a private school a religious school or a charter school or a magnet school  school choice also means that parents can home school their children  hundred percent  hillary clinton opposes school choice because shes controlled totally totally like a puppet by special interests her policies will force millions of africanamerican and hispanic children to remain stuck in failed government schools leading to higher unemployment and more poverty the poverty levels in this country nobody will believe nobody will believe my plan will break the government monopoly and make schools compete to provide the best services for our children including every africanamerican and hispanic child in this country every single one of them   this proposal begins with a  billion block grant from the federal government to states to pursue school choice programs however  thats good right  however because  percent of education spending is at the state level i will campaign to get the states to reallocate another  billion of their education budgets to school choice programs if we do this that would mean  in school choice funds for every disadvantaged student in america what a difference this is going to make the money will follow the student to the public private or religious school that is best for them and their family in so many ways youre going to have a choice my administration will partner with the leadership of any inner city anybody anybody in the inner cities of america willing to run a pilot program  and there will be a lot of them  to provide school choice to every child in that community in baltimore for instance that would mean more than  in funds available per student as your president i will be the biggest cheerleader for school choice youve ever seen  this means a lot of me because i know it can turn things around again the education cant get worse common core were going to end it well bring in education  i will fight for every child in this country who deserve better futures the africanamerican community has heard my message that i am going to make the inner city safe again and im going to bring back jobs and im going to bring back the great education dont be surprised  remember this november eighth dont be surprised because we have been given a lot of support over the last three or four weeks if on november eighth i get more africanamerican and hispanic votes than anyone thought possible about a month ago you see whats going on theyre starting  people are starting to hear about this and they say wow wow theyre liking it and again cant get any worse its going to get a lot better but only if i do they cant do it the  the democrats they have what theyve done is incredible and hillary clinton will be absolutely more of the same rigid itll never change remember  years  years  its not going to change not going to happen now lets talk about another issue that will define the future of this country for generations to come the united states supreme court  earlier this year we lost the great justice antonin scalia the next president will not only have to fill this seat but as many as four others it could even be  i mean we could end up with a total of five judges by one president it would be recordsetting probably be three could be four could even be five and you pick the wrong people you have a country that is no longer your country it will be a disaster one of the most important issues frankly other than maybe defense  because were going to build up our military its so depleted were going to take care of our vets were going to protect your second amendment so many things  but one of the most important  some people think its actually the most important  is the filling of the seats united states supreme court you see whats happening right now essentially its four and four and you see what  how bad it is were going to pick great judges ive already put a list of  federalist society highly recommended got uniform great on these  people and we are going to put truly great people  maybe we use judge scalia as the ultimate example of what we are looking for ok  this will determine whether or not we remain a constitutional republic frankly thats whats going to happen i have pledged to appoint judges who uphold the constitution to protect your religious liberty and apply the law as written  we reject judges who rewrite the constitution to impose their own personal views on  millionplus americans not going to have that ive made public a list of judges as i said that will guide my selection process hillary clinton has refused to provide such a list and we brought it up  lets see a list if you ever saw the list you would walk out of here not feeling very well  because she knows the extremist judges she would pick would be rejected by the overwhelming majority of the american public theyd be rejected clintons judicial picks would allow her to completely take over american healthcare the american economy and americans religious liberty not to mention your second amendment which is on very thin ice right now as you know because of the fact that were fourfour if they even pick one judge whos wrong you can probably as you know it you can kiss the second amendment goodbye and we dont want to see that another issue in this race of great importance to everyone in this room is the issue of course of national security just today it was announced that north korea performed its fifth nuclear test its forth since hillary clinton became secretary of state its just one more massive failure from a failed secretary of state  she failed at everything her policies have also put iran onto a path of nuclear weapons and i have to say made them overnight an absolute power they were dying three years ago the sanctions were choking them they would have fallen but obama didnt support people that would have taken over and i think in this case probably would have taken over the right way they had no support but look at whats happened to iran in such a short period of time but remember the ransom payments remember it was  million two weeks ago but then they made a mistake this is cash remember they said they paid cash because they couldnt open a bank account there was no way of sending it into a checking account  all lies just like obamacare was a big lie remember you can use your plan you can use your doctors  times right twenty seven times use your doctors use your plan it turned out to be a lie its all a lie its all a big lie its a rigged system and its a lie  and ill tell you what  ill tell you what the  million for those that havent been reading the papers over the last two days turned out to be  billion in cash cash and i actually said  they said that moneys going to be used for terror i said no they dont need it for terror theyve got  billion thats in addition to the  billion we gave them back i said they dont need it this is going into their swiss accounts and going into their accounts theyre not going to use it for terror they have plenty of money for terror think of it  billion cash massive big vats of cash you saw them cartons never saw anything like it ive seen a lot of cash  never saw anything like this   billion can you imagine these guys planes get  they stop remember they wouldnt give back the hostages they waited there for hours and hours and obama kept saying no no this has nothing to do even the hostages said they kept us waiting for a certain plane to come in not to take them back because they were waiting for something it was this just another lie but can you imagine these people sitting there and they see  billion in cash oy oy oy they think were stupid they think were stupid they wont be thinking it for long  at the same time isis is hunting down and exterminating what it calls the nation of the cross isis is carrying out a genocide against christians in the middle east we cannot let this evil continue cant let it isis must be destroyed have to have no choice  to defeat isis we must use military warfare but also cyber warfare financial warfare and ideological warfare its a whole different ballgame today than it was  years ago and  years ago different world we must also establish a bipartisan goal in the united states and an international goal with our allies of defeating radical islamic terrorism  words that our president wont use and words that hillary clinton wont use just like we won the cold war by identifying our enemy and building a consensus to guide a longterm strategy so too must we do the same with islamic terrorism by the way president obama has allowed syrian refugees to pour into our country at unbelievable rates and hillary clinton wants to allow  percent more but its almost impossible to get a christian in from syria they take others but they dont take christians very rare very rare  so i said that we need to make safe zones in the region we want to take care of people but we absolutely cannot allow this potential tremendous threat to continue and we have to stop this this is going to be potentially a catastrophe for our country its from within this could be the alltime great trojan horse this could be it you ever notice on the  you look at the migration trail and you see people with cell phones cell phones and some of the cell phones have the isis flag printed on them and some of them have things far worse than that scenes far worse than that so it was the failed policies you have to remember of hillary clinton and obama that unleashed isis in the first place if they did the right thing you wouldnt be talking about isis right now now she wants to get rid of them oh were going to get rid of them she tells them already there will be no boots on the ground now even if you even dont want boots on the ground you dont want to say it dont say it now theyre saying oh i hope she wins oh boy would they dream of having her as president can you imagine they dream about it every night having hillary clinton but even if you believe it  and i can understand that no boots on the ground i can understand you dont say it let them think theyre going to go through hell dont say it  can you imagine the great general douglas macarthur can you imagine the great general george patton or one of our great generals that we have today general flynn whos here someplace i love general flynn  but can you imagine these people saying i mean theyre basically giving out the strategy there will be no boots on the ground if you dont want that i fully understand dont say it dont say it can you imagine macarthur saying were going to fight the enemy and were going to move our troops in about a month were going to hit from behind  were going to hit them from the front but  and everything they say turns out to be true you know i hate to say this because we have a lot of evangelicals in this room but maybe we shouldnt be so honest when it comes to military strategy does that make sense  hope i didnt lose your vote for saying that  just look at what her policies have left us with in iraq syria and libya the problem is hillary clinton is trigger happy she really is shes trigger happy and yet she says no boots which is sort of  probably will be boots you know probably will turn out to be another disaster her tenure has brought us only war and destruction and death shes just too quick to intervene invade or to push for regime change with people we dont even know who they are and they take over and theyre far worse this creates the power vacuums that are filled by terrorists and groups like isis my administration on the other hand will work with any country that is willing to partner with us to defeat isis and halt radical islamic terrorism and by the way that includes russia if they want to join us on knocking out isis that is just fine as far as im concerned  its a very imperfect world and you cant always choose your friends life but you can never fail to recognize your enemies and we have some real enemies unfortunately for our country our enemies probably hacked into hillary clintons emails these are the same emails she destroyed after receiving a federal subpoena whats that  using software in order to bleach the email so you can never ever see then she even mysteriously lost  different phones before the fbi got them and many were destroyed with a hammer   did anybody ever hit a hammer  you know maybe two or three people but they were just released from prison those two people  can you believe this destroyed them with a hammer the old fashioned way i guess  the other night in the commanderinchief forum  did anybody see that how did i do  good well we have a big debate coming up who knows whats going to happen there but i will say every poll has me winning big league the commanderinchief we had  the polls came out after that event and we won big league now we have a debate coming up i dont imagine any of you are going to be watching the debate  i wont i promise hillary clinton answered questions on her e mails horribly thats why she lost thats why she did so poorly she was terrible she was  honestly i shouldnt be saying this she was terrible  she keeps talking about the emails every time she talks about them she talks about them differently it seems each week  true  she has like a different answer but there can be no answer when she deletes  emails bleaches them so they can never be recovered an unheard of practice hammers them into total silence you know whats happening you know whats happening i always say getting away with that will be the single greatest accomplishment of her career its true its true  so her answers were bad they were bad and a lot of people said it was so totally dishonest and you know she was blaming matt lauer i thought matt lauer did a very good job i mean his questions to me were very tough but the gentleman who stood up and said honestly you should be in prison for what you did to me that was the tough one that was the tough  that was a tough question well sort of a question in the form of a statement right  clinton is unfit to be our president for many reasons  true   shes unfit for many reasons the biggest of which is her judgment its just so bad its time to restore honesty and integrity to our government we have to do it   and one more issue  final issue i wanted to discuss today is the economy and helping those in need there is no more charitable group in this country than christians and all of us  true  and all of us here today determined to lift suffering americans out of poverty were going to do it with  a lot of other people are going to help as your president i will pursue a complete reform of our economy to bring back millions of new jobs into our country millions of new jobs weve lost our jobs like were a bunch of babies theyve gone to other countries theyve gone to mexico theyve gone to many other countries chinas taking massive advantage of us its all so easy believe me its all so easy that includes we will be doing massive tax cuts for working families and for businesses  it includes very importantly the elimination of all needless jobkilling regulations  it includes lifting the restrictions on america energy which is under siege i will also renegotiate nafta and if they dont want to renegotiate it so it becomes a twoway highway not just a oneway highway out of the united states for our companies and our jobs we will terminate nafta believe me  well stand up to china and were going to fight for every last job its going to be america first and its going to be the american worker first  crucially i will also fight for the american family and american family values the family must be at the center of any antipoverty agenda has to be  thank you our country just lost one of the great champions for the american family phyllis schlafly great woman really great woman  we send our thoughts and prayers to her loved ones i will be going to her funeral tomorrow in st louis  phyllis fought very hard to the very end for a free and prosperous america she understood that to be truly united as a country we cant simply turn to government or to politicians the bedrock of our unity is the realization that were all brothers and sisters created by the same god phyllis understood that phyllis understood  and by the way phyllis endorsed me a long time ago when it wasnt necessarily something that was so easy to do and she was incredible she was so brave she endorsed me and that was not the thing to do at the time people said trump she said hes going to win you dont understand he knows how to win hes going to win they said phyllis not going to be trump and we went boom boom boom  but i will tell you phyllis endorsed me at a time when it wasnt necessarily the thing to do even the popular thing to do and i will never forget that that had a huge impact she was a great great powerful woman with a tremendous heart and i look forward to being with her family tomorrow because you really  thats a celebration she was  years old  were all equal and we all come from the same creator if we remember that simple fact then our future is truly limitless there is nothing we as americans cant do theres a biblical verse that ive often read and i want to repeat it again because i think it is so important to what were trying to achieve right now for our country its from first john chapter four no one has ever seen god but if we love one another god lives in us and his love is made complete in us so true  so true imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as one people under one god saluting one flag  its time to stop quibbling over the smallest words and time to start dreaming about the great adventures that lie ahead for our country this is my promise to all of you starting in  we will be one american nation its time to break our ties with the bitter failures of the past and to embrace a new american future have to do it together we will make america believe again we will make america united again and we will make america great again thank you much and god bless you thank you thank you thank you very much"

given it in  years for  years shes been here why hasnt she given change she never will in a million years he wont do it  i will be speaking more about hillary clintons disqualifying remarks in a minute but first let me invite on to the stage some of our wonderful supporters who can tell you themselves what they think of her very horrible statements that she made three days ago folks come on up   these are not deplorable people that i can tell you come on over      come on up ill pick at random who wants to speak come on        come on    and dont forget were going to protect our second amendment were going to repeal and replace horrible obamacare  and never ever forget supreme court justices never   come on up       wow wow thats  isnt that great and these people are so representative of everybody throughout our country so i have some thoughts on clintons remarks and ill be sharing them momentarily but first i want to tell you what im going to do to make america far better than it is right now and you know theres room to make america great again weve outlined the detailed plan on trade on immigration build a wall were going to build a wall were going to build a wall  and who is going to pay for the wall hundred percent hundred percent they may not know it yet but theyre paying for the wall on rebuilding the military on changing our foreign policy ive delivered a plan on defeating islamic terrorism on reforming our tax code on unleashing american energy and on providing school choice to every disadvantage child in america weve released policy after policy solution after solution every day were putting forward new ideas to make your life better we need change we have to have change and it has to happen quickly were going in the wrong direction like nobody has ever thought possible the change will start right away the moment i take my oath of office right away  on my first day were going to immediately terminate every single unconstitutional executive order signed by president obama  then im going to order a review of every single regulation issued over the last eight years all needless jobkilling regulations will be canceled  millions of new jobs will come pouring in were going to lift restrictions on american energy this will create another half a million new jobs a year and thats just the beginning on my first day in office i am going to ask congress to send me a bill to immediately repeal and replace i just said it obamacare  and this will save another two million jobs it is a disaster you see whats happening your premiums are going through the roof your deductibles are so high youll never get to use it hopefully because the only way youll use it is it has to be a long slow death youll never get to use it i am also going to propose a massive tax cut to unleash prosperity in every city and every state in our country big tax code   im going to instruct the department of commerce to immediately begin a review of all foreign trade practices that unfairly hurt american manufacturing you know whats happening to your area i will use every lawful presidential power to achieve relief for our workers and were going to protect our workers not like its been for a long time now our workers are going to come first we are going to protect our workers  you can read the full sevenpoint trade plan on my website but i have to tell you when it comes to trade were going to renegotiate some of those horrible deals and boy is nafta bad north carolina has lost more than  in  manufacturing jobs since nafta think of that  in   percent bill clinton signed it and hillary clinton supported it and its been perhaps the worst trade deal ever signed not only in this country but actually in the history of the world theres never been a deal like this its a oneway street out of the united states and into mexico and other countries not going to be that way anymore folks right here in asheville youve lost one in five manufacturing jobs since china joined the world trade organization another hillary back disaster hillary clinton owes all of you an apology and i think youll get that apology right around the same time that she hands over the  emails that she delivered  and by the way hillary destroyed her emails after think of this after she received a congressional subpoena and nothing happened she gets a subpoena and she said destroy them whats going on they used a special software that most people even sophisticated people in that world dont even know about they bleached them she even made her  different phones disappear and some of them she hammered with a hammer   explain that one ive never done that  she obviously had a whole lot to hide including her payforplay scandals as secretary of state payforplay with ubs with russian uranium with contracts for her friends and her family in haiti nothing is so dangerous to american democracy as when a public official puts their federal office up for sale and thats what happened here thats what happened here hillary believes shes above the law but she also believes and you know this she really believes that she is above the law and so far shes turned out to be what happened to our laws after months of hiding from the press hillary clinton came out and finally told the world how she feels about the people of this country she said tens of millions of patriotic americans are a basket of deplorable how can you be president  how can you be president for so many people she talks about people like theyre objects not human beings she said half of our supporters are irredeemable and not american and describes the other half as having run out of options what she cant understand or accept is that the great majority of this country now sees right through these lies and deceptions of a failed political establishment and frankly soon to be a failed politician   the people want change they want justice and they want a government that puts the american people first whether our supporters have lost a job to a factory that moved to another country or whether a captain in the police department or teacher at a local school theyre united by their deep and sophisticated understanding of how our political system has abandoned the people our system folks is rigged its a word ive been using for a long time and now its picked up by everybody theyre all using it but our system is rigged for those who have been hit by hard times they understand better than anyone that its clintons wall street agenda that has crushed the middle class of this country crushed it hillary clinton spoke with hatred in her heart for these workingclass americans absolute hatred in her heart could we have a doctor please a doctor a doctor please thank you a doctor thank you thank you doctor thank you it is about  degrees in here folks thank you so much we love our supporters right lets give her a hand yes get some water please water kevin get

thank you darling and whether it was a supporter or not were going to take care of him thats what were talking about right right thats what were talking and it is pretty hot in here folks its like pretty hot hillary looks down on people all the people and frankly these are people that have been so unbelievable for our country she looks down on the carpenters and the plumbers and the electricians she looks down on police officers and soldiers and firefighters and everybody supporting our campaign and we have large chunks we have everybody supporting us folks everybody we have people that have been so successful we have some that havent quite been as successful let me tell you we have everybody because everybody knows what a mess our country is in she looks down on the people who cook your meals driver your cars and dig the call that power her electricity what shes done to the minors is unbelievable obama and clinton have destroyed the lives of the minors that i can tell you and the steelworkers our next and you see that coming she called these americans every name in the book racist sexist xenophobic islamophobic she said they were not even american right anybodys xenophobic i dont think so i dont think so never in history has a major party presidential candidate so viciously demonized the american voter she was attacking millions of moms and dads who love their children and want a better future for all americans thats what they want watching these parents tell their children about hillary clintons attacks  let me ask you this question is there any place in america more fun to be than a trump rally right right no place no place watching these parents tell their children about hillarys attacks to every kid in america tonight i want you to know that your parents are working so hard to make your life better and to make your country better  its ok the cameras are following us that is why   see now the dishonest media will not report that they

money in real wages  years ago than they do today and theyre working harder today and theyve got two jobs not going to happen clinton made remarks at a highdollar fundraiser in wall street her goal is simple to bully the american voter out of voting for change the people who rigged the system want to keep things exactly as they are its been very good they want to keep our terrible trade deals and they are terrible they dont want renegotiation because theyre on the other side of a lot of those horrible deals that are moving to mexico and other places they like them just fine but its killing the american job they want to trap children and failing government schools they want massive regulation to keep small businesses from being able to compete with other businesses all over the world hillary clinton can never be president of this country not   what she just said shows what a low opinion she has of the american people we just cant let that happen folks we cant let it happen you got to get out november th you got to get out october th you start sending in those votes you got to do it earlier today i had a chance to spend some time with some of our most amazing americans i spent the afternoon with the national guard association of the united states incredible people these are the heroes who rescue our people in disasters and who fight in our wars these heroes are a permanent testament to the courage and character of our nation we also honor and remember the lives of the service members who have made the ultimate sacrifice there is no greater love than the love shown by the men and women who have laid down their lives for this country and for its people nothing greater than that our debt to them is eternal and everlasting let me also pause for a moment to recognize shelby county police officer tim brackeen who was shot in the line of duty and died today leaving behind a wife and beautiful child we mourn this terrible loss that we pledge to always stand with our incredible police and law enforcers  in addition to supporting our law enforcement we must also ensure that our men and women in the armed services have the best equipment resources and tools anywhere in the world we dont anymore we dont we are totally depleted we have the greatest people on earth but our military services are depleted with the bad equipment the old equipment its a terrible thing thats happened we must provide them with the best medical care while they serve and the best medical care when they return home to civilian life the veteran scandals that have occurred under this administration and that have been dismissed by my opponent are a permanent stain on our government its just one more way hillary clinton only looks out for herself we must take care of our veterans and that includes giving veterans a card that gives them the right to choose treatment in either public va facilities or the private doctor of their choice i have to do it   you look at whats happening where people are waiting on line five days six days seven days  days and theyre dying  suicides a day  suicides a day who can even believe that number when a simple solution could be at hand a prescription a small operation and theyre dying and theyre killing themselves and theyve done so much for us its not going to happen any longer believe me just today we learned that the va has violated a federal law by failing to make its performance records available to consumers the scandals never seem to end but they will end when im elected president and it will end quickly   and hillary clinton was quoted fairly recently as saying the va is fine the va is working not working hillary ive got to know so many veterans believe me its not working nothing makes me more proud than to have the support of the men and women who wear the uniform   weve received endorsements from  generals and admirals these are the people who know how to keep our country safe these are our fighters these are our great great fighters so i want to thank each and every one of them and there are more coming just today i was profoundly humbled to gain the endorsement of  medal of honor recipients   and i cant even begin to say how much it means to me to have their support these are truly great heroes also today i was thrilled to announce that ambassador r james woolsey former head of the cia one of the most respected people anywhere in our government is now a senior advisor to our campaign this is one of the most respected people great man we are on a mission of change and that includes a new agenda for our inner cities our inner cities folks our inner cities are a mess the democratic party has run the inner cities for    and even a hundred years straight democratic politicians like clinton disrespect these voters and take them for granted they want the vote and they say see you in four years they do nothing remember hillarys words super predator remember that remember those words super predator those are her words nearly four in  africanamerican children live in poverty including listen to this  percent of those under the age of six they live in poverty their schools are failing and  percent of africanamerican youths are not employed approximately  people have been shot in chicago since the beginning of the year for those suffering and hurting i say give donald trump a chance i will fix it what do you have to lose you have nothing to lose it cant get any worse it cant get any worse you can go to war  and you know this is true you can go to afghanistan you can go to wartorn countries and you will find that its safer than being in the middle of some of our inner cities were going to give security and safety were going to give education were going to get jobs were going to bring our jobs back from mexico and all of these countries that have been stealing our job were going to get people working and were going to love it i will fight for detroit and chicago

africanamerican people i say it again and again i will fix it and really what do you have to lose it cant get any worse what do you have to lose i will fix it  imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as one people under one god saluting one american flag one american flag  whats going on today folks whats going on today its time to break with the bitter failures of the past and to embrace the new american future this is a future we will respect the dignity of all americans and that means great jobs great schools and great neighborhoods and it also

72,"Trump","thank you very much  it is a great honor and i am very very grateful being here today in front of so many distinguished people ive met more generals than ive ever seen in my life  i like them and they like me a lost endorsements i can tell you my special gratitude to general ashenhurst and general hargett and to each and everyone of you thank you very much  thank you guys the national guard of the united states has defended this nation at war kept our citizens safe at home and rushed into danger wherever it has threatened our people our debt to you is eternal yesterday was the th anniversary of the  attacks the national guard was sent to assist in the aid and recovery and these are serious serious bad days for our country the recovery efforts at ground zero in new york city  and i was there and i know what you went through since  there have been  members of the national guard deployed overseas including those with multiple deployments right now  members of the national guard are in iraq afghanistan and many other countries all across the world and doing an unbelievable job members of the national guard come from all walks of life working every kind of job imaginable and juggle a thousand different challenges as they raise their kids serve their states and answer the call of duty for their country i am given the honor to serve as your president which i think will happen and were going to soon find out  we hope and if it does happen i will pledge to give you the resources the equipment and the support you need and deserve and that youre not getting  you will have a true and loyal friend in the white house whether you vote for me or whether you vote for someone else i will be your greatest champion i will not let you down i am running to be a president for all americans and ive been especially humbled to have the support of so many of our men and women in uniform  all americans you know what i mean all across this country ive met so many incredible members of both our military and law enforcement community theres nothing ive enjoyed more than the time ive spent with our service members police officers and also our firefighters and paramedics these are incredible people they embody the goodness and decency of our country i was thus deeply shocked and alarmed this friday to hear my opponent attack slander smear demean these wonderful amazing people who are supporting our campaign by the millions our support comes from every part of america and every walk of life we have the support of cops and soldiers carpenters and welders the young and the old and millions of working class families who just want a better future and a good job these were the people hillary clinton so viciously demonized these were among the countless americans that hillary clinton called deplorable irredeemable and unamerican nobodys heard anything like this she called these patriotic men and women every vile name in the book she called them racist sexist xenophobic islamophobic she called half of our supporters a basket of deplorable in both the speech and in interview she divides people into baskets as though they were objects not human beings hillary clinton made these comments at one of her highdollar fundraisers on wall street she and her wealthy donors all had a good laugh you heard them they were all laughing good good solid laugh they were laughing at the very people who paved the roads  i mean and these are the roads that she with all of her security drive on  paint the buildings she speaks in and importantly all of the other functions i mean if you think all functions in life including this auditorium and its maintenance hillary clinton is an insider supported by powerful insiders attacking americans who have absolutely no political power hillary clinton spoke with hatred and derision for the people who make this country run she spoke with contempt for the people who thanklessly follow the rules pay their taxes and scratch out a living for their family a hardearned living too  while hillary clinton lives a sequestered life behind gates and walls and guards she mocks and demeans hardworking americans who only want their own families to enjoy a fraction of the security enjoyed by our politicians after months of hiding from the press hillary clinton has revealed her true thoughts  that was her true thoughts she revealed herself to be a person who looks down on the proud citizens of our country as subjects for her rule she views it as her rule her comments displayed the same sense of arrogance and entitlement that led to violation of federal law as secretary of state hide and delete her emails  nobodys ever done anything like that before  put classified information in the reach of our enemies lied to congress and selled  government favors of access through her foundation its the same attitude that explains why hillary clinton refuses to take accountability for the deadly disaster she helped to create in iraq in syria and in libya to this day she wont take accountability for her role in unleashing  and thats what happened  unleashing isis across the middle east or for putting iran on a path to nuclear weapons and as far as isis is concerned probably unleashing isis here we better be very very smart tough and vigilant or were going to have big problems hillary clinton believes shes above the law that she is above accountability and that she is above each and every one of you our campaign is about giving voice to the voiceless its about representing the forgotten men and women of this country and they have been forgotten im here to represent everyone but especially those who are struggling against injustice and unfairness i am running so that the powerful can no longer beat up on the powerless im running to take on the special interests the big donors and the corrupt political insiders and of course never forget the special interests i am running to be your voice hillary clinton is a voice for wall street for hedge fund managers for top  really the top ten percent and really the top one percent and even less than that just look at the people funding hillary clintons campaign and paying for her speeches tremendous amounts of money and you know who she will be representing if she ever won which i dont believe is going to happen  in fact if you look at the recent polls the ones over the last few days were doing very well that i can tell you  the disdain that hillary clinton expressed toward millions of decent americans disqualifies her from public service you cannot run for president if you have such contempt in your heart for the american voter and she does you cant lead this nation if you have such a low opinion for its citizens  hillary clinton still hasnt apologized to those she slandered in fact she hasnt backed down at all shes doubled down on her campaign conspiracy and contempt if hillary clinton will not retract her comments in full i dont see how she can credibly campaign any further lets be clear these were not offhand comments from hillary clinton these were  remarks not at all they were given also in an interview and probably a number of interviews these were lengthy planned and prepared remarks it was perhaps the most explicit attack on the american voter ever spoken by a major party presidential nominee total disrespect for the people of our country clinton was using a very deliberate page from the democratic playbook smearing someone with one of the names you know those names in order  really in order to scare  and i mean try and seriously scare them out of voting for change and were bringing change she cant bring change shes been doing this for  years she now talks about change theres no change its going to be more of the same only worse its going to be four more years of barack obama only worse she just took it to a whole new level by applying it to tens of millions of people she used these vile words in order to bully and intimidate honest citizens out of seeking government reform and there will be reform there has to be reform people who want their immigration laws enforced  we have no choice we have to do that  and their borders secured are not racists they are patriotic americans of all backgrounds who want their jobs and families protected people who warn about radical islamic terrorism are not islamophobes theyre not they are decent american citizens who want to uphold our tolerant values and keep our country safe people who support police and who want crime reduced and stopped are not prejudiced and are not bad people  they are concerned and loving citizens whose hearts break every time an innocent child is lost and oftentimes killed to preventable violence and it is preventable hillary clinton doesnt have to worry about sanctuary cities or jobs moving overseas where so many are moving shes protected from her own policies the policies of hillary clinton have produced failing schools shrinking incomes and the tragic poverty and joblessness in our inner cities our inner cities are a disaster  our campaign is dedicated to changing these policies to make life better for all americans  we are the campaign of school choice we are the campaign dedicated to improving economic conditions for every african american and hispanic worker and we are doing amazingly well with african american and hispanic workers youve been seeing that over the last week we are the campaign that will deliver a government of by and for the people this change agenda includes a new foreign and new military policy we are going to put the failed policy of the past and there are many behind us ideally way behind us we will empower our generals to do the job they were hired to do and that begins with defeating and destroying isis  thank you instead of endless wars we want a real plan for victory  we will abandon the policy of reckless regime change favored by my opponent and we will instead work with our allies to advance the core national security interests of the united states america first remember that america first  my plan calls for a major rebuilding of the entire military and the elimination of the defense  and we have to do this so quickly its a disaster  of the defense sequester it is a disaster  have no choice it is a disaster its called depletion we have been depleted as a military we cant let that happen the greatest men and women on earth but we have been depleted by whats taken place in this rebuilding we will provide our national guard with the best modern stateoftheart equipment in the world bar none  the national guard is often the first and the last line of defense for our people you were there when the hurricanes and floods and tornadoes strike always amazes me the courage the care the love that you give amazing and the danger is beyond belief you were there to protect civilians in times of unrest you were there to respond to every natural disaster you deserve a government that recognizes and honors your contribution and that ensures you have the resources you need to get the job done and to get the job done right  in a trump administration the national guard will always have a direct line to the oval office and i mean direct  you will have an administration that never loses sight of the vital contribution you make each and every day you will have a president who supports promotes and speaks up for the national guard at every single turn  the incredible members of the national guard have sacrificed life and limb for our freedom our safety and our country we will never forget our heroes their families and the ones theyve left behind our gratitude is and will be everlasting we will protect those who protect us and we will follow your example of unity working in common purpose and for a common cause we will be one people under one god saluting one american flag  we will rebuild our military and our country we will make america strong again we will make america safe again and we together will make america great again thank you very much everybody god bless you thank you thank you  thank you everybody"
73,"Trump","with great people thank you very much thank you  we are making very big progress i can tell you that and in iowa virtually every poll has us ahead and we are going to win iowa  so i just wanna thank you i love being back here i have so many friends in iowa and ill tell you what i enjoyed the primaries and im enjoying this even more so thank you very much thank you very much  spending time here really has been one of the  really  and i can say this one of the great great joys of campaigning and especially with all of the friends weve developed so its fantastic  but heres whats most important together were gonna win iowa in november  to be specific november th we have to be specific and were going to win the white house and we are going to make america great again ok were going to make america great again  the white house will become the peoples house that will happen we will tackle and fix the problems that have gone unsolved for years and believe me there are many of them  were going to fix our crumbling infrastructure renegotiate our horrible trade deals they are disastrous free children from failing government schools eliminate government waste and create a fair simple and efficient tax code to add millions and millions or new jobs which we need  prosperity will rise poverty will recede and wages will finally begin to grow and they will grow rapidly if they dont ill be very disappointed in myself i will tell you this is a campaign about big ideas designed to help everyday people in recent days weve rolled out one new policy idea after another on taxes on school choice  so important  on foreign policy on defeating terrorisms on rebuilding our military on veterans care and unleashing american energy    oh were having a good time were having a good time go ahead go ahead theres always one    thank you men   all right you can get them thank you   thank you thank you very much thats great thats all right single person theyll end up with more publicity than all of you put together  so were going to unleash american energy were going to put those jobs back like you have not seen in your lifetimes you have not seen before by contrast hillary clinton is running a policyfree campaign she offers no ideas no solutions and only hatred and derision its true you saw that im running to be a president for all americans democrat republican independent everyone whether you vote for me  right  whether you vote for me or whether you vote for someone else i will be still your greatest champion right  our support comes from every part of american and from every walk of life we have the support of cops and soldiers and carpenters and welders and accountants and lawyers the young and the old and millions of working class families all over this nation we cover everybody this is a movement like nobodys ever seen before it really is its a movement  theyre considering it a great phenomena i consider it a great phenomena if we win on november th thats what i consider  well my opponent slanders you as deplorable and irredeemable i call you hardworking american patriots who love your country and want a better future for all of our people  her comments displayed the same sense of arrogance and entitlement that led her to violate federal law as secretary of state hide and delete her emails i mean think  emails and thats just one batch its a lot of wedding talk its a lot of wedding talk  put classified information in the reach of our enemies lied to congress and sell government favors and access through the clinton foundation its this attitude of arrogance that explains why hillary clinton made  phones disappear including with a hammer  so the fbi couldnt see them and why she bleached her emails after a congressional subpoena  thats after the subpoena came this isnt before thats after the subpoena came now the people who destroyed the emails are all pleading the fifth amendment in front of congress today how you seen have you seen whats going on in front of congress fifth amendment fifth amendment fifth amendment horrible horrible and will anything happen thats going to be the question were going to find out anyone watching todays hearing in congress knows that hillary clintons actions are far more corrupt that we ever imagined its happened today this is far bigger and a far bigger scandal than watergate ever was but with watergate we had justice we had a justice department that went after the people heres something that just  nobodys ever seen anything like this folks what were witnessing is a first weve never ever seen anything like this this is a scandal that threatens national security and that involves a multimilliondollar pay for play scheme between the secretary of state and her foundation  whether its her emails her disasters in iraq libya and syria or her failures on the economy of which its been disastrous hillary clinton lacks the judgment temperament and moral character to lead this country she does you know it everybody knows it  everybody knows it  everybody knows it in the words of a secret service agent posted outside her office she simply lacks the integrity and the temperament to serve in the office from the bottom of my soul he said i know this to be true the policies of hillary clinton have produced death destruction overseas its been disastrous no matter where you look everything shes touched has been a disaster and produced only failing schools rising crime job loss shrinking incomes and tragic poverty at home you want four more years of it   i had a feeling you might say that  its so sad to see whats going on in our country is so sad one in five american households do not have a single member in the labor force another  million people have left the labor force since  and the national debt has doubled to nearly  trillion during the obama years  im running to reverse these policies and to create a future of prosperity for all americans  all americans  that includes youll be happy to hear this our family farms right here in iowa  family farms  the farmers are being left out in the cold family farms are the backbone of this country we are going to end the epa intrusion into your family homes and your family farms  we are going to protect the renewable fuel standard cornbased ethanol eliminate jobkilling regulations like the waters of the us rule and provide desperately needed tax relief  our plan lowers the tax rate on family farms down to  percent from  percent and you watch your farms grow you watch businesses all over the country grow you watch jobs come back it will be a beautiful thing and remember this the double taxation of family farms at death you want to leave your farms to your children its a disaster because it doesnt happen so helping to ensure that the family farm we have to make and we have to continue the tradition in iowa we want it to continue to thrive with your family  and youll be looking down your family and youll be proud ok so were going to take care of that my economic agenda can be summed up in three words jobs jobs jobs  that means were going to negotiate trade deals to protect our farmers help them export their goods and make money doing it because the way it is now its impossible and grow family farming in america were going to grow the farms  my first day in office im also going to order a review of every single regulation issued over the last  years  all needless jobkilling regulations will be canceled  millions and millions of new jobs will come pouring into our country were going to lift the restrictions on american energy which means lower electricity prices for our farmers and a half a million jobs a year at least probably a number much higher than that and that will just be the beginning also on my first day im going to ask congress to send me a bill to immediately repeal and replace disastrous obamacare  this will instantly save another  million jobs at least probably more than that by the way remember jonathan gruber anybody remember that name  people forgot a long time ago but some people remember i see that jonathan gruber was the architect of obamacare and he said  remember they got him i guess on a cell phone or somehow but they got him he said the lack of transparency was essential to passing the legislation and then he talked about like and i quote the stupidity of the american voter having to do with obamacare  their stupidity an exact quote the stupidity of the american voter now this is what we get this is the hateful attitude of insiders like mr gruber and hillary clinton and the voters have had enough of this  on november th were taking back our country november th  another major reform is going to be school choice and by the way were getting rid of common core were bringing it local  bringing it local  totally getting rid of common core common core is a disaster all you have to do is look at the ranking of schools and see that we pay the most per pupil not even close and were down on the bottom of the list so cant do that gonna be a lot of changes really good changes ive outlined a plan to provide every disadvantaged child in america the freedom to choose the public private magnet religious school of his or her choice  this will help lift millions of poor africanamerican and hispanic children out of poverty the poverty is beyond belief you dont think of it with this country the poverty is beyond belief its time to break up the failed democratic control over our inner cities and provide real hope and opportunity to every single community in this nation we have to bring everybody with us everybody  our policies on taxes trade regulations and education will grow incomes boost jobs and reduce poverty for africanamerican and hispanic communities we have to do it we have to being these communities into a great system and we have to bring these communities back we have to do it  we need a new civil rights agenda for our time one that promises safe neighborhoods great education and a secured job nearly four in  africanamerican children live in poverty including  percent of africanamerican children under that age of   percent fiftyeight percent of africanamerican youth are not working violent crime rose in americas  largest cities last year homicides are up  percent in dc and more than  percent in baltimore and everywhere else  over  people have been shot in chicago since january st of this year  people theres a shooting on average every two hours to those suffering and hurting i say what do you have to lose ill fix it vote for donald trump i mean that what do you have to lose  it cant get any worse and i say this to  i say this to the africanamerican community it cant get any worse it cant get any worse forty percent poverty  percent cant get jobs youth it cant get any worse ill fix it remember that and hillary just wants your vote and then shell say see you in four years ok byebye and you see whats happened with our inner cities where you cant walk down the street without being shot and you see the crime and all of the problems what do you have to lose i will fix it believe me  ill bring back millions of jobs higher wages and great schools i will make your communities safe safety also means protecting our people from radical islamic terrorism all right  i hate even saying this but this just happened new video has just been released showing isis  absolute butchers  murdering innocent people in what has been called a syrian slaughterhouse the victims were dragged then hung from meat hooks and then their throats were slit so we have no question weve got to name the problem which hillary and as you know president obama they wont do weve got to name the problem and weve got to solve the problem weve got to solve the problem this is an evil sadistic monstrous enemy and we must keep these killers out of our country  we know for a fact that isis is trying to infiltrate refugee flows  no question about this  and to recruit refugees after their entry into our country my opponent wants a  percent increase in syrian refugees over and above  then youve got to vote for trump its very simple very simple  thats a  percent increase over and above the obama administration thousands and thousands  percent higher we have no idea who these people are where they come from we have no idea we have no idea what were getting into we have no idea according to the senate subcommittee on immigration her entire plan will bring in  refugees in a first term and cost  billion in lifetime benefits  instead of providing free health care and jobs to refugees from around the world we should rebuild our inner cities and help struggling americans get jobs all over our country  and we all have a heart we all have a heart and so i support totally construction of safe zones in the region but we dont want to pay we owe  trillion   trillion nobody even knows what it means   trillion so what were going to do is were going to get  exactly  were going to get the gulf states to pay for it well lead it well get them to pay for it theyve got plenty of money they just have nobody to ask them youve got to put up the money maybe tell them is a better statement at the same time as we rebuild our military we are going to get our allies to pay their fair share  only five of the  member nato countries meet their obligations to spend two percent of gdp on defense i will convene a summit of our european and asian allies to make sure everyone is sharing in the burden of security we are paying tremendous amounts of money to secure other nations to protect and defend other nations we are going to be made whole we have no choice this isnt  years ago this isnt  years ago and i believe properly asked well be in a very good position and they will be very nice about it  got to be properly asked  and were going to then focus and we have to focus on radical islamic terrorism were going to be focused in all things its time to put americans first we are doing that  and we have to start taking care of each other which were not doing tonight im going to roll out a plan to help our mothers and our families get affordable quality childcare for their children and my daughter ivanka is going to be involved shes the one   she is the one that has been pushing for it so daddy daddy we have to do this and its true shes very smart and shes right on policy after policy were going to provide opportunity prosperity and security for all americans which we dont have now at all im going to lower your taxes im going to get rid of massive amounts of unnecessary regulations on business and in your life were going to as i said repeal and replace obamacare  im going to appoint justices of the united states supreme court who will follow the constitution  im going to rebuild our very depleted military and take care of our great vets for the first time  im going to save your second amendment which is under siege  and as you know the nra endorsed me very early earlier than anybody else and im very honored by that endorsement but the nra you know what theyre doing with our second amendment theyre fighting to save it its a very tough fight another reason we need help and we have to have the help from the united states supreme court  and if the wrong justices get appointed starting with the great justice scalia who unexpectedly passed away so now we have a tie court if somebody takes his place i think you can wave your second amendment as you know it you can wave it goodbye you can wave it goodbye so all of you that are big second amendment proponents and believers you better get out there and you better vote or youre not gonna have much of a second amendment  november th im going to stop illegal immigration and im going to stop drugs from pouring into our country and yes we will build a wall and youre right mexico will pay for the wall they will pay for the wall  we will build a wall folks we gotta stop the drugs from pouring in weve gotta build the wall the endorsement of all of the border patrol agents first time theyve ever done that theyre endorsing a presidential candidate they said mr trump the wall is so necessary its a tool for them another tool but one of the most important ones but they said to me the wall is so important and when i look at the drugs that pour in pour in theyre poisoning our youth you look at new hampshire you look at pennsylvania you look at ohio you look at all the states one of the biggest things and in some cases their single biggest problem is the drug inflow  heroin were gonna stop the drugs from poisoning our youth and plenty of other people we will build a wall    and im going to  so importantly  renegotiate your horrible trade deals especially nafta which is maybe the single worst trade deal ever made by any country anywhere in the world its just a oneway street right now its a oneway street for jobs being ripped out of our country leaving the united states going to mexico and other  its a oneway street were gonna have a nice doublelane highway but much of the stuff is gonna be coming in the opposite direction at least for a long while until we can get ourselves even    but remember this bill clinton signed nafta so bill clinton signed the worst trade deal in the history of the world folks i mean its not like  its in the history of the world theres never been a worse or a dumber deal for trade including tpp which is a disaster  but tpp i dont believe will be as bad as nafta and as you know hillary clinton totally wants to approve tpp she said its the gold standard then she heard of speech of mine and she said wow i better say im gonna reject it but we all know that if she wants she would sign tpp  as you know that you know it  shell sign the tpp and if she signs it it will be catastrophic for not only iowa for our country so we cant let that happen we cant let that happen  we  in negotiating deals  are going to do something very very simple were going to put america  but were going to put the american worker first very simple its very simple its a very simple thing  we dont think in terms of this country  its almost like i was thinking about it over the last couple of weeks in particular its almost like they want these other countries to do so well im saying we are  because nobody can make deals that badly  but when you think about it the reason they are bad is because of the donors the special interests in many cases they own these countries that are leaving the country and ripping us and were gonna stop it and its so easy to stop the globalists its so easy to stop and were going to stop it and ill tell you another thing apple and our other major companies will start making their iphones their computers and other products in the united states not in china and not all over the world  because we dont make things here like we

74,"Trump","thank you very much and  and leadership on this issue   so very much  deeply invested in this long before the campaign began i can tell you that im very grateful to her for her work and efforts and this proposal which we are going to outlining right way and it going to make a lot of people very very happy a lot of moms very very happy  i want to also take a moment to recognize congresswoman cathy mcmorris rodgers the chairwoman of the house republican conference   and a  whos been such a leader and worked so hard with us so cathy we want to thank you very much  were joined  by some amazing members of congress in our audience congresswoman blackburn  blackburn marsha   come on up here  you worked so hard come on    thank you very much and mary jo ann  can you please stand up  the  always done a good job so our campaign is about ideas were about solutions to dayto day problems problems that  ive traveled all over the country in recent weeks offering detailed plans to make life better for you and for your families so important to me ive outlined detailed proposals of providing school choice  involving our tax and regulatory vote    on american energy rebuilding our military changing our foreign policy fixing our immigration so important   and keeping our country safe   thank you right now the politicians have locked our country into endless fights about small and petty things im here to see the nation  and to imagine what we can accomplish if we work together trust each other and put the needs of our citizens first for a change  we must break our ties with the failed and bitter politics and policies of the past and pursue a future where every american is honored and i mean really honored and respected  the average  americans in washington dc that looks down on everyday hardworking people and thats whats happening  too often those who have power have disdain for the views beliefs and attitudes of those who dont have any political power those people must put themselves in the shoes of the radio factory worker the family worried about security or the mom struggling to afford child care  child care is such a big problem  were going to solve that problem that means we need working mothers to be fairly compensated for their work and have access to affordable quality child care for their kids  we want higher pay better wages and a growing economy for everyone these solutions must update laws passed more than a half a century ago when most women were still not in the labor force or some of them werent even close today nearly two in three mothers with young children have jobs for many families in our country child care is now the single largest expense who would think that even more so than housing while critical meaningful policy work has been done in this area my opponent has no child care plan she never will theyll never evolve into a plan theyll never get done anyway   many americans are just one crisis away from a disaster a sick kid a lost job a damaged home there is no financial security in our country especially any more but that will change under our profamily profatherhood  its pro family its pro child its pro worker  the people we have to take care of and this is what im going to be outlining tonight  before  before going any further i want everyone watching on tv and there are a lot of people right now to go to donaldjtrumpcom to read the full plan in detail the first part of my child care plan allows for every parent or family in america including adoptive parents and foster parent guardians to deduct their child care expenses from their income taxes  i see the women who i just met in the front row are very happy about that they will finally be able to deduct the average cost of child care for their state from birth through the age of  because of the way the benefit is capped and structured our plan will bring relief to working and middle class families the deduction also applies to elder care capped at  deduction per year  deduction importantly our policy also supports mothers who choose to stay at home and honors and recognizes their incredible contributions to their families and to our society  families with a stayathome parent will be able to fully deduct the average cost of child care from their taxes  wow   wow the congresswomen like the word wow makes your life a lot easier right the lowincome individuals who are no net income tax liability we will offer an expanded earned income tax credit thats eitc in the form of a child care rebate  working parents will get an expanded eitc benefit that equals up to half of their total payroll tax a major relief for lowincome parents lowincome parents have it tougher than anybody this translates to as much as an extra  in eitc benefits for working families yes  our plan will ask every parent in america to open up a dependent care savings account families can contribute up to  a year in these accounts completely tax free  shes very happy about that ivankas very happy about this crucially unlike the flexible spending accounts that exist today these accounts will be available to all americans you wont have to depend on your employer to provide them and we give family employers  and this is like right way  that also contribute to a dependent account each of which is designed and designated for a specific child including an unborn child the money that is put into these accounts can also be spent not only in child care but also childenriching activities see  theyre starting to act up after hearing it the first time  thats cute additionally the funds in these accounts do not expire at the end of the year they dont revert to employers or to the treasury instead the funds rollover so that while only  can be contributed each year unspent sums can accumulate and create substantial savings tremendous savings  these savings can be used by parents to help give their kids school choice and will thus contribute to the school choice reforms i outlined last week a lot of good outlines last week on schools i grew really popular let me tell you the funds will remain in the account until the age of  whatever still remains at that time can be used to help offset the costs of higher education for your child  for lowincome people the federal government will provide matching funds if parents contribute  the federal government will provide a  match to help lowincome families reach  and save money we will put a box on federal income tax forms allowing these parents to have their earned income tax credit funds directly deposited into their dependent care savings accounts pretty simple these dependent care savings accounts can also be set up to provide care for elderly dependents  our plan also includes much needed regulatory reform to incentivize private sector solutions the reforms offered by our plan will create a new market for our  child care solutions but to make sure these solutions are available  especially to low income and rural communities  we must reduce regulations that favor large institutional care facilities you know what im talking about   special interests  we will allow the states to make decisions that are right for them in this era of sharing economy we want parents to be able to access lowcost competitive and innovative solutions at the click of a button including services like nanny sharing our plan will also cover care provided by relatives and grandparents our plan includes incentives for more employers to offer on site child care as well we want the employers to get involved now then start getting involved bigly right  you will start liking your employer a lot more  this would also be a good solution for many working parents and can save them up to  minutes in commute time thats a lot currently only seven percent of employers provide this service not very much our plan will expand tax deductions for employers allowing companies to pool resources and provided shared care this is i think so important provide shared child care services and remove needless requirements that have prevented employers from using the credit the requirements are so onerous that they never get to use it even though in many cases they would like to finally our plan offers a crucial safety net for working mothers whose employers do not provide paid maternity leave this solution will receive strong bipartisan support do you agree with that do you think when you go to the other side theyll be ok  look at  and well be completely self funding    taxfree  fraud and improper payments in the unemployment insurance program we can provide six weeks of paid maternity leave to any mother with a newborn child whose employer does not provide the benefit  this maternity leave will be paid straight out of the unemployment insurance fund and again the safety net will be completely paid for through savings within the program we have more reforms and solutions in our child care plan and you can review them all on the website on thursday i will outline my family economic plan which is completely paid for through economic growth and proposed federal budget savings its going to be something special like this country hasnt seen in many many decades  together our tax trade regulatory and energy policies will add trillions and trillions of dollars in new deficitgrowing growth these are the kinds of solutions i want to bring to the white house as your president its time to free ourselves from the baskets that politicians try to put us into and hold    and instead we can work together    thank you very much thank you and   while my opponent slanders you as deplorable and irredeemable i call you hardworking american patriots who      thank you its time to end the rule of special interests and to begin the rule of the american people thats what its all about  its time to stop fighting over the smallest words and to start dreaming about the great adventures that lie ahead for our incredible country  its time to start believing in america again  together i promise you together we will make our country strong again we will make our country prosperous again we will make our country great again greater than ever before"
75,"Trump","with great people thank you very much thank you  we are making very big progress i can tell you that and in iowa virtually every poll has us ahead and we are going to win iowa  so i just

important together were gonna win iowa in november  to be specific november th we have to be specific and were going to win the white house and we are going to make america great again ok were going to make america great again  the white house will become the peoples house that will happen we will tackle and fix the problems that have gone unsolved for years and believe me there are many of them  were going to fix our crumbling infrastructure renegotiate our horrible trade deals they are disastrous free children from failing government schools eliminate government waste and create a fair simple and efficient tax code to add millions and millions or new jobs which we need  prosperity will rise poverty will recede and wages will finally begin to grow and they will grow rapidly if they dont ill be very disappointed in myself i will tell you this is a campaign about big ideas designed to help everyday people in recent days weve rolled out one new policy idea after another on taxes on school choice  so important  on foreign policy on defeating terrorisms on rebuilding our military on veterans care and unleashing american energy    oh were having a good time were having a good time go ahead go ahead theres always one    thank you men   all right you can get them thank you   thank you thank you very much thats great thats all right single person theyll end up with more publicity than all of you put together  so were going to unleash american energy were going to put those jobs back like you have not seen in your lifetimes you have not seen before by contrast hillary clinton is running a policyfree campaign she offers no ideas no solutions and only hatred and derision its true you saw that im running to be a president for all americans democrat republican independent everyone whether you vote for me  right  whether you vote for me or whether you vote for someone else i will be still your greatest champion right  our support comes from every part of american and from every walk of life we have the support of cops and soldiers and carpenters and welders and accountants and lawyers the young and the old and millions of working class families all over this nation we cover everybody this is a movement like nobodys ever seen before it really is its a movement  theyre considering it a great phenomena i consider it a great phenomena if we win on november th thats what i consider  well my opponent slanders you as deplorable and irredeemable i call you hardworking american patriots who love your country and want a better future for all of our people  her comments displayed the same sense of arrogance and entitlement that led her to violate federal law as secretary of state hide and delete her emails i mean think  emails and thats just one batch its a lot of wedding talk its a lot of wedding talk  put classified information in the reach of our enemies lied to congress and sell government favors and access through the clinton foundation its this attitude of arrogance that explains why hillary clinton made  phones disappear including with a hammer  so the fbi couldnt see them and why she bleached her emails after a congressional subpoena  thats after the subpoena came this isnt before thats after the subpoena came now the people who destroyed the emails are all pleading the fifth amendment in front of congress today how you seen have you seen whats going on in front of congress fifth amendment fifth amendment fifth amendment horrible horrible and will anything happen thats going to be the question were going to find out anyone watching todays hearing in congress knows that hillary clintons actions are far more corrupt that we ever imagined its happened today this is far bigger and a far bigger scandal than watergate ever was but with watergate we had justice we had a justice department that went after the people heres something that just  nobodys ever seen anything like this folks what were witnessing is a first weve never ever seen anything like this this is a scandal that threatens national security and that involves a multimilliondollar pay for play scheme between the secretary of state and her foundation  whether its her emails her disasters in iraq libya and syria or her failures on the economy of which its been disastrous hillary clinton lacks the judgment temperament and moral character to lead this country she does you know it everybody knows it  everybody knows it  everybody knows it in the words of a secret service agent posted outside her office she simply lacks the integrity and the temperament to serve in the office from the bottom of my soul he said i know this to be true the policies of hillary clinton have produced death destruction overseas its been disastrous no matter where you look everything shes touched has been a disaster and produced only failing schools rising crime job loss shrinking incomes and tragic poverty at home you want four more years of it   i had a feeling you might say that  its so sad to see whats going on in our country is so sad one in five american households do not have a single member in the labor force another  million people have left the labor force since  and the national debt has doubled to nearly  trillion during the obama years  im running to reverse these policies and to create a future of prosperity for all americans  all americans  that includes youll be happy to hear this our family farms right here in iowa  family farms  the farmers are being left out in the cold family farms are the backbone of this country we are going to end the epa intrusion into your family homes and your family farms  we are going to protect the renewable fuel standard cornbased ethanol eliminate jobkilling regulations like the waters of the us rule and provide desperately needed tax relief  our plan lowers the tax rate on family farms down to  percent from  percent and you watch your farms grow you watch businesses all over the country grow you watch jobs come back it will be a beautiful thing and remember this the double taxation of family farms at death you want to leave your farms to your children its a disaster because it doesnt happen so helping to ensure that the family farm we have to make and we have to continue the tradition in iowa we want it to continue to thrive with your family  and youll be looking down your family and youll be proud ok so were going to take care of that my economic agenda can be summed up in three words jobs jobs jobs  that means were going to negotiate trade deals to protect our farmers help them export their goods and make money doing it because the way it is now its impossible and grow family farming in america were going to grow the farms  my first day in office im also going to order a review of every single regulation issued over the last  years  all needless jobkilling regulations will be canceled  millions and millions of new jobs will come pouring into our country were going to lift the restrictions on american energy which means lower electricity prices for our farmers and a half a million jobs a year at least probably a number much higher than that and that will just be the beginning also on my first day im going to ask congress to send me a bill to immediately repeal and replace disastrous obamacare  this will instantly save another  million jobs at least probably more than that by the way remember jonathan gruber anybody remember that name  people forgot a long time ago but some people remember i see that jonathan gruber was the architect of obamacare and he said  remember they got him i guess on a cell phone or somehow but they got him he said the lack of transparency was essential to passing the legislation and then he talked about like and i quote the stupidity of the american voter having to do with obamacare  their stupidity an exact quote the stupidity of the american voter now this is what we get this is the hateful attitude of insiders like mr gruber and hillary clinton and the voters have had enough of this  on november th were taking back our country november th  another major reform is going to be school choice and by the way were getting rid of common core were bringing it local  bringing it local  totally getting rid of common core common core is a disaster all you have to do is look at the ranking of schools and see that we pay the most per pupil not even close and were down on the bottom of the list so cant do that gonna be a lot of changes really good changes ive outlined a plan to provide every disadvantaged child in america the freedom to choose the public private magnet religious school of his or her choice  this will help lift millions of poor africanamerican and hispanic children out of poverty the poverty is beyond belief you dont think of it with this country the poverty is beyond belief its time to break up the failed democratic control over our inner cities and provide real hope and opportunity to every single community in this nation we have to bring everybody with us everybody  our policies on taxes trade regulations and education will grow incomes boost jobs and reduce poverty for africanamerican and hispanic communities we have to do it we have to being these communities into a great system and we have to bring these communities back we have to do it  we need a new civil rights agenda for our time one that promises safe neighborhoods great education and a secured job nearly four in  africanamerican children live in poverty including  percent of africanamerican children under that age of   percent fiftyeight percent of africanamerican youth are not working violent crime rose in americas  largest cities last year homicides are up  percent in dc and more than  percent in baltimore and everywhere else  over  people have been shot in chicago since january st of this year  people theres a shooting on average every two hours to those suffering and hurting i say what do you have to lose ill fix it vote for donald trump i mean that what do you have to lose  it cant get any worse and i say this to  i say this to the africanamerican community it cant get any worse it cant get any worse forty percent poverty  percent cant get jobs youth it cant get any worse ill fix it remember that and hillary just wants your vote and then shell say see you in four years ok byebye and you see whats happened with our inner cities where you cant walk down the street without being shot and you see the crime and all of the problems what do you have to lose i will fix it believe me  ill bring back millions of jobs higher wages and great schools i will make your communities safe safety also means protecting our people from radical islamic terrorism all right  i hate even saying this but this just happened new video has just been released showing isis  absolute butchers  murdering innocent people in what has been called a syrian slaughterhouse the victims were dragged then hung from meat hooks and then their throats were slit so we have no question weve got to name the problem which hillary and as you know president obama they wont do weve got to name the problem and weve got to solve the problem weve got to solve the problem this is an evil sadistic monstrous enemy and we must keep these killers out of our country  we know for a fact that isis is trying to infiltrate refugee flows  no question about this  and to recruit refugees after their entry into our country my opponent wants a  percent increase in syrian refugees over and above  then youve got to vote for trump its very simple very simple  thats a  percent increase over and above the obama administration thousands and thousands  percent higher we have no idea who these people are where they come from we have no idea we have no idea what were getting into we have no idea according to the senate subcommittee on immigration her entire plan will bring in  refugees in a first term and cost  billion in lifetime benefits  instead of providing free health care and jobs to refugees from around the world we should rebuild our inner cities and help struggling americans get jobs all over our country  and we all have a heart we all have a heart and so i support totally construction of safe zones in the region but we dont want to pay we owe  trillion   trillion nobody even knows what it means   trillion so what were going to do is were going to get  exactly  were going to get the gulf states to pay for it well lead it well get them to pay for it theyve got plenty of money they just have nobody to ask them youve got to put up the money maybe tell them is a better statement at the same time as we rebuild our military we are going to get our allies to pay their fair share  only five of the  member nato countries meet their obligations to spend two percent of gdp on defense i will convene a summit of our european and asian allies to make sure everyone is sharing in the burden of security we are paying tremendous amounts of money to secure other nations to protect and defend other nations we are going to be made whole we have no choice this isnt  years ago this isnt  years ago and i believe properly asked well be in a very good position and they will be very nice about it  got to be properly asked  and were going to then focus and we have to focus on radical islamic terrorism were going to be focused in all things its time to put americans first we are doing that  and we have to start taking care of each other which were not doing tonight im going to roll out a plan to help our mothers and our families get affordable quality childcare for their children and my daughter ivanka is going to be involved shes the one   she is the one that has been pushing for it so daddy daddy we have to do this and its true shes very smart and shes right on policy after policy were going to provide opportunity prosperity and security for all americans which we dont have now at all im going to lower your taxes im going to get rid of massive amounts of unnecessary regulations on business and in your life were going to as i said repeal and replace obamacare  im going to appoint justices of the united states supreme court who will follow the constitution  im going to rebuild our very depleted military and take care of our great vets for the first time  im going to save your second amendment which is under siege  and as you know the nra endorsed me very early earlier than anybody else and im very honored by that endorsement but the nra you know what theyre doing with our second amendment theyre fighting to save it its a very tough fight another reason we need help and we have to have the help from the united states supreme court  and if the wrong justices get appointed starting with the great justice scalia who unexpectedly passed away so now we have a tie court if somebody takes his place i think you can wave your second amendment as you know it you can wave it goodbye you can wave it goodbye so all of you that are big second amendment proponents and believers you better get out there and you better vote or youre not gonna have much of a second amendment  november th im going to stop illegal immigration and im going to stop drugs from pouring into our country and yes we will build a wall and youre right mexico will pay for the wall they will pay for the wall  we will build a wall folks we gotta stop the drugs from pouring in weve gotta build the wall the endorsement of all of the border patrol agents first time theyve ever done that theyre endorsing a presidential candidate they said mr trump the wall is so necessary its a tool for them another tool but one of the most important ones but they said to me the wall is so important and when i look at the drugs that pour in pour in theyre poisoning our youth you look at new hampshire you look at pennsylvania you look at ohio you look at all the states one of the biggest things and in some cases their single biggest problem is the drug inflow  heroin were gonna stop the drugs from poisoning our youth and plenty of other people we will build a wall    and im going to  so importantly  renegotiate your horrible trade deals especially nafta which is maybe the single worst trade deal ever made by any country anywhere in the world its just a oneway street right now its a oneway street for jobs being ripped out of our country leaving the united states going to mexico and other  its a oneway street were gonna have a nice doublelane highway but much of the stuff is gonna be coming in the opposite direction at least for a long while until we can get ourselves even    but remember this bill clinton signed nafta so bill clinton signed the worst trade deal in the history of the world folks i mean its not like  its in the history of the world theres never been a worse or a dumber deal for trade including tpp which is a disaster  but tpp i dont believe will be as bad as nafta and as you know hillary clinton totally wants to approve tpp she said its the gold standard then she heard of speech of mine and she said wow i better say im gonna reject it but we all know that if she wants she would sign tpp  as you know that you know it  shell sign the tpp and if she signs it it will be catastrophic for not only iowa for our country so we cant let that happen we cant let that happen  we  in negotiating deals  are going to do something very very simple were going to put america  but were going to put the american worker first very simple its very simple its a very simple thing  we dont think in terms of this country  its almost like i was thinking about it over the last couple of weeks in particular its almost like they want these other countries to do so well im saying we are  because nobody can make deals that badly  but when you think about it the reason they are bad is because of the donors the special interests in many cases they own these countries that are leaving the country and ripping us and were gonna stop it and its so easy to stop the globalists its so easy to stop and were going to stop it and ill tell you another thing apple and our other major companies will start making their iphones their computers and other products in the united states not in china and not all over the world  because we dont make things here like we used to anymore were going to start making things in our country were going to start having the jobs be jobs that are good for our country  were going to rebuild our roads our bridges our tunnels our highways our airports our schools and our hospitals american cars will travel the roads american airplanes will soar the skies and american ships will patrol the seas we dont make ships american steel will send new skyscrapers into the clouds and american hands will rebuild this nation and american energy mined from american sources will power our great nation  american workers will be hired to do the job we will put new american metal into the spine of this country american metal and american steel i will fight for every neglected part of the nation and i will fight to bring us all together as one american people which were not we are so badly divided imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as one people under one god saluting one american flag one american flag   its time to break with the bitter failures of the past and to embrace a new inclusive and prosperous  and i mean truly prosperous  american future we could be better than we ever were we can we can better we can be greater than we ever were i know the people ive traveled ive seen thousand ive seen millions of people incredible people we can be greater than ever before jobs will return incomes will rise and new factories will come rushing back to our shores  once more we will have a government of by and for the people  we will make american prosperous again we will make america safe again we will make america great again  thank you god bless you everybody thank you very much thank you november th thank you everybody"

generals and admirals  i didnt know we had that many well we love them we also have the support of  border patrol officers  the first time in the history of the border patrol that theyve endorsed any presidential candidate as well as law enforcement officers police all across the country  in fact im very excited to announce tonight that we just received a few minutes ago an endorsement of the largest police union in the country the fraternal order of police number one by far  pretty good pretty good and we have the support of millions of patriotic moms and dads who go to work every day and make our country run while my opponent slanders you as deplorable and irredeemable  boy that second word is tough you dont hear that as much but that means youre never going to come back folks and i know youre going to come back were going to come back so strong were going to be so strong stronger than ever before irredeemable they dont talk about that one but that was to me pretty bad i call you hardworking american patriots who love your family and really really really love your country love your country    clintons entire campaign rests on using a single tactic and its not working very well she spent hundreds of millions of dollars on phony campaign ads and were actually i think probably leading based on everything were seeing and weve spent practically nothing im proud of that  and you know what  were doing very well you know in the old days if you spent less and you had far fewer people and you were leading you got credit today they say well shes spending much more money yes but shes doing poorly very poorly but what they do is they smear opponents and you look at her history and they question policies and they talk all the time about racist racist its the only word they know they used it on romney they used it on everybody they use it when theyre in trouble they always pull out the racist word and they are in very big trouble i have to tell you  and for the most part we havent even started spending our money yet and we have raised a lot of money and im putting in my money and i put in a hell of a lot of money in fact   if things dont work out even though a lot of people are saying this was one of the great political phenomenas theyve ever seen theyve never seen  they call it a phenomena i will tell you if it doesnt work out it will be a tremendous waste of time energy and money and shes angry for even suggesting it  but were going to  hey look november  you go and vote were winning ill tell you what if you vote were winning  theres no way they can beat us  theres no way she can beat us because her people have no enthusiasm whatsoever theyre not going to turn out they dont have the enthusiasm who could possibly have enthusiasm what are you getting you turn out winning big league and i think  and theyre all saying the trump people are going to turn out we have a movement like they have never ever seen in this country  and they say in terms of enthusiasm they have never had polling higher so i think i have very little doubt turnout were going to have a tremendous november  probably well say november  plus the next four years and then four years after that ok  but the racist word its the oldest play in the democratic playbook and americans have had enough of it ok we get it we get it ill tell you what i just  i told you i just left little haiti the love is unbelievable its unbelievable  theres no racist theres no nothing its love they want solutions they want better lives not more petty attacks from failed and totally discredited politicians like crooked hillary clinton  they want their immigration laws enforced and their border secured   lets win on november  ok thatll be  theyre patriotic americans of all background who want their jobs and their families protected they want protection people who warn about radical islamic terrorism are not islamophobes everyones an islamophobe you mention something youre an islamophobe you know they come up with words hey i went to ivy league school i did very well they have so many new words islamophobe we have a president and frankly hillary who dont use the words radical islamic terrorism and if you dont know what youre fighting youre not going to fight it very well and weve proven that we have decent american citizens who want to uphold our tolerant values and keep our country safe we want to keep our country safe people who support the police who want crime reduced and ended and who are not prejudiced theyre concerned and loving citizens whose hearts break every time an innocent child is killed violently on the streets which is happening all over our country yet while hillary clinton lives behind gates and walls and guards and raises millions from  you know look what shes doing with these hedge funds raising millions and millions i know so many of these people give me a break the hedge fund and the wall street donors she slanders and smears with her statements last week working people who just want a fraction of the security enjoyed by our politicians and certainly enjoyed by her now you know shes very much against the second amendment she wants to destroy your second amendment  guns guns guns right i think what we should do is she goes around with armed bodyguards like you have never seen before i think that her bodyguards should drop all weapons they should disarm right  right i think they should disarm immediately what do you think yes yes  take their guns away she doesnt want guns take their  lets see what happens to her take their guns away ok itll be very dangerous her comments displayed the same sense of arrogance and entitlement that led her to violate federal law as secretary of state hide and delete her emails destroy her iphones with a hammer with a hammer thirteen of them  put classified information in the reach of our enemies lie to congress and sell government favors and access through her foundation its the same attitude of arrogance and entitlement that explains why she has never taken accountability for the disaster she created in libya syria iraq iran and all over the world everything she touched it just didnt work out certainly it didnt work out for our country its the same reason why she wont take responsibility for her central role in unleashing isis all over the world  her policies have created disaster overseas and poverty at home we see it look we see it i drove here we see it we see it im running to reverse these failures and they are incredible failures and create a new american future  and that future begins with prosperity at home  my economic agenda can be summed up in three words and youre going to like these three words jobs jobs jobs  one of my highest priorities is to bring jobs into our inner cities africanamerican communities have suffered horribly as a result of failed democratic leadership democrats have run these inner cities for a half a century for  years  years even in some cases  years straight unabated unbroken over  years they control the mayors offices the school boards the city councils and the seats in congress and all they have delivered is more poverty more crime and more failing schools sixtyfive percent of africanamerican children under the age of six now live in poverty more than  people have been shot in the city of chicago this year this year think of it since jan  fiftyeight percent of africanamerican youth are not working cant get a job these are the results of the policies embraced by hillary clinton and everyone knows that if shes elected the inner cities will get nothing but more pain and suffering and crime and heartache     amazing people amazing country we have an amazing country and honestly you see the crime statistics your african american you have the inner city problems that have been going on forever forever you have problems like nobody has and you look at crime you look at schools you look at no jobs look at the worse education look how dangerous you cant walk down the street you get shot or your child gets shot and ive been saying it and ill say it openly and some people like it and some people dont like it and i dont really care  what do you have to lose i will fix it im going to fix it were going to fix our inner cities were going to make them safe were going to bring jobs back so to the africanamerican people within the community what do you have to lose it cant get  honestly it cant get  thats so nice thank you it cant get any worse it cant get any worse it cant get any worse   thank you   so nice thank you thank you very much it cant get any worse the crime the jobs no jobs no education worse education more unsafe  you go to afghanistan right we hear afghanistan i mean we have cities that are far more dangerous than afghanistan inner cities africanamerican people within that community and outside of that community are going to be voting for donald trump in record numbers  you watch  were going to fix it hillary clinton has been in washington for  years her disastrous record speaks for itself and i have to tell you when she ran for the united states senate in new york we have upstate new york which is a total disaster economic disaster she said shes going to bring back jobs jobs jobs she  anyway she gets elected we lost our jobs it got worse she didnt do anything she didnt do anything she went home she went to sleep ok she didnt do anything she didnt do anything it got worse far worse now its a total catastrophe just remember that when she tells you about jobs when she tells you shes going to fix trade deals she wouldnt know where to begin she wouldnt know where to begin and besides that to do that kind of thing to negotiate great trade deals to reenhance our  i mean look our military is so depleted we have the greatest people on earth theyre using equipment thats old theyre flying planes that are old you see whats happening its a depleted military we have to have a strong military we have to take care of our vets  we have to take care of our vets  but to do these things you need a lot of energy and she does not have the energy and in my opinion she is totally unfit to be the president of the united states  the only people that she will deliver for frankly are her donors and her special interests im going to deliver for you believe me the american people were going to deliver youre going to be happy and those inner cities are going to see progress like they have probably not probably like they have never seen you watch like they have never seen  thank you  if we lower our taxes and were getting a massive tax reduction  and by the way hillary clinton is raising your taxes substantially  if we remove destructive regulations unleash the vast treasure of american energy we have so much energy its being destroyed our economic worth and negotiate trade deals that put america first then there is no limit to the number of jobs we can create and the amount of prosperity we can unleash there is no limit pay off our debt pay down our debt reduce taxes get rid of regulations my first day in office im going to order a review of every single regulation issued over the last  years  all needless jobkilling regulations will be immediately canceled millions of new jobs will come pouring in and were going to lift the restrictions on american energy which means at least another half a million jobs each year they are being destroyed  and were unable to compete with other nations very simple and thats just the beginning also on my first day im going to ask congress to send me a bill to immediately repeal and replace disastrous obamacare  it has turned out to be a disaster  this alone will instantly save another two million jobs and if you look at your premiums its through the roof and by the way on november  just before the election on november  new numbers are coming out which will show    percent increases they want to delay it until after the election because its election  its a disaster its a disaster and your deductibles are so high that unless you lead a really long slow vicious death youre never going to be able to use ok do you see the deductibles youre never going to be able to use it im also going to completely reform our trade deals were going to renegotiate nafta  probably the worst trade deal ever agreed to signed in the history of the world not in the united states its destroyed our manufacturing in our country its destroyed and by the way guess who signed it bill clinton  you look at all of the places florida included but you look at upstate new york you look at ohio you look at pennsylvania you look at all of these different places have been destroyed absolutely destroyed you look at new england look what happened to new england theyve been destroyed by companies moving out going into mexico firing everybody unemployment through the roof were going to stand up to china and keep america out of the transpacific partnership another catastrophe  tpp will be almost as bad as nafta nothing can be as bad as nafta transpacific partnership will be almost as bad as nafta itll take your jobs ohio remember its going to take your jobs ohio i tell you that michigan so many places tpp is a disaster we dont need another massive multinational deal by the way that nobody on our side even reads that ties us up and binds us down and doesnt even discuss monetary manipulation and devaluation which is how china and all these countries are beating us so badly not even discussed and they had provisions in the agreement and they would take it out because certain politicians didnt want to have them in there i wonder why another major reform is going to be school choice  and were going to terminate common core and were bringing our education local  ive outlined a plan to provide every disadvantaged child in america the freedom to choose the private public magnet or religious school of his or her choice  this will help lift millions of poor africanamerican and hispanic children out of poverty something we are going to do since president obama came into office another two million hispanicamericans have fallen into poverty its catastrophic and its totally unacceptable to the hispanic community i say we are going to protect your jobs were going to build up your schools and were going to deliver safety and opportunity for your children you have no safety you have little opportunity  this week i also rolled out a plan to help our mothers and our families get affordable quality child care for their children ivanka trump very much for child care shes been talking about that to me for two years long before i even decided to go through this journey and its not easy i want to tell you we speak in rooms like this this is about  degrees right now thats considered a cool auditorium and the reason is we have such big crowds like this one look at that every single corner  unbelievable  these rooms werent designed for this many people and it is hot in these rooms and we stand up here and we talk and we do two or three and sometimes well be hitting four a day do you think hillary clinton can get through one   you ever see her minute speech bomb bomb bomb see ya see ya im going home no were doing it the right way and frankly when they spend hundreds of millions of dollars on advertising i dont have to because i do it the old fashioned way i come into your neighborhood right  its a lot cheaper its a lot harder work but its a lot cheaper  very true very very true on policy after policy were going to provide opportunity prosperity and security for all americans were also going to stand with the cuban people in their fight against communist oppression  no were on the right side great people theyre great people the presidents onesided deal for cuba and with cuba benefits only the castro regime  people are very unhappy about it you know whats interesting when he landed the plane recently in china right they refused to give him a stairway out of air force one now that is a first in the history of air force one so he used basically the mechanics stairs thats the stairs they drop down to get the mechanics up to fix the light bulb right  when he landed the plane in saudi arabia which we protect without us they wouldnt be there for two months he landed in saudi arabia he wasnt greeted by the top officials now what would i have done in those two cases bomb take me back to washington jim lets go  right lets go  lets go jim get going close those doors were going home  now with cuba with cuba we land in cuba and theres no castro to greet him the big leaders werent there to greet him and i have a lot of cuban friends but you would have all done the same thing again jim lets close those doors were going home right  right  lets go captain were going home were going into washington maybe well head into miami actually thats not a bad idea  terrible thats three three saudi arabia cuba china air force one has never been treated so badly in its long and incredible history air force one used to land and people would respect the people inside and theyd come out and thered be all sorts of hoopla not anymore its unbelievable and these are countries that are benefited by us greatly so we have to make great deals before we do anything with cuba or anybody else right were going to make great deals youll be happy youre going to be happy i tell you how many people are from cuba here come here tell me  cuban cuban good do you agree with me do you agree  well do it but well do it with great deals and well do it with democracy and well do it the way we have to do it ok well do it the right way where is ms delgado does everybody know what a great  where is she she is so amazing aj where is aj wow shes so  shes become a tremendous star tell you one thing when shes representing me i wouldnt do it anyway but i can turn off the television im well protected thank you great job thank you very much  thank you aj  but all of the concessions that barack obama has granted the castro regime were done through executive order which means the next president can reverse them and that i will do unless the castro regime meets our demands not my demands our demands you know what the demands are  those demands will include religious and political freedom for the cuban people  and the freeing of political prisoners the freeing of political prisoners  right am i  is that right  oh boy oh boy what energy in this room what energy  a lot of energy   youll be very happy my cuban friends i have so many friends from cuba incredible people so lets also talk about a place called venezuela  they  now whos here from venezuela or related in some  not too many whoa whoa whats going on not too many friend or foe i think hes friend  i think hes friend  no hes ok hes ok by the way is there any place more fun to be than a trump rally you tell me  right  tell you we have a lot of venezuelans around doral the doral section right and its a beautiful vibrant  this is an amazing place but they are really having trouble over in venezuela but miami is filled with hardworking incredible venezuelan people  but its been hurt very badly by socialist venezuela and the next president of the united states must stand in solidarity with all people oppressed in our atmosphere and we will stand with oppressed people and there are many the oppressed people of venezuela they are yearning to be free they are yearning for help the system is bad but the people are great great  they are great people here in america ill push to expand freedom for all of our citizens im going to lower your taxes so substantially  were getting rid of all of those regulations on business so many small business owners here i know five of them one of them was small business now hes big business im proud of him hes right here but were going to get rid of those terrible terrible regulations he just said to me and the thing that surprised me most were bringing business tax rates down from  percent to  percent and yet   itll be the greatest cut i believe in the history of our country but i will tell you what surprises me tremendously is that the people that have these cuts theyre more concerned with regulation than even a big tax decrease because regulations are choking and killing our businesses and stopping our businesses from hiring people jobs so im going to appoint justices of the supreme court who will follow the constitution  im going to rebuild our depleted  were going to take care of our  the vets whos a vet whos a vet  where are my vets where are they there they  ok now theyre standing up now they  i know we had a lot of vets here thank you fellas thank you very much  were going to take care of our vets were going to save your second amendment do you know if you look at some of the things the catastrophes  you look at orlando you look at san bernardino you look at so many different  you look at paris the toughest gun laws in the world they have it in paris these thugs these animals walked in and they just go bomb bomb bomb nobody had guns on the other side if there were guns on the other side just a few of them number one probably if they knew they wouldnt have attacked and number two even if they did attack it wouldve been a whole different story one hundred thirty people killed people massively injured still in the hospital their lives are just destroyed and if they had protection if they had guns on the other side with the bullets flying the other direction it wouldve been a whole different story so were going to protect your second amendment and im going to stop illegal immigration and drugs from coming into our country  and yes we will build a wall well build a wall  we will build a wall   whos going to pay for the wall   one hundred percent one hundred percent and were going to be renegotiating nafta and our terrible trade deals were going to make great deals out of horrible deals and if we cant renegotiate the deal because the other side is so so happy with it were going to terminate the deal and well start all over again folks well have new deals and theyll be much better deals and theyll be twoway streets the traffic itll be coming our way its a oneway street out of the united states for our jobs and our money you know i always say we get the drugs they get the cash thats the deal folks no good theyre building in mexico right now and mexicos just one example some of the greatest plants a friend of mine builds plants and he tells me all the time i called him up the other day i called him up six months ago told me the same thing nothing changes ford they just announced yesterday theyre moving their small car division the whole thing into mexico  thats on top of spending billions and billions of dollars  and then you wonder why im winning in michigan because ive been telling the people in michigan ive been telling the people in ohio for five years that this is happening and our politicians dont do anything about it and hillary clinton will never do anything about it she doesnt have the capability to do it we will rebuild our roads and bridges tunnels highways airports schools and hospitals american cars will travel the roads american planes will soar in the sky theyll soar  and american ships will patrol the seas american steel will send new skyscrapers right here in miami into the clouds but itll be american steel  american hands will rebuild this nation and american energy mined from american sources will power our energy and well take care of our steel workers and well take care of our miners who have been destroyed by this administration destroyed  and hillary clinton has already said shes going to put the miners out of business were going to take care of our miners theyre amazing people american workers will be hired to do the job we will put new american steel into the spine of our country  i will fight for every neglected part of this nation and i will fight to bring us all together as one people imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as one people under one god saluting one flag    its time to break with the bitter failures of the past and to embrace a new inclusive and prosperous american future were not prosperous anymore we owe  trillion we have a president who in sevenandahalf years has doubled the debt our countrys in trouble a lot of people dont know it but our countrys in trouble and were going to make sure that trouble never comes let me tell you  jobs will return incomes will rise and new factories will come rushing back to our shores once more we will have a government of by and for the people  we will make america wealthy again  we will make america safe again  we will make america strong again  and we will make america great again  thank you everybody thank you thank you miami"
77,"Trump","great people great people  thank you thank you and thank you maria for the introduction it was beautiful and for the work that you and your organization do to honor these stolen american lives and thats what they are stolen american lives and to advocate for justice on behalf of all american victims we thank you and thank you folks what you have to go through is unbelievable  im honored to be here today and to shine a national spotlight on a group of victims who have been forced and i mean truly forced into the shadows your stories are not featured in the news you have no demonstrators taking to the streets on your behalf you have no special interests taking up your cause and the politicians ignore your cries for help but i never will i will never  and ive known many of you for a long time now it seems like a long time but im still here and youre still here right were still fighting ive met many incredible people during the course of this campaign but nothing has moved me more deeply than the time ive spent with the families of the remembrance project  by the way are doing such an incredible job  and the strength and the courage that youve shown in your very often lonely fight for justice will get there you are the heroes you are and your actions will help us to save the next thousand american citizens from losing their brothers and sisters and sons and daughters and parents the most fundamental duty of government is to protect american lives  anyone who fails to understand this is not fit to hold public office  every day our border remains open innocent americans are needlessly victimized and killed every day sanctuary cities are left in place innocent americans are put in harms way every day we fail to enforce our laws in a day and this is absolutely happening all the time is a day when a loving parent is at risk of losing their child and its happening every single day all across this country dining room tables have an empty seat at the family table because our government abandoned its duty and failed to enforce its basic laws there are a lot of numbers in the immigration debate ive been talking about it for a long time and obviously people agree with me because you see whats happening you see the numbers you see the polls you see whats going on at the rallies a lot of people agree with me almost it seems everybody agrees you almost say whats not to agree with  whats not to agree but let me give you the most important number of all that most important number of all is the number of american lives that is acceptable to lose in the name of illegal immigration let me tell you what that number is zero zero  our nation should not accept one lost american life because our country failed to enforce its laws what do you tell the mother who just buried her daughter because someone was released at the border who should have been sent home or should have been imprisoned in another country what do you tell the young boy who will grow up without a dad because a criminal was deported five times but was allowed to keep coming back and coming back and coming back into our country doing tremendous harm what do you tell the wife whos lost her husband because a sanctuary city released an illegal immigrant from behind bars this has to end it will end if i become president i promise you it will end  thank you   thank you everybody thank you   thank you  i love you we love everybody in this room special special people not one more american life should be given up in the name of open borders just look at what happened in the last few days last week it was reported that authorities detained an illegal immigrant in the austin area who was responsible for nearly a dozen sexual assaults and had been previously deported five times within a threeyear period earlier this week in kansas a sheriffs department master deputy was killed apparently by an illegal immigrant the driver was arrested for dui in california in  and for traffic violations in kansas deputy collins was killed only hours after his daughters th birthday a few days ago two correctional officers in california were critically wounded after being shot by an illegal immigrant who overstayed his visa this individual had been convicted of child rape and was slated to be deported but his home country refused to take him back he was simply too bad too tough too evil they said we refuse to take him back one of the victims has six children is an air force veteran and a high school football coach the other victim is a mother and a grandmother when hillary clinton was secretary of state the matter of this country and think of this think of this that matter of this country refusing to take back the deported citizen came before hillary clintons desk oftentimes many times but she failed to take forceful action and ignored the federal law requiring her to suspend visas to countries that dont take back their citizens she didnt want to get involved  a politician politicians according to a report from the boston globe from the year  through  nearly  criminal aliens were released back into us communities because their home countries would not take them back they were too tough they were too angry they were too evil they dont want them back and we dont force them back we want to be nice people and we want to be nice and politically correct and theyre all roaming the streets most of these  releases occurred on hillary clintons watch she had the power and the duty to stop it cold and she didnt now my opponent will never meet with you never meet with you no interest you know that because youve been trying for a long time year theyve been trying for years she will never hear your stories she will never share your pain she will only meet with the donors and the special interests and the openborder advocates her plan calls for total amnesty in the first  days which means obamacare social security and medicare for illegal immigrants her plan falls for catchandrelease on the border sanctuary cities ignoring visa overstays closing detention centers and a virtual end to immigration enforcement in the united states of america hillary clinton has even announced that she plans to go around congress and implement amnesty by executive order violating our constitution and putting the entire nation in grave peril hillary clinton is the person and i mean the first person to ever run for the presidency of a country effectively proposing to abolish the borders around the country that shes supposed to be representing but the media doesnt want you to know that so theyll never ask her any questions about her plan wont be talked about at the debate which is going to be a very interesting period of time  like how shell afford to give lifetime welfare and entitlements to illegal immigrants or how many people will be victimized because of the illegal immigrants that will be released from federal custody right at the border or inside of the border shes not asked to explain what shell say to the american workers who lose their jobs when she prints out millions of work permits for those here totally against the law many of whom have very very substantial problems your  stories are ignored by our political establishment because they are determined to keep our border open at any cost to them your presence is just too inconvenient thats all it is its an inconvenience but help is coming ill tell you that  on november th were going to win the white house  and we are going to deliver justice for every american family and every single american victim you know what that means you know what that means together we will save american lives and prevent the next thousand american parents from suffering the same fate as the people in this room today their loved ones will not have died in vain believe me they will not have died in vain  since  alone think of this since  the obama administration has allowed  criminal aliens to return back into the united states and its communities these are individuals encountered or identified by ice but who were not detained or processed for deportation according to the federal governments own data there were more than  million convicted criminal illegal immigrants inside of the united states right now  million and we wonder why do we we have such crime why do we have such violence and this is true violence this is violence like most people have never even heard of before however this figure does not include the many individuals who have committed crimes but escaped justice fled the jurisdiction or were otherwise never caught and many of the folks are in that position where you even sometimes know who they are and yet theyre never caught were going to catch them were going to catch them  many crimes committed by people here illegally remain open cases and yet our government knows a lot about the people that did it but they dont go after them theyve killed people they dont go after them at the same time hundreds of individuals who have been given visas and refugee  and think of this theyve been given visas their refugee admissions into the country subsequently were charged with terrorism and nobody does anything about it nobody does anything about it its the most unbelievable thing that ive seen thats why ive become  its like become a personal passion for me when i see these people and theres so many people remembrance project there are so many people this is a small group a lot of people its a small group compared to what were talking about the devastation is unbelievable so were admitting people here with no idea of who they are and we dont know very much about them we dont know what they believe we dont know if they have love in their heart for our country or if they have hatred in their heart for our country whether its drugs terrorism or violent crime our government is utterly failing in its core mission to defend and protect the people of this country the border patrol agents these are incredible people they endorsed me the first time theyve ever endorsed a presidential campaign  thank you theyve warned that hillary clintons plan would put the entire country in grave danger i fully understand that they called it radical and deeply dangerous and warned it would trigger an unprecedented national crisis they know they know better than any consultant they know better than anybody the border patrol agents lets just  to prevent the next family from suffering the same terrible fate  that is what is at stake in this election so i am now going to invite some of the bravest people i know and i mean that  percent to come up here and speak lets start maybe from this side weve picked five families and if you could say a few words so how about we start over here come on perfect thank you thank you everybody        thank you very much these are a few of the stories there are thousands of these stories and we have to work very hard and we have to be very smart these are truly wounded families and sadly theyll never be the same i spoke to some of the families we met for an hour backstage and i said does it get better with time and they actually said it doesnt and sometimes it gets worse with time which is something thats incredible so i just want to thank all of the folks great brave people and theyre representing a lot of other people a lot thousands and thousands of people where similar things have happened and i think id like to ask maybe maria to come back up and were going to ask her to say a few words thank you maria    thank you very much   thank you well thank you very much folks and i really appreciate it and to these unbelievably strong and brave people we will fight and we will win and again i say your loved ones will not have died in vain believe me ok thank you everybody thank you very much"

and ill tell you what were going to do a real job for the state of new hampshire and i owe something very special because again this was my first victory and this is where it all started so just remember  look at how many people are here look at what happened recently hillary clinton bernie sanders had very few people at their rally yesterday and thats because they dont like hillary and bernie sold out to the devil you know if bernie  if bernie had made his deal and just done something where maybe he did nothing and just run away he would have been a legendary character he would have been a legendary political figure but the deal he made with hillary was not the right thing and it wasnt representative of what he should have done to his people and were going to have a lot of bernies people supporting us especially because of my views on trade  were going to have a lot of bernie people but he should never have made the deal and ill beg you he waste he didnt make that deal that was not the right deal for him to make the people of new hampshire and everywhere else dont care about bernie anymore because now theyre looking to the future and the future is going to be something special i love the people of new hampshire and were going to fulfill every single wish every single promise were going to do something very very significant for you youre strong youre independent and you are free were going to work very hard together over the next  days can you believe it  days this started june th to new york city and here we are and were going to win the state

everyday americans and theyve rigged it for a long time were going to create millions of new jobs and we really need them we need jobs people have given up looking for jobs were going to create trillions of dollars and new wealth for our communities and rising wages for every worker in america were going to create a new government that serves you and your family and your country were going to end the clinton corruption and restore  i mean did you see what happened yesterday did you see what happened yesterday with the director of the fbi talking about the e mails  i dont think ive ever seen a thing like that its an embarrassment i dont think ive ever seen a thing like that in my life and it really is a sad  it was a sad sad  honestly its a sad time for the united states its a very very sad time and yesterday was a sad a very sad day lets see what happens i think  i actually believe because of what happened yesterday i think that whole thing has a long way to go so were going to see what happens hillary  right i mean is it incredible hillary clinton is an insider fighting only for herself and for her donors im an outsider fighting for you everything  everything you need to know about hillary clinton sometimes referred to as crooked hillary can be understood with a simple but very important phrase follow the money the large corporations who support terrible trade deals offshore jobs they take these jobs they offshore the jobs theyre donating to hillary clinton its called follow the money the wall street investors who have rigged the regulations against the middle class theyre donating to hillary clinton follow the money the wealthy donors want to shutdown american energy theyre donating to hillary clinton follow the money the special interests who want to open borders are donating to hillary clinton again just follow the money in her campaign for president hillary clinton has received  million in contributions from wall street and hedge funds she and bill were paid  million for speeches since bill left the oval office and she doesnt speak well figure that one in fact they had a very small group of people which you here yesterday very small crows very very sad  hundred million dollars i dont think so folks whats going on the same groups paying bill and hillary for the speeches were lobbying the federal government twentytwo groups paying bill clinton for speeches lobbying the state department while hillary clinton was secretary of state favors and access were granted to those who wrote checks she put the office of secretary of state up for sale and if she ever got the chance she put the oval office up for sale too  she deleted and bleached  emails after a congressional subpoena was issued after  think of it after she gets a subpoena  she gets a subpoena she sees the subpoena she then gets rid of  emails on top of a lot of other things if you did that in your civilian life you would have problems for the rest of your life thirteen phones missing several destroyed with a hammer who in this room has destroyed their phone with a hammer anybody anybody oh there is one person what business is that person in i want to find out yes well benghazi is a horrible thing you saw what happened about taking th amendment and her ring leaders getting immunity deals will call them really the fbi immunity five nobody has ever seen they gave so much immunity there was nobody left to talk too there was nobody left except hillary they probably gave her immunity too do you think hillary got immunity yeah she got the immunity she had something you know when you think of it she did so much worse than anybody else people that did a tiny fraction of what she did their lives have been destroyed and here she is running for president its a dishonestly its a disgrace foreign enemies with easy access to hack her server and they did lies to congress under a  about turning over her work related emails remember she said on her emails it was about yoga classes and it was about a wedding  yoga wedding she and her financial backers will say anything do anything lie about anything to keep their grip on power to keep their control over this country the american people have had it with years and decades of clinton corruption and scandals corruption and scandals  and impeachment for lying  impeachment for lying remember that impeach theyre tired of the lies theyre tired of the tribunal politics theyre tired of being talked down too look down upon and treated like second class citizens and theyre phenomenal people you are phenomenal people but clintons are disordered pass we will be very bright and clean future  while our campaign outlines big changes and bold solutions to make your life better the clinton campaign focuses only on small and petty destructions this will be the year the american people say finally enough is enough its gonna start with new hampshire  hillary clinton has been a disaster for so many communities but especially for africanamerican communities i dont think african americans are going to come out and vote for clinton theyre too smart and they know they are just being used by her and her campaign  they also know that shell do nothing for them once the election is over she never does and that will never ever change many of them will never forget her calling young africanamerican men super predators not nice same thing goes for hispanic voters and they are tired of being used by people like hillary clinton that have no intention of doing anything for them once the election is over a trump administration will bring prosperity to all of the people of our great country  well bring prosperity look at what happened to your jobs look at what happened to your jobs look at what happened to all of those companies that left and went to mexico and other places and you are probably the number one group of people that were affected if you think about it and the whole country my economic agenda can be summed up with three very beautiful words jobs jobs jobs were going to pass the biggest tax cut since ronald reagan and were going to lower  thats right and remember shes raising taxes substantially and were going to lower the business rate from  percent all the way down to  percent making america into a magnet for new jobs and growth  every wasteful and unnecessary regulation will be eliminated along with every illegal executive order we will unleash the power of american energy were going and were sitting right now sitting on  trillion of untapped energy reserves and were going to put that wealth into the pockets of the american people  and were going to start reducing debt common core will be ended and disadvantage  and disadvantage children will be allow to attend the school of their choice choice big word choice very important word the catastrophe known as obamacare will be repealed and replaced  and its dying of its own volition anyway you see whats happening its dying and the disastrous trade deals like nafta that have caused so much pain in new hemisphere will be renegotiated and i mean renegotiated for your benefit not to the benefit of mexico were going to either change it or well start all over again folks and it will be a big big difference believe me nafta was signed by bill clinton and supported by crooked hillary and your state has lost one and three manufactory jobs since it was approved its a catastrophe its the worst trade deal ever negotiated and ever made  not only in the united states probably anywhere in the world theres never been a deal like this youve lost one and four jobs think of it since china entered the world trade organization so you lost one and four  this another deal with the clintons and hillary clinton has been on the wrong side of every major trade deal in her career and if that she gets the chance  and this is a  percent  she would approve to transpacific partnership which will destroy so much more of your manufacturing in the state hillary clinton is merely a vessel for the special interest trying to script this contrive its wealth its jobs and its status as a sovereign nation remember she called tpp the goal standard and then during the debate the night where every single online poll said we won  which is great  every single online poll  and during the debate the other night she was saying no she never said that she said it i mean she said it and then i had to put up  then i had to put up with the anchor and fight the anchor all the time on everything i said what a rigged deal ill tell you where in such a rig sits   it is terrible whats going on in this country is so sad but it will change remember november th november th  she called it the goal standard its the goal standard for destroying wealth and jobs shes a globalist who has made a career of taking jobs from our country and giving them to other countries im not running to be president of the world im running to be president of the united states of america and were going to do a great job  from now on its going to be america first america first   have you ever wondered why its that old things that the american people want they never seem to happened things they want just dont happen just thing about it for how many years have the american people asked for a tax code to be fixed or for infrastructure to be repaired weve been talking about this for years or for the waste to be removed from our budget for many years and how many have voters pleaded for secure borders fair trade deals just fair deals were going to make great deals by the way were going to make great deals but just fair deals and quality schools that serve parents and students all the things youve ever wanted for your country have been denied theyve been denied the reason is very simple its because the financial interest who control our politics and our media dont want this changes to happen the special interest control totally hillary clinton look at the money somebody said shes spending on commercials in certain areas  to one and were tied or im leading  how do you do that fifty think of it fifty commercials to every one im putting up and were tied and im even leading in some of these areas shes there chosen representative shes been there for  years and has never done anything for you or your family shes there for only one reason to protect their donors and collect their money our campaign is taken on big business big media and big donors were taking them on for you thats what were doing i didnt need to do this believe me i built a great great company i didnt need to do this were going to straighten it out  we want you to have the future that you want and that you deserve that includes very importantly keeping your family safe new fbi statistics just out show that homicide rose  percent last year in americas large cities and that is the biggest single year increase in  years you

greatly from the heroin crisis and the drugs pouring across the border the rate of heroin overdose has nearly quadrupled in the state once again our politicians have tragically failed this country and

ways away and some people didnt give us a good chance they said mr trump the other day one of the biggest people in that business the very dishonest press business  they said mr trump when you started off you have to tell me the truth did you really think youd be here i said what the hell do you think im doing this for right  no we expected to be here and were all here together its a movement and believe me were all here together were going to take our country back  were going to win the state of michigan were going to win the white house and its going to be an awfully good november th that evening is going to be a celebration  were going to take on the special interests the lobbyists and the powerful politicians that have stolen your jobs through theft and incompetence theyve stolen your wealth theyve taken your middle class were going to take on the arrogant corrupt corporate media that have enabled the global theft of american prosperity  a theft that has left behind crumbling schools roads bridges and a totally depleted military we have the greatest people in the world in our military were going to rebuild our military this is when we need it  its time by the way to rebuild detroit were going to rebuild detroit its time to rebuild michigan and were not letting them take your jobs out of michigan any longer  and its time to rebuild the united states of america were going to do it our country is going to be greater than ever before were going to be the smart country again  hillary clinton has made a living raking in donations from special interests that have raided our factories and ripped the jobs right out of michigan and every other state  thats how she gets rich by taking your jobs and your money away from you and away from your state   thats why hillary clinton if she ever got the chance would  percent approve the transpacific partnership  the deal she lied about the other night when i said she called it the gold standard she said no guess what she called it the gold standard and lester holt didnt correct her i wonder why  the transpacific partnership will economically devastate michigan new hampshire north carolina pennsylvania wisconsin and so many other states all across this country it will be devastating also for ohio hillary clintons donors want the tpp and their wish will be her command thats what it is the special interests pay her for speeches and shes not a good speaker not a good speaker they pay her a lot of money you know we have thousands of people here today there are thousands and thousands of people outside trying to get in thousands  and theyre coming and in fact i was going to ask you should we hold it up for a couple of hours let everyone pour in you know theyre all checked the answer is no right thank you no theyll get in they pay her foundation they pay her husband in return they get your jobs like ive been saying all week when it comes to hillary clinton all you have to do is remember these words follow the money thats good  thats become very popular i will say hillary clinton praised or pushed tpp on  separate occasions her close associate and confidante governor terry mcauliffe said shed pass it dont worry her husband talks it up everyone knows shes for it because she doesnt believe in protecting american jobs or american sovereignty she doesnt believe it hillary clinton only believes in protecting her special interests and her donors of the  companies that lobbied for the passage of tpp  or nearly  in  donated between  million and  million to the clinton foundation think about it  nine companies that lobbied for the passage of tpp paid hillary clinton  million for paid speeches who would want to hear hillary clintons peak and pay her     who you think so  you know so were going to have  people here easy including outside much more than that if she came here tomorrow if she got  people seriously i think it would be a shock right it would be a shock three tpp member countries gave between  million and  million think of that at least four lobbyists who are actively lobbying for tpp passage have raised more than  for her campaign on november th we are going to end clinton corruption weve had enough  and were going to do something that has been a long long time in coming we are going to put america first we are going to put america first  hillary clinton is an insider fighting only for herself and for her donors im an outsider fighting for you we have a movement like theyve never seen in this country before the corrupt media which is totally corrupt  these people back there totally corrupt  working along with the political establishment and the establishment is panicking because they know this is awfully tough to stop whats happening right now folks awfully tough  the news anchors and the donors and the lobbyists who are used to getting their way are trying to do everything they can to help crooked hillary clinton and cling to their power and their prestige and their money the arrogant political class doesnt believe in protecting jobs and wages for americans you know we have many people in the audience  and all over the country  that made more money in real wages  and  years ago than theyre making now and now because of obamacare and other reasons theyre being forced to work two jobs sometimes three jobs so theyre getting older theyre working harder and theyre being paid less not good the only thing i can say is that im getting older and im working harder also ok so  im putting myself in your category its true   thank you oh thats so true though isnt it the special interests dont believe in secure borders and strong walls the washington and wall street insiders dont believe in hiring more police producing more american energy or giving school choice to poor children trapped in failing schools and we are by the way going to end common core and bring education local  for decades weve talked about the corruption and incompetence and failures of our leaders in   its a long awaited chance to deliver the change that youve been waiting for for a long time and to hold our politicians accountable if you do this one simple thing you can deliver justice for every single person who has been wronged by the system on november th show up and vote    show up and vote folks show up and vote if you are so sick if you get the worst report you could possibly get for the doctor if the doctor says im sorry jim im sorry alice im sorry whoever it is youre not going to make it youre not going to make it youll be gone by the end of november i dont give a damn show up and vote on november th  no we dont want that to happen we dont want that to happen when you cast that ballot just picture a wall street boardroom filled with the special interests who have been bleeding your country and your city and every place else and imagine the look on their faces when you tell them youre fired fired  and were going to tell millions and millions of unemployed americans my favorite two words youre hired  when we get it going folks millions of jobs are going to come pouring back into our country were going to reverse the trend right now we have a superhighway it goes in one direction out of our country our jobs are gone our moneys gone our wealth is gone we owe  trillion obama has doubled the debt doubled it in his term in office  trillion  and we havent done anything our roads are bad our schools are bad our airports are bad our hospitals are bad our bridges our tunnels theyre all falling apart you know its one thing if we would have spent the money and fixed our country weve spent  trillion in the middle east we could have rebuilt our country twice now the media doesnt want to talk about hillary clinton and her corruption so were going to spell it out for them today  the large corporations who support terrible trade deals that ship your jobs overseas and out of our country theyre donating to hillary clinton follow the money the wall street investors who have rigged the regulations against the middle class theyre donating to hillary clinton follow the money the wealthy donors who want to shut down american energy theyre donating to hillary clinton follow the money the special interests who want open borders are donating to hillary clinton definitely follow the money in her campaign for president hillary clinton has received  million in contributions from wall street and hedge funds and by the way  by the way im spending a lot of money on my campaign and why isnt she spending some money on hers im spending  million you know what im spending i think ill be over  million but you know whats nice when they call me and they say mr president you have to do this you have to do that ill say i dont have to do anything for anybody  the only one that im working for is you thats the only one you watch  so many things are done adverse to the country and ive spent a tremendous  tens and tens of millions of dollars on the primaries and now on the general election and im very proud to have done it i will tell you and i dont know to this extent if its ever been done before certainly not recently but im very proud to have done it because were going to maintain our independence we have millions and millions of dollars coming in from small donors average  like  a shot and thats really helping to fund the campaign also but these are people who are investing in our country these are great great people theyre investing in our country so hillary and bill were paid  million for speeches since bill clinton left the oval office  million  did they get their moneys worth well maybe they did not from the speech the same groups are paying bill and hillary for their speeches these were the groups that were lobbying in many cases the federal government im shocked twentytwo groups paid bill clinton for speeches lobbied the state department while hillary was secretary of state shocking favors and access were granted to those who wrote checks she put the office of secretary of state up for sale and she never ever got the chance and she will get the chance if we dont get out to vote she will get the chance and we cant let that happen because if she gets the chance she will put the oval office up for sale like she always does  remember folks shes been doing this for  years and she  she just doesnt produce she deleted and bleached  emails after a congressional subpoena you cant do that    after the subpoena how about this you get a federal subpoena you get a subpoena from congress i mean how high can it get to give your emails to give your papers to give everything it isnt before you get the subpoena this is after you get the subpoena and after you get the subpoena you delete and bleach a process nobody ever heard of  who heard of that in this room did anybody ever hear of it they call it bleaching they call it acid washing and a lot of people dont do it because its supposed to be very expensive but nobody heard of it so she gets the subpoena she doesnt like it she says in my opinion or somebody does but she says delete all of my emails delete them and then she said and by the way is there another process where they can never find them yes maam we can bleach them then bleach them because i dont want anybody to see the wedding and the yoga classes right she said there were wedding and yoga class tweets i give five for the wedding and three for the yoga class but what about the rest in addition she got rid of  phones that were missing or gone and several were destroyed by a hammer whoever destroyed your phone with a hammer is there anybody theres one person  what business are you in  foreign enemies with easy access to hack  and believe me shes vulnerable and she makes us vulnerable because foreign enemies  you look at her server and theyre probably hacking her all over the place unfortunately maybe well find out at a later date lies to congress under oath she lies to congress how many times did she lie to congress and then the media protects her and they dont talk about that and if im a little bit off trump lies lies she lied to congress so many times  and how about her people and representatives taking the fifth amendment and her ringleaders getting immunity deals five deals five five immunity deals we call them now the fbi immunity five so listen to this listen to this heres my question for hillary clinton can you promise that not one of the five people who were granted criminal immunity will ever be allowed to serve in a clinton administration if that ever happens oh would that be bad  lets see what happens and heres the demand im making today to president obama  mr president will you pledge not to issue a pardon to hillary clinton and her coconspirators for their many crimes against our country and against society itself will you make that pledge  no one is above the law clinton and her cronies will say anything do anything lie about anything to keep their grip on power to keep their control over our country remember the clinton pardon of fugitive  and this was a serious fugitive  marc rich in exchange for unknown and undisclosed amounts of money you remember that marc rich famous marc rich people couldnt believe it the american people have had it with years or decades of clinton corruption and scandals always the same thing whitewater the cattle remember the cattle i think she had the greatest return on a cattle investment in the history of the cattle world guys that did it all their lives they said wow she must know a lot about cattle the people of this country are tired of the lies theyre tired of trivial politics theyre tired of being talked down to looked down upon and treated like secondclass citizens  this will finally be the year that the american people say enough is enough  hillary clinton has been a disaster for so many communities but especially for the africanamerican communities i dont think africanamericans are going to come out and vote for clinton theyre too smart and they know they are being used theyre tired of them  they also know from tremendous past experience that shell do nothing for them once the election is over she never does and that will never change many of them will not forget her calling young africanamerican men super predators  super predator to the africanamerican community let me ask you this question are you better off than you were eight years ago no if not why not give donald trump a chance i will fix it  i will bring back jobs ill bring back your education which is a total disaster in the inner cities and im going to bring back safe neighborhoods  if you keep voting for the same people you will keep getting the exact same results look at what the democrats have done to detroit half of detroit residents are unable to work nearly  percent of the city lives in poverty its the secondmost dangerous city in america according to the fbi this is the legacy of the policies embraced by crooked hillary clinton a trump administration will bring prosperity to all of our people my economic agenda can be summed up with three very beautiful words jobs jobs jobs were bringing our jobs back  were going to pass the biggest tax cut since ronald reagan and by the way hillary clinton is going to raise your taxes every wasteful and unnecessary regulation will be immediately eliminated theyre choking our businesses and stopping our jobs we will unleash the power of american energy the catastrophe known as obamacare will be repealed and replaced  and the disastrous trade deals like nafta signed by bill clinton that have caused so much pain in michigan and ohio and pennsylvania and everywhere in this country will be renegotiated and well be bring back your auto manufacturing business like youve never ever seen it before  michigan has lost more than  in  of its manufacturing jobs since the twin disasters of nafta and chinas entrance into the wto another bill clinton disaster before nafta went into effect there were  autoworkers in michigan today that number is only  and believe me its going down and going down fast and after the election if somebody else should win youre going to see really big reductions in those numbers i can promise you that because thats what theyre going to do  and ive been talking about michigan i was honored here years ago  and we set the alltime record years ago long before i ever thought i was going to be doing this  whoever thought i was going to run for office i was going to be a politician cant believe  somebody said donald youre a politician i said please i dont want to hear that but whoever thought but long before i thought about doing this i was honored in michigan and i talked about your car industries moving out and had i run for office then and won you would have double and triple the number of workers in your car industry your automobile industry ill guarantee you that but well get them back anyway ford just announced that its moving its small car production to mexico  so it used to be that the cars were made in flint and you couldnt drink the water in mexico today the cars are made in mexico and you cant drink the water in flint  thats whats happened to our country hillary clinton also gave us the jobkilling trade deal with south korea which has been a disaster its cost our country another  jobs and hillary opposed the korea deal when she was running for president in  she campaigned right here in michigan and said the korean deal will hurt the united states auto industry increase our trade deficit cost us good middleclass jobs and make america less competitive she pledged to you to reject the deal but she lied as always she lied  once installed as secretary of state she supported it and called it a cuttingedge transaction  same things going to happen with tpp dont give her the chance folks youre going to lose all your jobs dont forget when she ran for the senate in new york state she said she was going to bring back jobs in upstate new york it was a total lie we lost more and more jobs and today its a total disaster she rammed it through as she always tries to do her donors were happy they were all extremely friendly to her they helped her out everybody was satisfied except for the workers of our country we lost our jobs the us trade deficit with korea for the top  products that michigan exports to korea grew  percent as exports fell and imports rose so it was an exact opposite of what she said and she probably knew it although i personally think shes incompetent she might not have known it dont forget she has a distinction she failed her bar exam in washington dc remember that thats a big distinction this is what hillary clinton did for your state according to the economic policy institute michigan ranks first for jobs lost as a share of workforce due to the trade deficit with tpp members ok  just imagine how many more jobs will be lost if the tpp actually gets approved as hillary clinton wants to make sure it happens hillary clinton is merely a vessel for the special interests trying to strip this country of its wealth its jobs and its status as a sovereign nation she even supports the disastrous surrender of americas control of the internet which is happening now  how about obama how about obama wants to give the internet let it be given to the world  what a bunch of people we have representing us what a bunch of people see how nice im doing you know a year ago i would have said something vicious and they would have said donald trump uses foul language what a group we have how about where obama on the worst deal that ive ever seen negotiated the iran deal started by hillary clinton by the way which will give them nuclear weapons in less than  years and its an easy path but how about where he gave them  million in cash  and then it turned out to be wrong it was  billion in cash can you believe it you know what that is its take that corner of the room and stack the cash to the ceiling nobodys seen that has anybody ever seen  billion in cash what a bunch of losers we have hillary clintons website says she supports the decision to give away the internet to a global community of stakeholders isnt that nice we come up with the internet and they want to give it away isnt that wonderful someone needs to inform hillary clinton its not the job of our leaders to represent the global community  its the job of our leaders to represent american citizens    we invent the internet lets just give it away folks lets just give it away but it really is  honestly is it hard to believe or what forget about running for office forget about voting forget about politics can you believe the things they do  million oh turns out to be  billion in cash the internet how about last week where they were going to deport  people now they have a reason they were going to deport them right so they were going to deport  people and guess what something went wrong and instead of deporting them they became citizens of the united states of america  only in america don king who supported me big don he goes only in america can that happen but they were wrong but there was a mistake there was a mistake it turned out that the  person number was wrong it looks like its now going to be close to   and then i said ok they made a big mistake lets turn it around and lets deport them and they said but that wouldnt be constitutional can you believe these people can you can you believe these people america losing control of the internet to foreign entities is just one more way obamaclinton have sold out the citizens of this country somebodys benefiting by that deal because nobody can be so stupid to make a deal like that somebody is benefiting by that deal hillary clinton is a globalist who will never protect the freedom and jobs of the american people im not running to be president of the world im running to be president of the united states of america    have you ever wondered why it is that all things that the american people want never ever seem to happen the reason is simple its because the financial interests who control our politics and our media which is one of the most dishonest groups of people ever in this country  like for instance look at this massive crowd they dont show the crowd folks i go home my wife said oh were there many people i say thousands she goes really i didnt see them i didnt see them they dont show them hey cameras why dont you span the room and show the room cameras span the room  they wont do it they wont do it they never do it they never do it theyre dishonest people   dishonest people i remember during the primaries  i remember during the primaries when bernie sanders was doing well he made a terrible deal he sold out to the devil you know that and now people dont even want to show up for bernie he sold out he should have never made that deal he should have gone down he would have been an american hero he sold out to hillary clinton he sold out to the devil and his people dont want anything to do with him he had an event the other day almost nobody showed up but i remember when he was hot and he was getting big crowds and i had an event at the same time a little different location i had  people he had  people and the media reported it and they said donald trump had a rally tonight and then he started falling asleep  then they reported on bernie sanders bernie sanders had a massive crowd of  people tonight  people you know what  people is its like a little piece of that corner of the room  so for him  its true so for crazy bernie they had a little  for me they dont want to report it but thats ok because we understand whats happening just as long as you know how dishonest these people are and boy were they dishonest on the debate man they were  theres never been dishonesty and by the way by the way it was just announced by the commission that holds the debate that donald trumps microphone was defective as ive been saying  i mean working that microphone was a hell of a lot more difficult than working crooked hillary clinton that i can tell you they just announced  it just came out a little while ago that the microphone in the audience the big room was defective and it was not  it was difficult and you know when you have a situation like that and you know its bad and you think you have  million people watching what do you do stop the show please fix it it was bad i wonder why it was bad think of that i wonder why it was bad it was so bad hillary clinton has been there for  years and has never done anything for you or your family and she never will just look how badly she messed up the iran deal and just today we learned that on the same day as the hostages were released the united states signed an agreement lifting sanctions on two iranian banks involved in financing irans missile program  and you know where they want those missiles to eventually land dont you folks huh right here right here right here in this country thats where they want them to land and theyre taunting us with the boats theyre taunting us with the  sailors they captured theyre taunting us by flying right next to our airplanes so we give them all this money  billion back we give them the deal of a lifetime and instead of saying thank you they feel emboldened that wont happen with us folks so just think of what i said before the way she failed upstate new york the way she promised all those jobs that never happened our campaign is taking on big business were taking on big media and its not pleasant i have never ever in my life received stories like i receive now i mean it is called the greatest pileon in the history of america even journalists that dont like me say its the craziest thing theyve ever seen but im doing it  im doing it everybody who knows im doing it for everybody doing it for you  our campaign is about breaking up the special interest monopoly in washington dc were trying to disrupt the collusion between the wealthy donors the large corporations and the media executives theyre all part of the same corrupt political establishment and they nod along when hillary clinton slanders you as deplorable and irredeemable youre deplorable and irredeemable she says  see she doesnt know you like i know you you are the smartest people were the strongest people were the most loyal people ever to be involved in a campaign  i call you hardworking american patriots and together we are going to save this country and were not going to have a second chance folks if we dont do it on november th its not going to happen i dont believe  if we have to have barack obama but worse for four more years i honestly believe our country can never recovery and remember supreme court judges remember that but together we can accomplish anything we want but that means you need to show up on november th we have  days until the election you have  days to make every dream you ever dreamed for your country come true do not let this opportunity slip away get out and vote and make sure everything is on the upandup    make sure everything is on the upandup youve been reading the same stories as ive been reading so go to your place and vote and go pick some other place and go sit there with your friends and make sure its on the upandup because you know what thats a big big problem in this country and nobody wants to talk about it nobody has the guts to talk about it so go and watch these polling places make sure its on the upandup please  that would be one hell of a way to lose ill tell you right now you have one magnificent chance to deliver justice for every forgotten man woman and child in this nation  and there are a lot  the arrogance of washington dc will soon come facetoface with the righteous verdict of the american voter

80,"Trump","thank you everybody thank you  thank you  oh look at this boy what a  what a response from our greatest people thank you very much thank you  well at least i definitely know the military likes trump right thats great its  youre amazing people are  great people and i very much appreciate it and speaking of that we will have this week over  admirals and generals endorsing trump and that to me is a fantastic honor in addition we had  now we have  folks congressional medal of honor recipients and to have that many is very unusual and a tremendous honor ive met many of them over the last two weeks and that to me is just a great honor so i wanna thank everybody  i wanna thank everybody in this room and its a privilege to be here this morning with you so many distinguished members of our services and thats really what you are very very highly distinguished members before we get started were going to have a qampa in a little while id like to address one of the most important aspects of americas national security and thats cyber security to truly make america safe we must make cyber security a major priority which i dont believe were doing right now for both government and the private sector cyber theft is the fastest growing crime in the united states by far as president improving cyber security will be an immediate and top priority for my administration one of the very first things i will do is to order a thorough review of our cyber defenses and weaknesses we have very substantial weaknesses including all vital infrastructures cyber attacks from foreign governments especially china russia north korea along with nonstate terrorist actors and organized criminal groups constitute one of our most critical national security concerns theyre leaning everything about us and we dont have  wanna have any servers in the basements by the way folks has anybody here  has anybody in this group  i know our congressmen hasnt done it has anybody put a server in their basement oh boy hillary clintons only  hillary clintons only experience in cyber security involves her criminal scheme to violate federal law engineering a massive cover up and putting the entire nation in harms way  the fact that a former senator and secretary of state claimed not to know what the letter c means is just one more example of why she is totally unfit to hold the office of president totally unfit  its interesting that during her fbi review which took place on a massive holiday and which wasnt recorded and lots of other things that she went  times she didnt remember she didnt remember she doesnt remember anything she remembered practically nothing but when she has to remember something she remembers its a very sad situation i will tell you im sure the folks in this room are not thrilled the scope of our cybersecurity problem is enormous our government our businesses our trade secrets and our citizens most sensitive information are all facing constant cyberattacks and reviews  by the enemy just consider some of these recent hacks jpmorgan chase massive bank had  million emails stolen ebay was involved and gave up  million passwords target was attacked and gave up  million credit card numbers attacks like these are happening on a regular basis both in the united states and around the world and the costs in terms of privacy our security and our financial sector are truly extraordinary identity theft financial laundering as well as ransom and ransomware  i mean think of it  all involving extortion of a hacked institution are becoming increasingly common they are extorting institutions incredibly hackers were able to obtain at least  million identities of people who under fbi background and were under fbi background investigations the information hack contains facts discovered by the fbi in doing background checks for people seeking positions with the federal government its a treasure trove which can easily be used for blackmail and other reasons by the enemy the fact that this highly classified information of very very important people in many cases was so poorly protected demonstrates that cybersecurity is just one more area where the obama administration has failed and speaking of failure when we do our question and answer period you look at whats happened with our navy in terms of the number of ships and our armed forces generally how they are so depleted how they are at almost recordsetting lows and in some cases absolute recordsetting lows it is very very unfortunate and very very dangerous for our country we should not let this be like the history of the mafia which was allowed to grow into a nationwide organization which infiltrated and corrupted so many areas of society for such a long period of time we can learn from this history that when the department of justice the fbi the dea and the state and local police and prosecutors were combined in a task force directed by and at the mafia when they looked at the mafia and really went after them they were able to get great great successes and prosecutions out of them and seizing their business interests did a lot of things including their business interests taking them away and removing their infiltration from legitimate areas of society theyve been very very effective when everybody got together that was a long time ago  as president i will instruct the department of justice to create a joint task force throughout the united states to work together with federal state and local law enforcement authorities and international law enforcement to crush this stilldeveloping area of crime and its getting bigger very fast its gonna be harder and harder to do i will make certain that our military is the best in the world in both cyber offense and defense and in every other way by the way every other way  weve rarely needed it more than we do right now i will also ask my secretary of defense and joint chiefs to present recommendations for strengthening and augmenting our cyber command as a deterrent against attacks on our critical resources the united states must possess  and has to  the unquestioned capacity to launch crippling cyber counter attacks and i mean crippling crippling this is the warfare of the future americas dominance in this arena must be unquestioned and today its totally questioned people dont even know if we have the capability that were supposed to have when you look at whats going on with other countries cybersecurity is not only a question of developing defensive technologies but offensive technologies as well for nonstate terror actors the united states must develop the ability no matter how difficult to track down and incapacitate those responsible and do it rapidly we should turn cyber warfare into one of our greatest weapons against the terrorists and they have to know its coming because right now they know nothing about us it just seems they have an open blanket its like an open mark do whatever you wanna do nothings gonna happen take our youth out of the country infiltrate our country in so many different ways we cant let this happen we have to have it stopped immediately before its too late  to enhance the defense of the other agencies of government including our law enforcement agencies  so important theyre doing such a great job by the way  we will put together a team of our best military civilian and private sector cybersecurity experts to comprehensively review all of our cybersecurity systems and technologies the cyber review team will proceed with the most sensitive systems first but ultimately all systems will be analyzed and made as secure as modern technology permits and hopefully thats gonna be our technology we will also require that followup reviews take place on a regular basis determined by the sensitive nature of the security involved the review will be very much exact and recommended by experts we want experts our finest people we dont want people that are b level c level d level we have to get our absolute best and the recommendations have to be a combination of defensive technologies tailored to specific agencies and every other discipline involved this will include the various methods of internal monitoring attack and penetration investigation of suspected hackers or rogue employees  and you have plenty of rogue employees  and identity protection for government employees the review team will also remain current on the constantly evolving new methods of attack and will attempt to anticipate them and develop defenses as often as possible before breaches occur  and there are ways of doing this through modern technology but we are not using that and frankly our technology is not up to date were letting it slip by and with technology as we know it can go very very rapidly this group of experts will set up protocols for each agency and government officials requiring them to follow best and strongest practices they will also establish a training program for all government employees to make certain that they understand what defenses are available and utilize them along with a continuing education program so everyone is aware of the newest methods of both attack and defense that means attack and defense those who violate classification rules will be held responsible to the fullest extent of the law something which we dont do too much anymore  you know in our country lately were more interested in protecting the criminals than we are in making sure that were strong and powerful and know what were doing were so so interested in protecting criminals and people that want to do us harm and i think we have to go back to a little more oldfashioned method of thinking if that makes sense i will appoint an attorney general who will reform the department of justice like it was necessary after watergate my attorney general will restore the integrity of the department of justice which has been severely questioned today is just  frankly nobodys every seen anything like whats happening today when you have somebody getting a subpoena from the united states congress to have your emails and all other information sent and after  not before after getting the subpoena  emails are deleted and acid washed and nobody even knows what that means acid wash its a very expensive thing to do most people dont even know what it means when you see something like that and theres no crime everythings just wonderful you know if you were in a private case with mr smith and they call for your records and you get rid of your records so blatantly as this you have serious consequences like the most serious consequences the congressman sends out a tremendous subpoena they want to see the emails and they delete the emails i cant think of anything in terms of were talking about much more serious than that congressman do you agree its hard to believe hard to believe that they can get away with this kind of thing today is just to the beginning of a long and overdue national discussion on how to protect ourselves from modern cyber crime and evolving national security threats and how to develop the cyber offense strategies necessary to gain a critical security edge in the st century we need the edge and ideally a big one  i want to thank everybody in this room i have such respect for the people in this room for being here and now lets begin our discussion thank you very much folks thank you       well general thank you and thank you for your bravery amazing ive heard your name mentioned many times so thank you for being here and thank you for the question not only the army the navy the air force the marines everything is going away at a time when certainly we are at a top priority for making sure that doesnt happen were not respected to the extent that we were and if we keep going like this we wont be respected at all you look at russias doing with their nuclear capability and the newness of their capability and look at were  what were doing and nobody wants to do that with respect to nukes because nukes are horrible but you have countries that are going out of their way to do things that were not doing and we have to be very very careful the size of the army absolutely its getting too small in fact a certain general when he left about a year and a half ago said we are not only too small were the least prepared that weve ever been since he can remember  the least prepared so its a combination of that  of both look i feel so strongly that i use a different word in going around that our forces are depleted  theyre depleted we have the greatest people on earth but theyre depleted you see where the fighter jets are so old that they cant get parts anymore they have to go to plane  airplane graveyards and museums to get parts for our fighter jets that were currently using they dont make the parts and you have other countries that have brand new equipment and in some cases we sell them the equipment the whole thing is ridiculous now were gonna build up our forces including the army but we are gonna build up our forces we have no choice you know they can talk about sequester they can talk about all of the different things that theyve  theyre doing but this isnt like we have a choice this is something where  and were gonna be cutting elements of government certainly but when it comes to the military we have no choice we cannot have a depleted military we have to have the strongest military by far and with that being said as you know we spend a lot of money on protecting other countries and yet those other countries arent paying nearly what it costs us for that protection where  theyre getting one of the great bargains of all time but were spending on numerous countries very substantial countries you know the countries were talking about but were defending them for a fraction of the cost we have to go to those countries and we have to ask them to make contributions that are greater than the contributions theyre making right now you know were gonna protect them were gonna remain loyal to them but at the same time its a twoway street they have to help us also so i think your question is a great one we will build our military forces to a level that will be i believe stronger than ever before if i become president of the united states ok thank you     hello general   well it is confusion not only there but its confusion in many other fields long beyond military and defense the countrys confused in terms of even the divide in our country we have such a divide and really divides we have many different forms of divides so theres a lot of confusion but we have a president that wont use the term radical islamic terrorism wont use it will spend long periods of time explaining to people why he wont use it at the end of the explanation nobody knows why he still wont use it because the explanation is no good and i mean honestly we have a president that in my opinion really doesnt know what hes doing we have a president that doesnt know whats happening and when it comes to the military you know i always say keep the oil i said dont go in but i said keep the oil had we kept the oil you wouldnt have isis because they fuel their growth with the oil but i read something and saw something over the weekend that really bothered me because i believe in  im a big fan of general douglas macarthur and general george patton and you know these great generals some of the generals  big fan of some of the generals in this room we have  general flynn is with us and general kellogg we have a few generals that have been so incredible to me now we have  but generals and admirals im never gonna forget admirals right those admirals  i will never forget the admirals that i can promise you but it was very disconcerting when i saw that an attack is planned on mosul an attack is planned and you know were involved in the attack but the iraqi forces are planning an attack on mosul it should happen over a short period of time and the work will be  why do we have to talk about it why i never saw anything like this every time we are going to attack somebody we explain were going to attack well be attacking at three noon on march th i dont know unless you disagree with me wouldnt it be better if we were going to go after mosul to not say anything and do it as opposed to announcing  theyre announcing all over television theyre planning to attack mosul  and whenever they asked me the question about what are you going to do about isis i say you know i have a real chance of winning i dont really want to tell you i have very strong ideas and ill be dealing with the people in this room and other folks that are you know very good at this but the last thing you want to do is give notice to the enemy when president obama announced that he was leaving iraq i mean he was talking about dates and times and what were going to do  the enemy pulls back we think were doing well well they pull back theyre not stupid and then after we leave you see what happened so i just  i just want to say that we are going to hit isis hard and i mean really hard but i do think this the american public doesnt have to know the date and hour and second that were going to attack and from what side were going to attack were going to attack from the eastern quadrant and itll take place on a certain day at a certain hour we dont need to  they just want to see victory we dont have victory i mean were dropping our  were dropping things all over the place who knows what theyre hitting who knows how many people are being killed and who knows if theyre the right people but at some point we have to stop a force thats going out and drowning people in steel cages and chopping off heads these are barbaric people these are people that  you know i used to study medieval times and you know they chopped off heads but until recently this was a phenomena that you wouldnt see the level of barbarism is unbelievable so were gonna stop them were gonna stop them cold were gonna stop them very powerfully but i dont think all of us should be  unless its a very confined room we shouldnt be giving up our plans and it bothers me every time i see where were planning to attack this one that one but the one i saw over the weekend was mosul and theyre talking about attacking the other problem is you have a lot of the leaders in mosul well theyre not gonna be there theyre getting out because they hear theyre gonna be attacked so theyre getting out theyre going some place  congressman would you agree with this if im a leader and im seeing and im watching what everybody else is watching and an attack on mosul is imminent im saying bye folks have a good time im moving into a different city  so what are they doing can there be allowed  are we allowed to have any more in the military general the element of surprise you know i would think it would be a good thing its called an ancient strength and we dont use it anymore   i think its one of the great principles the element of surprise i mean you could take a force thats not nearly as strong and with the element of surprise you could wipe out a much more powerful force and i dont pretend to be a general or an admiral or anything else but i just  every time i see  i see president obama get up ladies and gentleman we are sending  people to iraq  so thats bad in two ways number one its such a low number that the enemys saying is that all  and number two when you think  those people now have a target on their back they wanna find those  people and they look for those  people when hillary clinton says no boots on the ground now whether you want boots on the ground or not you shouldnt say it because youve just taken  so she said there will be no boots on the ground shes very strong  because politics you know it sounds a little bit better to say no boots on the ground but by doing that she has empowered the enemy shes empowered the enemy and i think she possibly means it im not sure if she means it or not but she says no boots on the ground she has taken a tremendous  i mean thats really giving strength to the enemy and even if she felt that she should never admit that she should never admit that you have to leave all your options open and if you dont leave your options open youre a fool and i hated to hear her say that   their days  their days will be numbered very quickly      i will never   i dont have the courage to do that    ok so first of all i want to ask you one question you had all those aircraft landings on the carriers right so can an otherwise excellent pilot a very very good pilot because ive heard that some just cant do this what percentage of very very good pilots cannot land on an aircraft carrier with training   after training   because i understand its a very very special talent   ok very good see he puts it down a little bit thats very good    thats very good ive heard its very very tough the veterans administration is a disaster the va its a disaster i have gone to all over the country and ive met so many veterans and i have tremendous veteran support and i see what those people are going through to see a doctor sometimes it takes six and seven days and then you finally get there and the doctor is gone on vacation we have to change that whole system it starts with management we have to have a whole different set of protocols and we have to get people off the lines you know people are dying not only the  suicides a day which is inconceivable when you hear that when i first heard that i said no you mean a month i mean can you imagine a day  suicides a day a lot of the suicide is people cant get to see doctors a lot of it because the waits are so long thats an administrative problem and by the way the va has some great doctors ive been told by some of the veterans the doctors are great when you can get to see them in many cases so we have a plan and its been put out on my website and people love it if youre going to have a wait of six days five days two days one day were going to give our great veterans the right to go out go across the street to a private doctor or a private hospital or a public hospital whatever happens to be in that community without having to drive  miles to another hospital and were going to give them the right to see their private doctor get taken care of it perhaps the private or public hospital get taken care of quickly effectively and go about their business and the government we are going to pay the bill that will totally reduce all of the waiting times all of the problems and i think it may actually get the va to respond better to things because you know there is a little competition you would think  but its not like we have a choice we cant let whats happening happen i mean ive heard stories that are so horrible i mean people are killing themselves while theyre waiting on line because they cant  you know they know its days and days before they can have what could be a simple procedure what could be a simple prescription they have to wait so long that they end up  they cant take it they cant take it so were going to establish a procedure where people can leave the line go outside take care of themselves and the governments gonna pay and by the way thats a far less expensive solution than other very foolish solutions ive heard the veterans love it they love it but its a far better solution than anything anybodys heard and its common sense and its there and the doctors need the business and the private hospitals and public hospitals need the business and theyre sitting there waiting so we dont have a choice we have to do that ok thank you     well were gonna get away from political correctness and were gonna have to do that and  like the whole concept of profiling you know i mentioned the other day profiling everyone goes profile and profiling well profiling is you know in israel theyre doing it and theyre doing it well and we may have to do that and we may have to do other things but youre right we have a politically correct military and its getting more and more politically correct every day and a lot of the great people in this room dont even understand how its possible to do that and thats through intelligence not through ignorance believe me because some of the things that theyre asking you to do and be politically correct about are ridiculous i will say i would leave many of the decisions of some of the things you mentioned to the generals the admirals the people on top and we get some of the  the congressmen just mentioned to me and i  i think its true  percent you get your top enlisted people in that and you have some discussions with some of these top enlisted people who know it better than probably anybody but we get our military people to come back and make recommendations to me and i will follow those recommendations i will follow them very strongly     any relation to ted cruz   and tom cruise   ok now you can take the question    well thank you thats a great question and have we ever had a time like this have we ever  has there ever been a thing like whats going on the other day just to add to your list i was watching one of the news programs and they had a  i think high school football coach you know theyre going into battle   is he here oh stand up wow  they really went after him   for saying a prayer before the  that is just  i didnt know youd be here   wow the world is changing isnt it so youre not allowed to pray before a football game i thought it was horrible i thought it was horrible so what did they do to you what happened sorry to take away from your question but its sort of an extension of your question what did they do   i think that is absolutely outrageous i think its outrageous  i think its very very sad and outrageous religious liberty hey its about religious liberty and there has to be a melding of both were living in a time where you have to have a melding of both but its very unfair what theyre doing to religion in this country and you know one of the things that im doing and im  we have the johnson amendment you know what that is that lyndon johnson in the s passed an amendment because supposedly he was having a hard time with a church in houston with a pastor and he passed an amendment saying basically if youre a pastor if youre a religious person you cannot get up and talk politics you cant really heres a prime example of it you know how strongly i feel about it  and i had  pastors ministers i had priests i had a couple of rabbis in a big conference room in one of my buildings and were talking and i could see they really liked me but i could also see they couldnt endorse me and i said just out of curiosity why well we cant do it because well lose our taxexempt status i said why is that in other words youre taking away your freedom of speech and they started telling me about the johnson amendment which really was the first time  and i started studying it and we had a meeting a month later and i said were gonna get rid of the johnson amendment because theyre stopping you and our great people from talking  and tony and all the people i mean these are the people we have to hear from and we wanna hear from them and you dont mind opposing views but theyre stopping you from speaking and actually your opposing views are able to speak because they dont have to worry about tax exempt status and things so i think its very unfair and one of the things i will do very early in my administration is to get rid of the johnson amendment so that our great pastors and ministers and rabbis and  and everybody  and priests and everybody can go and tell and can participate in the process i actually looked at  people in the room theyre strong people powerful people by personality and i said theyre really holding your voice back so you have these powerful people some were incredible speakers just a natural gift for speaking and i pointed down way down on the street on th avenue i said so those people walking along the street have more power than you do and i think thats very unfair you should be able to speak and i think that well go a long way to addressing the problem that you had but you have lost a lot of the  the  its amazing the church and religion has lost tremendous power and positive power this isnt negative power this is positive power by the fact that they are essentially prohibited from speaking because of the tremendous problem they have so one of the things im gonna do and i have tremendous support with the evangelicals and with the christians and with everybody is were going to get rid of the johnson amendment that is very very unfair ok    im very honored by that yeah they did it last week so thats the beginning of my process   thats on the assumption i win if i dont win you just wasted because thats never happening folks  youve wasted a lot of time and energy and money   why is your sermon on the way did they ask you for it   ok good but that is a terrible situation isnt it where they can say we dont like the way youre speaking about christianity about god we dont like what you just said and were gonna take away your tax exempt status which you know how important it is its very very  its a very sad thing   no thats what im talking about we wanna get their advice also believe me    yes i would look we need that so badly and when you  when you talk about the mental health problems when people come back from war and combat and they see things that maybe a lot of the folks in this room have seen many times over and youre strong and you can handle it but a lot of people cant handle it and they see horror stories they see events that you couldnt see in a movie nobody would believe it now we need a mental health help and medical and its one of the things that i think is least addressed and is one of the things that  like your question  one of the things that i hear the most about when i go around and talk to the veterans so were going to have a very very robust level of performance having to do with mental health we are losing so many great people that can be taken care of if they have proper care you know when you hear the  suicides a day its a big part of your question but when you hear the  suicides a day that should never be that should never be so were going to be addressing that very strongly and the whole mental health issue is going to be a very important issue when i take over and the va is going to be fixed in so many ways but thats going to be one of the ways were going to help and thats in many respects going to be the number one thing we have to do because i think its really been left behind ok thank you very much   thats true   kellyanne     i do want that i actually like that i think  i mean who else should i be listening to but the people in this room   i agree  percent general   well tony thank you very much and i will say this just as the general said im beholding to nobody ive spent you know tens and tens of millions of dollars on the campaign i am going to spending a lot more over the next month in addition weve raised a lot of money from small people that  people that give small donations people that wanna be a part of it and theyve been very much left behind we call them the forgotten man and woman and weve raised millions of  more than any republican ever thought possible and you know youve heard  million one month and  million and that these are in small  average donations approximately and weve very proud of that but the truth is i am beholden to no one nobodys gonna tell me what to do no  no group that owns a military firm that gives military supplies because i know  ive heard the case where often times you wanna buy certain weapons or something and you like one but you get the other one because that one has a contact to our politicians those days are over those days are over youre gonna get the best  youre gonna get the best equipment  youre gonna get whats good youre gonna get what the generals and what the admirals and what  and the enlisted and theyll  well get together we wanna get the right stuff but the truth is that the people in this room and your representatives all over this country the military people are so important to our country without you we wouldnt be here i dont think youve been given the respect that you deserve i dont think youve been allowed to fight isis as an example the way you wanted i dont think youve been allowed to fight for iraq the way youve wanted if they listen to the military people we probably wouldnt be having an isis right now i think i can say not probably i think we definitely wouldnt be having an isis right now but were running a war by politicians and were running a war by political correctness as per that question i can only tell you this and i used to speak about it all the time we have a navy that hasnt been in this position since world war i  we have an army that hasnt been in this position since world war ii in terms of levels and in terms of readiness and in terms of everything else we are not capable like we have to be this will be one of my most important elements when i talk cost cutting i do for so many different departments where the money is pouring and they dont even know what to do with it but when it comes to the military we have to enhance our military its depleted thats the word i tend to use its a depleted  we have a very depleted military we have great people we have a depleted military i told you about the jet fighters well its like that with so many other things so we are going to take care of our military were going to take care of our military  the people in our military the finest people we have we are going to take care of our law enforcement because in some ways thats going hand in hand now more and more when you see whats going on and the people that were allowing into our country we are allowing people into our country that are going to cause us tremendous problems this isnt a question of will it happen this a question of when where people coming into our country who are going to cause you and our law enforcement tremendous problems and therefore our society in the future because we have politicians that should be ashamed of themselves so i can only say this a very very important element of any country but our country and in my opinion the single most important thing that a president can do is the defense of our country i mean we can talk all of the elements we can talk about medicare and medicaid and social security we can talk about school we can talk about everything defense is number one or we dont have a country  our military and the strength of our military and the strengthening of our military is a number one priority for the trump administration and the worlds going to respect us again and they dont now a lot of that has to do with the leader and a lot of it has to do with leadership but our country is going to be respected again and we are going to make america great again thank you all very much"
81,"Trump","thank you  it is so great to be here in pueblo colorado we love pueblo  and those two gentlemen are amazing men and i want to thank them for being with us  you know pueblos called home of the heroes did you know that  because of your proud tradition of military service pueblos the home of four medal of honor recipients and i just got the endorsement of  all together   so when you have  thats pretty good but you have four which is amazing and as president eisenhower said there must be something in the water out here in pueblo because all of you guys turn out to be heroes whats going on whats going on is there something in the water give me some of that water colorado his home to six military bases were going to eliminate the defense sequester and rebuild our military were going to strengthen it were going to make it truly truly strong again  another great colorado legacy is hunting and fishing   my sons know that very well theyre here all the time were going to conserve your land for the future generations and were going to save your second amendment which is under siege  weve got a lot of people in this room this is very impressive thank you thank you its a great honor its a great honor one other issue of such great importance in colorado is energy crooked hillary clinton wants to shut down the mines and shut down shale and shut down oil and natural gas and were going to end the war on american energy and we are going to put the miners back to work they have to be put back to work  ive also made a centerpiece of my economic revitalization plan the largest middleclass tax cut since ronald reagan and the largest regulatory reform in american history were going to do that  and hillary clinton is going to increase your taxes very very substantially and she admits it  at least she admits it  but that because i know how overtaxed and overregulated the working people and companies in this country are a central issue i would like to address today is our broken tax code  an issue of concern to all americans along with securing our borders rebuilding our military keeping us safe from terrorism redoing our trade deals and bringing back jobs  and theyre sort of one in the same  fixing our broken tax code is one of the main reasons im running for president ive been saying from the beginning of this campaign how ridiculous complex and yes unfair the tax system is it is an unfair system and so complex that very few people understand it fortunately i understand it  this is not the fault of the irs but the political class that is owned outright by the special interests and lobbyists believe me its these politicians who wrote the tax code and who are constantly adding revising and changing an already overcomplicated set of laws all at the behest of their favorite donors and special interests who want certain provisions put in and they wont take no for an answer its thousands of pages long and almost no one understands it the average american would need an army of accountants and lawyers to wade through  and wade through it many socalled experts due to their sheer size and complexity of the code dont have a clue what these pages represent these are experts  they get payed and they dont even know what it represents the unfairness of the tax laws is unbelievable its something ive been talking about for a long time despite frankly being a big beneficiary of the laws but im working for you now im not working for trump  believe me  i understand the tax laws better than almost anyone which is why i am one who can truly fix them i understand it i get it and that is what i commit to do we want fairness we want money brought in and we want money to be spent when it goes out because they spend our tax dollars so unfairly and unwisely remember that as a businessman and real estate developer i have legally used the tax laws to my benefit and to the benefit of my company my investors and my employees i mean honestly i have brilliantly  i have brilliantly used those laws i have often said on the campaign trail that i have a fiduciary responsibility to pay no more tax than is legally required like anybody else or    put another way to pay as little tax as legally possible and i must tell you i hate the way they spend our tax dollars  and believe me that makes a difference as a major real estate developer in this country and throughout the world i face enormous taxes  city taxes state taxes sales taxes excise taxes employee taxes federal taxes vat taxes  different countries its my job to minimize the overall tax burden to the greatest extent possible which allows me to reinvest in neighborhoods in workers and build amazing properties which fuel tremendous growth in their communities and always help our great providers of jobs and we have to help our small businesses  what its all about its what its all about  the news media is now obsessed with an alleged tax filing from the s at the end of one of the most brutal economic downturns in our countrys history if you remember the early s other than i would say  there was nothing even close the conditions facing real estate developers in that early s period were almost as bad as the great depression of  and far worse than the great recession of   not even close what had been a booming economy in the year of ronald reagan changed dramatically and the business landscape changed with it bank failures and collapse the absolute total destruction of the savings and loan industry and the implosion of the retail market and real estate in general something weve never seen anything like it many businesspeople including many of my competitors and some of my friends were not able to survive companies jobs and opportunities were lost and lives were destroyed as tens of thousands of people were put out of work some of the biggest and strongest people and companies went absolutely bankrupt  which i never did by the way are you proud of me  i would have loved to use that card but i just didnt want to do it thank you yet today my company is bigger stronger far greater assets than its ever had before more premium properties weve never done better its the strongest weve ever been and we employ thousands of people and over the years have employed thousands and thousands of people which is a thing that frankly makes me most happy that did not happen by chance or luck it happened by action and talent  a lot of talent  i was able to use the tax laws of this country and my business acumen to dig out of the real estate mess  you would call it a depression  when few others were able to do what i did and those most    im a star thank you you are too  oh they were amazing times in those most difficult times when so many had their backs to the wall i reached within myself and delivered for my company my employees my family and the communities where my properties existed  and i really delivered those who spend their lives within the confines of government work and who know virtually nothing of business fail to understand the skill dedication the sheer grit it takes for a company to climb out of an economic depression of the scale we had in the early s  people like my opponent hillary clinton whose only      thank you darling    and im praying for you and i love you  great people now i get the whole hero thing now i get it  but that is why i have left private business to go into public life if you would have ever told me that i was going to be doing this  now had i known i was going to be doing this i would have commenced with certain television interviews radio interviews i would have said things slightly differently  and i wouldnt have had a good a time in life and as much fun in life but it would have made my life as a politician a little bit easier right  and you know these people  holier than thou they never say anything around the breakfast room table do they they never  they never do bill and hillary never say anything like this around the  can you imagine what they say well they talk about deplorables and irredeemables right  they talk about that youre deplorable youre irredeemable i think irredeemable might be worse if you think  everyone talks about  deplorable these are the greatest people in this room and many other rooms like it weve seen hundreds of thousands of people these are the greatest people  and really importantly were going to make it great for all of the people its not my people or people that are voting for me were going to make it great for all of our people in this country   but im doing this and im doing it for a very specific reason because i understand our country is in very very bad shape    thats all right sounds like a nice person  oh oh  i thought that was the commission on presidential debates that was working  i said i didnt know they were here  you know when they were playing with the mic  back forth  i thought that was the commission those  thats a beautiful commission lets see what happens on sunday again  my biggest opponent was the microphone and now our country is in need of a major comeback it needs one now just about more than ever we owe  trillion in debt doubled during obamas period as president  doubled think about it but thats only part of the story we have over  trillion in unfunded liabilities and we have a budget thats out of control with annual deficits in addition because of the incompetence of our leaders we run massive trade deficits on an annual basis ill get bernie to negotiate a couple of these trade deals youll find out and we now have almost  billion a year in trade deficits and you say to yourself who are these people negotiating our deals our country is broke its broke and the worst part is that with all of the money we spend so foolishly all over the world  stupidly all over the world  we protect other countries with tremendous  i mean tremendous losses and we want to protect countries but they should pay us the proper amount why should we be losing money  but think of it with all of the money that we spend and with  trillion in debt and all of the things we do and all of the talk and all of the political nonsense we have a decaying infrastructure we have failing schools we have rising crime we have a depleted military  our great people  and a depleted military we have planes that are so old they go to airplane graveyards to take out parts they go to museums to take out parts because they dont make the parts anymore we have an open border we have an economy that cant create fulltime highpaying jobs because our jobs  our great jobs  many of them have been  have been taken and we will build the wall dont worry were going to build the wall  were going to build the wall were going to build the wall were going to build the wall were going to build the wall mexicos going to pay for the wall they dont know it yet but theyre going to pay for the wall  and you have a tremendous problem right here but were going to have drugs stop pouring into our country destroying our youth poisoning our people  poisoning our people  were a divided nation and each week it seems were getting more and more divided with race riots on our streets on a monthly basis now somebody said dont call them race riots but thats what they are theyre race riots and its happening more and more you looked at charlotte  a great city where i have property a great city you look at different places our country  st louis ferguson baltimore chicago in chicago thousands of shootings  thousands since january st four thousand shootings think of it since january this is not the america that was handed down to us and its not the america that we want to leave to our children  and its certainly not the america we want to pass down to our grandchildren but this is the america we will have if we dont turn things around starting immediately we dont have much time folks we dont have much time and if we dont win this election it will never happen again this opportunity is never going to happen again what i say is not lost on the american people because  percent of you believe our country is headed in the wrong direction  and im trying to figure out who the other  percent are i want to meet them we cannot have another four years of barack obama and hillary clinton will be worse she will be worse  we can turn our country around but if we dont make a change in leadership right now itll never happen the failed political establishment must go it must go for the sake of your country your future and those you love the most  in the early s the splashed the front pages with stories about how donald trump  me  they said i was finished everybody said that i was done there were front page articles in the wall street journal and the new york times among many others they were thrilled and delighted and im still here can you believe these people they must be going  theyre going crazy  can you believe the wall street journal and the new york times they are going crazy they say  s  and now here i am still theyre saying can we ever get rid of this guy   but they were thrilled to write these negative stories so they said i was finished the only person who didnt think that i was in trouble was a guy named donald j trump i didnt think i was in trouble  i sort of didnt know what they were talking about does that make sense power of positive thinking but i didnt know what they were talking about i started my company with a small loan and as i grew i borrowed money to grow the company and  big money from big banks when the bottom fell out of the real estate market i had this large amount of debt and it stayed the same but the value of assets plummeted so you have to learn i was young and you have to learn and i learned and i worked really hard but i knew how to use the tax code to rebuild my company when others didnt i knew how to understand  and i fully understood the banks and the bankers and how to deal with them i knew a lot but my understanding of the tax code gave me a tremendous advantage over those who didnt have a clue about it including many of my competitors who lost everything they had never to be heard from again  never  they were never heard from again some people that i knew  they were good they were doing a good job  never ever to be heard from again now theyre gone and im here and im ready to turn things around for our country  im going to do it  the early s was a very tough time for the world but in tough times you need very tough and very smart people these are tough times for america and i will tell you we need very tough and very smart leadership  not people who tell you what you want to hear but people who tell you what you need to hear we must never allow corrupt career politicians like the clintons ever back into the white house again  these tough times were when i performed my very best the economy and banks they were collapsing the government was a mess but i enjoyed waking up every day to go to battle  and thats what it was for three years i had an expression in the early s survive until  and youll be okay and then people copied it  survive until  i enjoyed getting up every morning to take on the financial establishment on behalf of my company my employees my family and myself and win and thats what we did i won i won and i kept on winning until this day i kept on winning all you have to do is ask all of the  people that we competed against and youll ask them how did trump do theyll say he won  but thats the thinking we need for our country thats the thinking we need when were negotiating trade deals which are horrible and military deals and economic deals on behalf of the american people we need great people negotiating our deals for us we have the greatest negotiators and the greatest business people in the world and we use political hacks to negotiate our deals not anymore were not not anymore  put me into the board room as your representatives and i promise i will deliver hillary clinton is in it only for herself her donors and her special interests im fighting for america  many people  many people have said over the years that i perform better under pressure than anyone theyve ever seen ive proven that over and over again and thats what i do and thats what we have to do right now because our country is under tremendous pressure when the pressure is on when the odds are stacked against me and you because many of you people are the same way when people say it cant be done thats when we just get started were going to change things around  the thing that motivates me the most is when people tell me something is absolutely impossible for me impossible is just a starting point thats when you begin  and remember with  trillion in debt and  trillion in unfunded liabilities  a lot of people say its impossible were sitting on a big fat ugly bubble  our fed to raise interest rates because when those interest rates go you watch whats going to happen its going to be very unattractive hell be out playing golf someplace but you know what theyre wrong in what theyre doing and its unfair to the people its unfair to the country and theyre so wrong from the depths of that terrible real estate depression i created a company worth billions and billions of dollars and created tens of thousands of jobs our company  our employees  we  weve made  i mean we actually remade skylines together revitalized neighborhoods rejuvenated communities and hired thousands and thousands of workers on november th americas comeback begins and we need a comeback  and we are going to rise up from our present challenges bigger and better and stronger than ever before  a lot of people said why are you going to pueblo i said number one i like the state  number one everything about pueblo says winner including what dwight eisenhower said long ago  and they said well do you think theyll like you in pueblo i said i think so they said   they said well you have a lot of hispanicslatinos in pueblo and i said i think thats why they are going to like me actually thats why theyre going to like me  believe me when you look at whats happening with the african american community when you look at whats happening with hispanic community  very very unfair very very unfair thank you     and as americans youre entitled to the same protections as every other american gets everyone living lawfully inside our borders are entitled to the same things safe communities a great education and access to highpaying jobs and really good jobs and this isnt happening this is the change that i will deliver hillary clinton has been there for  years delivering nothing but talk and failure you know the other night when we were at the debate i noticed more than ever before  were at the debate and shes saying shes going to do this or this or this and that and i said to myself why hasnt she been doing it for  years right  just talk her policies have brought death and destruction overseas and poverty at home shes brought massive poverty for everyone but especially for african american and latino citizens she comes in tries to get their vote  although i must tell you the enthusiasm for her is very small don king the great boxing promoter who endorsed me said donald the african americans donald love you don king  big don and heres a man whether you like him or not thats a smart cookie a tough cookie and hes done a job  hes done a job but he said you are going to see a big surprise on november th with  and in this case he was talking about the african americans he said youre going to see a big surprise because so many african american people love you and they want you to really help them out in terms of the inner cities in particular where its so dangerous where education is so bad where jobs are nonexistent where youth cannot get jobs  so i want to thank don king and so many others for their endorsement we had so many others  so many reverends and pastors bishop jackson from detroit  incredible people darrell scott  pastor darrell scott so many and im so honored by it and believe me i am honored by it and don said that hillary clinton takes the african american vote for granted heres the bad news i dont think theyre going to want to go out and vote for her this is not barack obama where they really had spirit to vote for him nobody has spirit  remember she called african american males youth superpredators who wants to vote for her shes not going to do the job anyway she opposes school choice and she wants to trap african american and latino children into the failing government schools because shes getting a lot of money from the teachers unions so she doesnt want to have choice and she doesnt want to end common core so we can bring education locally which is very important she doesnt want to do that  were going to get poor minority   im telling you  im telling you the commission on presidential debates is operating this microphone  every time the secret service hears that sound they go woah no that commission on presidential debates  what a joke they are  ive got to go through them on sunday not again and by the way mike pence on tuesday night  he has been fantastic governor mike pence what a fantastic guy  tuesday night tuesday night we are going to get poor minority children out of failing schools and into the public private charter or magnet school of their choice  its going to be a big  ill tell you the latino children the african american children  its going to be some difference believe me  some difference hillary clinton supports obamacare and wants to expand it  and obamacare is an absolute disaster how much have they raised your premiums   double double how about triple quadruple its horrible and its going to die of its own weight but were going to  we are going to terminated it and we are going to replace it and it will be so much better and so much less expensive  premiums in colorado are set to go up another  percent the only way to stop this disaster is to vote for trump im telling you   theyll be going down hillary clinton also supports the terrible trade deals like bill clintons nafta and chinas entry into the world trade organization and next she wants to support trans pacific partnership  the deal she calls the gold standard    that she lied to during the debate she said she never called it the gold standard and lester holt kept questioning me on everything but he never questioned her on that right  and it turned out to be a lie she called it the gold standard and she will approve if she gets in but if she gets in you people have made one bad mistake i can tell you colorado has lost more than one in seven manufacturing jobs since nafta and china deals but while youve lost out hillary clinton has raked in cash from her contributors she and bill have made  million in speeches  and shes a bad speaker    to special interests they gave  speeches to big banks including  million in speaking fees from goldman sachs the clintons received another  million from a swiss bank after hillary negotiated a favorable settlement for them as secretary of state    to hide her corruption hillary clinton puts her emails on an illegal secret server open to foreign hacking then she deleted and bleached  emails after a congressional subpoena to hide them from the public   she lies to congress under oath and her ringleaders took the fifth amendment and got immunity deals explain that one  in so many ways its worse than watergate the investigation of hillary clinton was rigged and its a shame and its one of the saddest things that have ever taken place in our nation believe me whats gone on weve become a banana republic you know what we have now today we learned that the fbi made a side deal with clintons top aides to destroy their laptops did you know this let me repeat the fbi reportedly made a deal to destroy the laptops of government officials implicated in a massive criminal coverup  i think you have a lot of great people in the fbi  and you do indeed i think they are extremely upset at whats going on hillary clinton is the ringleader of a criminal enterprise that has corrupted our government at the highest levels and the american people have one chance to stop it by showing up and voting on november th  people have had it with the years and decades of clinton corruption this is the year the american people say enough is enough the clintons are the sordid past we are together as a movement  all of us  outside of this area all over the country  we are the bright future now another issue i want to address today finally immigration as i mentioned pueblo is filled with wonderful hardworking immigrants its these hardworking immigrants who stand to lose the most from our open border immigration policy illegal immigration and broken visa programs take jobs directly from latino and hispanic workers living here lawfully today  you know that theyre taking your jobs illegal immigration also brings with it massive crime and massive drugs including a terrible heroin problem right here in colorado  you have a big problem  so were going to build the border wall and we are not  what   were going to build the wall and were going to stop the drugs the gangs the violence from pouring in to colorado  weve got a lot of bad people that came in we have great people that came in but we have a lot of gang members we have a lot of drug lords we have a lot of drug sellers were going to ship them the hell out okay immediately  were going to shut down the sanctuary cities that have led to the preventable deaths of so many  cases like kate steinle murdered in san francisco by a fivetime deported illegal immigrant who should never ever have been here or cases like sarah root killed by an illegal immigrant released at the border by president obama and then released again after the killing there are over two million criminal aliens in this country and we are going to get them out and get them out fast  to the cartels the gangs the drug dealers i have a simple message for you your days are numbered and your reign of crime will soon come crashing to an end  but we also have to keep our country safe from terrorism the terrorists who planted the bombs in new york and new jersey and who carried out the mall stabbing in minnesota  you all saw that last week  were foreign nationals admitted into our country as was the mall shooter in washington or look at cases like the boston bombers here on asylum or the san bernardino shooter here on a fiance visa  fiance  nice visa  from saudi arabia killed  people that gave them a baby shower a short while before  and she killed them not only killed them but many many horribly wounded to this day or the orlando shooter the son of a taliban supporter from afghanistan terrorists are infiltrating our country now hillary clinton wants a  percent increase in syrian refugees and countless more refugees from across the middle east  i want to keep your families safe my job is not to represent foreign countries my job is to represent the citizens of the united states of america  putting your jobs your wages and your security first america first remember that america first youre living in the united states today as a lawful resident or a us citizen i will ensure you have a safe community rising wages and secure immigration system which is what we want  immigration security is national security  very important its national security here are some of the things we will do starting in  were going to lower your taxes substantially  shes going to raise your taxes were going to eliminate every unnecessary regulation  were going to repeal and replace jobkilling obamacare  we will make childcare affordable  were going to save your second amendment which is under siege  and i have the endorsement of the nra very early on great people were going to support the men and women of law enforcement  and were going to appoint justices to the supreme court of the united states who will uphold and defend our constitution  we are going to finally rebuild america we are going to revitalize america we are going to unite america were going to come together as a people  imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as one people under one god saluting one american flag    together we will make america wealthy again we will make america strong again we will make america safe again and we will make america  like your cap  we will make america great again thank you everybody god bless you god bless you thank you thank you"
82,"Trump","this is something  thank you wow  this is great wow thank you very much ladies and gentlemen thank you thank you very much i hope everybody way up on the hill  can you hear me up there can

really great so i want to thank everybody in  days were going to win this state and were going to win back the white house  so how many of you watched the vice presidential debate last night  mike pence did an incredible job and im getting a lot of credit because thats really my first socalled choice that was my first hire as we would say in las vegas  and ill tell you hes a good one he was phenomenal he was cool he was smart he was  i mean you just take a look at him he was meant to be doing what hes doing and we are very very proud of governor mike pence  thank you mike pence   mike had the single most decisive victory in the history of vice presidential debates i believe that  and last night america also got to look firsthand at my judgment and that was judgment you know you need judgment for people for deals we dont do deals like the iran deal we dont do deals like that anymore folks we dont do deals like that   billion in cash and were in las vegas when you hear  billion i think this whole state would be filled up to the roof  whoever heard of things like whats going on unbelievable well mike laid out big and bold solutions for america his opponent talked only of small and petty distractions hillary clinton has been there for  years and hasnt fixed anything  she goes around  well do this well do that well do this  all these things its all wonderful the problem is why didnt she do them in fact shes just made things worse she failed in upstate new york as a senator promising to create  in order to get elected   jobs but manufacturing is down more than  percent and the jobs have left its just the opposite she failed overseas producing only death and destruction she unleashed isis destabilized iraq syria libya and put iran on to the path of nuclear weapons in less than  years now they will have nuclear weapons one of the dumbest deals ever made whether its countries or any kind of a deal you can think of one of the dumbest deals ever made at home hillary clinton failed latinos and africanamericans producing only more poverty in the inner cities and you see that you see that all  wherever you go to the inner cities nothing happens it never happens its called give me your vote and then they dont come back four years later they come back shes merely the vessel for the global special interests bleeding our country dry they are bleeding our country im running to represent americans and we are going to make america rich again were not rich were a debtor nation right now  im going to end illegal immigration  stop the massive inflow of refugees keep jobs from pouring out of our country renegotiate our totally disastrous trade deals and massively reduce taxes and regulations on our workers and our businesses  my economic agenda will be very very simple its called jobs jobs jobs  our jobs are all leaving the problems we face as a country are immense and its going to take bold action to turn things around we need change we need change right now we owe  trillion debt  trillion dollars it doubled under president obama  our infrastructure is like that of a third world country the homicide rate last year experienced the biggest single year increase in more than  years does anybody know that biggest increase in homicide in  years our police are underfunded understaffed and undersupported and hillary clinton basically accuses our police of all being racists  our border is wide open and drugs and criminal cartels are pouring into our country on an hourly basis  thousands of refugees are being admitted with no way to screen them and are instantly made eligible for welfare and free healthcare even as our own veterans our great great veterans die while theyre waiting online for medical care that they desperately need  our veterans will be taken care of like theyve never been taken care of before  do we have some veterans in the group stand up stand up veterans  wow  we have such tremendous support from the veterans group from law enforcement veterans groups from all over the country we just had the endorsement from the fraternal order of police which represents massive amounts of police almost every police group almost every veteran group and then i saw today  i left the room and i saw a commercial where it was really a nasty commercial totally made up about me with vets theres nobody that loves the vets more or respects the vets more theyre spending hundreds of millions of dollars on false commercials and its a disgrace so what well do i guess well sue them lets sue them right lets sue them its unbelievable  they say lets see wheres trump doing well hes doing well with the vets oh lets do a commercial on the vets and whatevers unpopular theyll just put it in let me tell you were going to take care of our vets like youve never been taken care of before remember that  our annual trade deficit with the world is nearly listen to this  billion a year you say whos negotiating our deals right we have political hacks negotiating our deals and we have the greatest business people in the world in our country why arent we using them  billion a year in trade the federal budget is a total disaster our state department mostly under the watch of crooked hillary clinton misplaced or lost  billion can you imagine this they lost it you know you lose a couple of bucks they lost  billion in taxpayer funds  we have the worst socalled recovery by far since the great depression were a nation totally divided with race riots in the streets our college students graduate loaded with debt only to discover they cant find jobs or certainly not the jobs they want or not the jobs they were trained for and worked so hard to get those jobs have left our allies arent paying their fair share foreign countries like russia and china do not respect us do you ever see hillary clinton when she wants to talk tough about putin they say donald trump loves putin  i dont love i dont hate well see how it works well see maybe well have a good relationship maybe well have a horrible relationship maybe well have a relationship right in the middle i can say this if we got along with russia and russia went out with us and knocked the hell out of isis thats ok with me folks thats ok with me  so our taxpayers and us all of us as citizens are sending troops and foreign aid all over the world even as their own cities cant provide the most basic services we go to some of these middle eastern locations and well build a school and they blow it up and we build it again and they blow it up but when we want a school here or in brooklyn new york or in los angeles or someplace else we dont have the funds weve spent  trillion in the middle east think of that we could have rebuilt our country twice if we knew what the hell we were doing and were not respected at all  america needs a turnaround america needs a comeback america needs a change and thats why im running  thank you on november th were going to show the whole world that america is back bigger and better and stronger than ever ever ever before stronger than ever before  first were going to repeal and replace the disaster known as obamacare  president obama said if you like your doctor you can keep your doctor that was a lie he promised his plan would reduce premiums by  per person that was a lie instead they surged to much more than  and you know it because youre all here youre all witnesses now it happens yesterday right bill clinton yesterday theyre so angry at him they scolded him yesterday he was scolded did everybody hear what happened yesterday   and this is what ive been saying for years so bill clinton torched president obamas signature legislation  remember hillary clinton called obamacare one of the greatest accomplishments of president obama of the democratic party and of our country itself right but bill had a different view he said its just a crazy system  and thats the way he said it its the craziest thing in the whole world then he went on to say well people out there are busting it true theyre working like hell theyre busting it sometimes  hours a week and wind up with their premiums doubled and their coverage cut in half this is bill clinton the people are getting killed he said in this deal and small business people and individuals who make just a bit too much money to get these subsidies you know what happens they dont get anything they get nothing clinton added it doesnt make any sense the insurance model just doesnt work  so you know theyre always telling me oh if you say something just apologize just apologize i think that president obama should apologize for obamacare  and i think that hillary clinton should apologize for pursuing obamacare and she wants to make it even worse than it is right now were going to repeal it and were going to replace it with much less expensive and much better care  now this is essential for your great state and my great state because obamacare the majority of the counties in your state have only one insurer to choose from did you read that this morning in your good paper good paper owned by a great guy sheldon sheldon sheldon adelson and a great supporter of israel sheldon adelson  great supporter theres only one way to stop obamacare vote for donald j trump very simple very simple  very simple  its a very simple way to do it you got to get out there november th i say kiddingly but i mean it i dont care how sick you are  i dont care if you just came back from the doctor and he gave you the worst possible prognosis meaning its over you wont be around in two weeks doesnt matter hang out until november th get out and vote and then all were going to say is we love you and we will remember you always get out and vote  and dont let the other sides take this election away from us because this is the last chance we get and i see elvis back there elvis this is the last chance we get the deadline to register to vote is october th in your state so you can do that early this way you do not have to wait around until november th if you are the person seeing the doctor right no we have all great healthy people you have to be healthy because obamacare doesnt work so you have to have  you really have no choice thats the only thing good about obamacare is you have to maintain your health which is good psychologically to think that way because obamacare will not be there it is a disaster early voting begins on the nd fixing our trade deals will be the foundation of our economic revival china japan and europe are printing huge sums of money the devaluation of currencies is staggering as to what it represents to our country our businesses our citizens and our jobs every time we start making progress china devalues its currency and we go right back to the drawing board because you cant compete against that its cheating we are not going to level playing field and our politicians do not understand what is going on they really do not get it and the ones that do get it are taken care of with political contributions so they close their eyes  were going to do something much different and i am spending my own money on my campaign ill tell you im spending a fortune  one of the very big pundits very respected actually very liberal said you know what youve done has never been done before and it makes no difference if you win or lose this movement will go down in history i said no you dont understand i like to agree with you but if i dont win this will be the greatest waste of time money and energy in my lifetime by a factor of  because if we dont win we cant change things we cant bring back common sense we cant strengthen our military which is so depleted we cant save our nd amendment so many different things so we have to win we have to win our jobs are being lost    in massive numbers and were not making things relatively speaking in america anymore too much is being made in other countries when im president we will start making things in america again  our nation has lost onethird of its manufacturing jobs since bill clinton signed nafta you know it was clinton that signed it a lot of people dont know that one of the worst trade deals in the history of the world the deal was also supported very strongly by hillary clinton hillarys korea deal south korea cost us another  jobs remember that it was supposed to be a good deal it cost us jobs tremendous numbers of jobs and south korea like almost every other country is laughing at how stupid we are since china entered the world trade organization another bill and hillary backed deal  factories when i saw  i said please go back it cant be possible cant be possible i figured maybe    factories have shut down or left the united states can you believe this  thats  factories closing a day on average we are living through the greatest job theft in the history of the world our jobs are being stolen by countries with much smarter leadership than ours not going to happen anymore folks not going to happen anymore  as the factories leave our money leaves with them stores close schools suffer the tax base erodes wages fall and the quality of life totally declines real cash wages for many workers today are lower than they were in  i usually say  years but it goes back much further people think of this people are working harder today they have sometimes two or three jobs than they were ill just say with  this is  eighteen years so they made more money  years ago let me tell you theyre younger they are less experienced today they work harder theyre older and they make less money now the only thing that i can say to make you feel better is im also older and im also working the hardest ive ever worked in my life doing this this is the hardest ive ever worked in my life  its true thats true this is work although its like love but its work but were getting there were gonna make america great again its gonna be worth it ok  we rebuild other countries at the expense of our own skyscrapers going up in beijing while plants and factories crumble in the united states companies like carrier general electric motorola mattel fiatchrysler and so many others  i could go by the hundreds  are moving their jobs to mexico and other countries and now ford has announced two weeks ago its moving all of its small car production to mexico on top of the massive plant that they announced three years ago thats going to cost  billion thats now complete and then you wonder why were doing well in michigan and ohio because ive been saying this for five years i havent been saying this for the last two weeks like hillary who doesnt know whats happening ive been saying this for five years and the people of michigan know that and the people of ohio know that and thats why were way up in ohio and thats why were doing so well in michigan a state that normally a republican wouldnt do that well in but theyre losing all their jobs to mexico and other places were going to  well you ready for this one folks were going to renegotiate nafta    and if we dont get the deal we want we will withdraw from nafta and start all over again making better deals for our workers its going to be america first its america first no more like lets take care of everybody else except ourselves    were also going to stand up to foreign currency manipulation and apply tariffs and taxes to the countries that cheat that way we neutralize that way our businesses can compete and we wont lose our jobs  we will also stop the transpacific partnership the deal she called the gold standard hillary clinton said and then during the debate she lied and she said i never said that and then they actually factchecked her and they said trump was right finally im right finally  every time i made a statement this character challenged me she can say whatever she wants say are you going to check that statement so they check the statement she called it the gold standard let me tell you tpp will be almost as bad as nafta nothings like nafta but itll take your jobs our of your state itll take them out of ohio and michigan and pennsylvania  tpp is a disaster and they dont cover currency manipulation because our politicians didnt want to put the necessary language into the documents and the documents are over  pages long and nobody from our country practically has even read that dont let it happen and if i win forget it  and were gonna have trade but instead of having trade deals with all of these different countries thats so complicated well do trade one on one one one one one one and if they dont treat us right we send them a letter of default and by the time letter of default and now you cant do that because youve got to go through this looks like a jigsaw puzzle the backers of the tpp have donated heavily to hillary clinton and their wish is her command shes an insider fighting only for herself and for her donors im an outsider fighting for you thats what im doing this fall  we will stop the foreign cheating the product dumping and the one sided trade deals this stuff will not happen anymore folks were not going to have a country left well lower taxes on american businesses from  percent to  percent and many small businesses will file as individuals and pay only  percent a massive tax cut  on top of that we will have the largest regulatory reform in american history our regulations are a disaster theyre putting businesses out of business our tax trade energy and regulatory reforms will help us reach  percent growth and create at least  million new jobs within a decade america will become the great jobs magnet of the world  and i will the greatest jobs president that god ever created ill tell you that that will happen  that will happen factories will come rushing in our schools and communities will be revitalized and our poorer citizens will get new jobs and higher pay and new hope for their life  but to be a rich nation we must also be a secure nation security begins at the border you understand  any government that does not protect its own people is a government unworthy and unfit to lead  countless americans who have died in recent years would be alive today if not for the open border policies of hillary clinton and barack obama  this includes incredible americans like  years sarah root unbelievable person the man who killed arrived at the border entered federal custody and then was released immediately into the us community under the immigration policies of obama  clinton  he was released again and again after crime and now hes at large sarah graduated from college with a  grade point index number one in her class the day before she was viciously killed  also among the victims of the obama  clinton open border policies was grant ronnebeck a  year old convenience store clerk from mesa arizona he was murdered by an illegal immigrant gang member previously convicted of burglary who had also been released from federal custody then theres the case of  year old earl olander  who was brutally beaten and left to bleed to death in his home the perpetrators were illegal immigrants with criminal records a mile long but who did not meet the obama administrations priority for removal in california a yearold air force veteran marilyn farris  was sexually assaulted and beaten to death with a hammer her killer had been arrested on multiple occasions but for whatever reason was never deported also in california my good friend great guy jamiel shaw lost his amazing son at age  he was viciously shot and killed by an illegal immigrant for no reason whatsoever the killer had three gun charges as well as battery of police officers prior to the shooting but he had not been deported they just did not want to do it id like to invite up to the stage now some of the families from the incredible remembrance project who are here today and these are amazing amazing people  theyve lost their loved ones for no reason     mike come out here mike come out here mike how about  do you want to say something on behalf of your boy      thank you      amazing and in story after story and its  this is just a small group of the people but i tell them every time im with them i say your loved ones will not have died in vain you know what i mean  incredible people the remembrance i will tell you its incredible people its a tough thing to go through there are more than  million criminal aliens with criminal convictions in the country right now and more who have committed crimes you would not believe it but who have escaped the law entirely when i am president we are getting them out of our country and were getting them out immediately quickly fast  and a lot of the countries from where they came wont take them back they dont want them back theyre killers theyre this theyre that we dont want them back and under hillary clintons state department she said  oh they wont take them back huh under a trump administration i promise you every single one of them will be taken back gladly gladly ok gladly they dont want to take them back so theyre on our streets killing people all americans living lovely  in this country including millions of wonderful patriotic hardworking immigrants are entitled to have their jobs and wages and their security totally protected the borders around our nation are for the benefit of all people living here today  everybody and those borders are erased  its often done by the lawful immigrants already here and if you look at whats going on with the borders and very simply if they are erased and if we have no borders we really have no country and thats really whats happened and i have to tell you ive been endorsed by the border patrol agents  by ice two days ago  ice first time theyve ever endorsed anybody for president i was endorsed by sheriff joe sheriff joe knows the border he knows the border we love sheriff joe at the same time our country is being infiltrated by terrorists just two days ago an immigrant from bangladesh in yet another isis plot hundreds of immigrants from highrisk regions have been implicated in terrorism inside the united states since  the terrorists who planted the bombs in new york and new jersey last week and who carried out the mall stabbing in minnesota two weeks ago were foreign nationals admitted into our country as was the mall shooter in washington state no more folks no more now the media doesnt want to talk about this they really dont just like they dont want to show the crowd just like they dont want to show the crowd  the never want to show the crowd  never ever  did you ever go home and you watch and you hear this roar it sounds like youre at ohio state football game  so you know theres thousands and thousands we were yesterday in arizona we had a line that was a mile and a half long trying to get in its incredible we were in colorado the day before we had a line  you wouldnt believe the stadiums we fill up the arenas that we fill up and they never take the camera off my face never people say how was the crowd i say didnt you see oh i loved your speech but didnt you see the crowd no i heard but they never ever show the crowd and thats for good reason they dont want to show the crowds because nobodys ever had crowds like this and its not me its you this is a movement like never before remember that   and believe me the media which is totally dishonest is a big big part of the problem that our country is having  these are really dishonest people you watch the clinton news network cnn its a joke its actually a joke  its a joke and i think most people are starting to understand it the good news their ratings are bing the boston bombers were here on asylum the san bernardino shooter was here through a fiance visa sounds so nice doesnt it a fiance visa oh coming in to get married from saudi arabia right came in probably radicalized him went out killed  people that shortly before gave them a party honoring their new child shot them killed them many wounded the orlando shooter was the son of a taliban supporter from afghanistan im going to keep the terrorists out of our country  not going to have them  hillary clinton wants a  percent increase in syrian refugees  shes for open borders remember this im not running to be president of the world im running to be president of the united states and were all going to protect each other  and we are going to make i say it again and ill say it again and again we are going to make america first again remember that america first were going to make america first  were going to build the wall and were going to enforce our laws and were going to keep our people safe i have a simple message for the cartels the gang members the drug dealers preying on our citizens destroying our youth your days are numbered your reign of crime will very soon come crashing to a very ugly end youre getting the hell out of this country  were also going to end government corruption hillary clinton put her emails on an illegal secret server open to foreign hackers  then she bleached and deleted  emails after getting a congressional subpoena you cant even do that in a private case she lied to congress under oath and her staffers took the fifth amendment and got immunity deals  now weve learned that the fbi made a side deal with clintons top aides that it was ok for them to destroy their laptops do you believe this  hillary clinton is the ringleader of a criminal enterprise and the only way to deliver justice is to mail in your ballots go out there get them done november th get in were also  were going to end this folks were going to end it we cant

people have been shot in the city of chicago obamas hometown since the beginning of the year thats since january not a long time homicides are up nearly  percent in washington dc and more than  percent in baltimore the democrats like hillary clinton have run the inner cities for    even  years unbroken theyve produced only more joblessness failing schools and rising crime to those

low income africanamerican and latino child in this country  i want to put every american child on the ladder to success that means a great education and a highpaying job that you love here is some of the more amazing things were going to do for our country starting in  were going to have the biggest tax cut since ronald reagan and maybe even bigger than that looks like  were going to eliminate every unnecessary regulation which is choking our businesses and killing our jobs she wants to raise your taxes and she wants far more regulation were going to end education were going to end common core  were bringing our education local were going to repeal and replace obamacare  bill clintons said we have to do it so well have to listen to him oh hes suffering now and all he did is tell the truth were going to make childcare affordable were going to save our nd amendment which is under siege  we are going to support the men and women of law enforcement  were going to rebuild our very depleted military and we are going to take care of our great veterans  we are going to appoint justices to the united states supreme court who will uphold and defend the constitution of the united states  this election day you have one magnificent chance to deliver justice for every forgotten man woman and child in this country on november th the arrogance of washington dc will come face to face with the righteous verdict of the american voter  the failed and corrupt political establishment will be replaced with a new government of by and for the people  i am going to fight for every last citizen in this land and im going to fight to bring us all together as americans imagine what our country could accomplish if we stated working together as one people under one god saluting one

come up and we used to have meetings with people and they kept talking about heroin heroin heroin i tell the story all over new hampshire because its so different than these beautiful little valleys and the trees and the lakes and the beautiful roads that we just rode over and you talk about heroin and it doesnt work it just sort of  it doesnt seem right but its a tremendous problem here and its a tremendous problem all over the country and were going to close up that border were going to build a wall you know we got the ice endorsement just yesterday ice great people  and we got the border patrol endorsement and the border patrol agents endorsed  and sheriff joe endorsed us  sheriff joe  tough sheriff joe is tough and good but getting ice yesterday was a tremendous thing for us so i just want to make a quick remark and then well start with howie and i know its very hot in here and we want to keep this small and by the way they were saying this is practice this sunday this is isnt practice this has nothing to do with sunday were are just here because we just wanted to be here and you know hillary frankly they talk about debate prep its not debate prep shes resting shes resting  and i want to be with the american people i want to be with the people from new hampshire and she wants to rest  debate prep tonight well discuss many issues of great importance to new hampshire and few states in america have been hurt worse by the trade policies of my opponent and you know that nafta has been a disaster signed by her husband and youve lost nearly one in three jobs think of it i mean think of it one in three jobs since nafta and china made deals we made deals with china world trade organizations what a disaster that was supported by hillary clinton but the nafta deal signed by her husband although he did a great thing two days ago when he was willing to say how bad obamacare was that was crazy  that was pretty good the open border policies and i just wrote this out but i feel its so important the open border policies of hillary clinton including catch and release another terrible practice have allowed a massive influx of drugs into new hampshire and frankly into states all over our country  almost every state and its really fueled the tremendous heroin and drug crisis that we have were going to close up those borders folks believe me and i promise that to you in new hampshire more than anything else i said and i talk about it no matter where i go when i mentioned this state because it was really the first glimpse i got of how serious a problem we have theyre poisoning our youth theyre poisoning more than our youth theyre poisoning everybody but they are poisoning our youth its tough enough out there our youth that doesnt have a chance with whats happening and were not going to let it happen anymore and were going to help the people that are so badly addicted were going to help them  so im going to bring your jobs back  jobs are leaving like youve never seen before record levels im going to stop the drugs from coming in im going to create school choice and were going to get rid of common core which is a disaster  and were going to create something very special for every disadvantaged child in this country of which we have far too many we are going to repeal and replace obamacare   which bill admitted this week is a crazy system could you believe that hey at least hes honest boy has he suffered can you imagine  can you imagine that has he suffered but he said its a crazy system that doesnt make sense and doesnt work and where people end up with premiums doubled and coverage cut in half i couldnt have said it better myself ive been saying it  hey ive been saying it for two years longer i know im going to put him on the campaign oh im sure  do you think anybody has called him and said lets recheck he did a minor retraction but you can see he was unhappy about it remember jonathan gruber do we remember the name i dont ever forget jonathan gruber the architect of the bill admitted it was sold on lies remember that he thought he was talking to his friend unfortunately hes friend turned out not to be such a good friend because his friend had a little cell phone  those cell phones are brutal just like emails are brutal unless you want to delete them all  unless you delete about   but jonathan gruber the architect of obamacare admitted it was sold on lies and talked about the stupidity of the american voter right remember that the stupidity of the american voter the only stupidity was that the politicians who ignored the american people and forced this thing absolutely forced it down their throats and hillary clinton wants to double down she wants to make it even worse i mean thats ultimately whats going to happen and me youve seen what were going to do in a much much better health care at a much lower price and people are going to be very happy extremely happy and were going to take care of those that are disadvantaged and cant afford to do what others can afford to do but youre going to be spending  and were going to take care of them better than theyre being taken care of now but youre going to have health care that works youre going to have health care where companies compete to get your business and theyll come up with plans that you havent even seen or thought about right now it will be a beautiful thing to see and im sure well be talking about it on sunday night during the debate because theres no way well lose this issue its a disaster obamacare is a disaster  were going to create a more honest government our government is a disaster how about the  billion in cash that was given to iran cash remember it was going to be  million turned out to be  billion in cash you know what that is thats more than this room you would put it probably in hundreds although it was all different currencies from different nationalities maybe they didnt want american dollars  they said anybody so stupid to make a deal like this we dont want their money but can you imagine this these people they never saw anything like it and by the way thats not going to fight terror they got plenty of money that theyll use thats going to their swiss bank accounts ok just in case you had any questions all right anyway we gave it to them and boy did we give it to them so i want to let you know that we are going to be a country thats going to be run properly and im going to be  by the time this finishes ill be in for tremendous amounts of money tremendous amounts of money that i fund myself we also have a lot of wonderful people in terms of small donations and thats coming in fantastically we have some people that just feel very good about our country under proper leadership but were spending a lot of money and were doing it ourselves and were very proud of it were going to be very proud of our country and when people call up to ask for certain favors that are bad for the country but good for them  the nice part i dont even have to take their phone call i dont need them i dont have to take their phone call  before we go any further i want to send our thoughts and hearts with all of the people and prayers to the millions in the path of whats now known as hurricane matthew it looks like its a big one and its going to be a bad one it looks like hopefully it takes that right turn but it looks like its going the opposite direction not good its one of the strongest storms to hit in many decades and our neighbors in florida georgia and the carolinas are in a direct path it seems southeast florida is taking the brunt we have a lot of friends in florida a lot of buildings a lot of investments in florida a lot of great employees in florida southeast florida is taking the brunt of the storm to all of my friends in florida please know we are praying for you and everyone in the path you got to take care of yourself youve got to get out of the area youve got to listen you have a great governor governor scott and you got to listen because it could be a really really bad one so its going to be a rough couple of days and maybe beyond that but well see what the path ultimately is weve seen the damage throughout the caribbean and cuba the bahamas haiti and others in fact they say in haiti almost  people  they think around  have already been killed by this terrible storm so to the folks in haiti and all over were going to be helping you well be with you and we send our best wishes and prayers we have a tremendous problem that i think is brewing right now as we speak here so well know in about four or five hours i just spoke to rick scott and governor christie just spoke to rick scott and it looks like four or five hours away so well know but whatever happens were with everybody because it looks like its going to be a very bad one maybe the worst in a long period of time ok with that howie carr has been amazing hes been very  i dont know if hes allowed support but he sounds like he supports me a lot  im not sure if hes allowed to  im not sure hes allowed to but i think probably but he certainly been amazing and hes a very talented guy and hes a terrific guy with a terrific family so when we came up and a lot of people wanted us to do this we said lets get howie so howie lets got you have some questions   ok   ill tell you what ill make a you a deal if im doing well dont call me if im answering the question poorly please call me immediately in fact you can go   you could go in  seconds you could do it all right   all right   ok got it   where is matthew   hi matthew   yeah i did hold back i thought it was just inappropriate to say what i was really thinking i would say and i held back i think for good reason  i think for good reason id much rather have it be on policy and i didnt like getting into the gutter and so i did hold back i also i mean honestly this was you know the commission the socalled commission on presidential debates give me a break did you see where they came from one of them comes from the hillary camp the head person   well this microphone is wonderful  but i had a problem with the mic we had a guy inside the room oscillating my mic was it that the mic didnt work and you know its interesting i went there a little bit before and i said boy the mic the is so great unfortunately when i went to talk they turn the mic up and down and you saw it  everybody in the room saw it so we had a real problem and the head of the debate said youre right it was a serious problem  told this to mayor giuliani it was a serious problem after the debate an hour and a half he said and now that the debate is over im going backstage to find out what was wrong and i said great that helped  but i felt that  i really felt that i wanted to keep it on as higher level as possible lets see what happens i mean lets see what happens i think were all better off if we can do that because it is about issues it is about policies    good   wow do we have about  hours to talk about this look weve had failures at every level weve had failures  i think the iran deal is one of the worst deals ive ever seen ok its going to lead to nuclear weapons i was with bibi netanyahu the other day and we talked and we talked about it and not to reveal what he said but i will tell you i can tell you what i said this is horrible for israel its horrible for our country its a horrible deal because over a period of time over a short period of time it leads to  within  years theres going to be some of them  then theyre going to end up with nuclear weapons and they have like a path on top of it we gave them back  billion we obviously paid ransom for our hostages obviously and obama said this had nothing to do  well why did they delay it until all this money came in but most importantly its just a bad deal and im all for this because i happen to think that nuclear is just about the biggest problem that we have in the world today i think its one of  you know obama thinks its global warming i think it is nuclear in the hands of the wrong players this is devastating there is no winner theres never going to be a winner with nuclear believe me and so i think deals are fine but they have to be good deals the deal made by secretary kerry  never left the table  he just agreed agreed agreed hed want something then says no and hed agree so sad but there is one example of a just horrible horrible thing we should never have gone into iraq  we should have never gone into iraq but of equal importance or most equal importance is the way we got out obama took us out with hillary clinton create this incredible vacuum isis was formed a lot of different problems happened and totally destabilized you know the surge whether you are in favor of going in or not the surge really did work then all of a sudden boom and not only that we announced always were leaving here were leaving them how about mosul did you see mosul where they announced yesterday  im seeing all about were going to attack mosul  were going to attack mosul i mean why do they say that now a lot of the bad hombres are in mosul the leaders of isis  they think but theyre not there anymore because they say hey wait a minute theyre going to attack lets go someplace else  isnt there an element of surprise remember when we were young and we were studying history and they would talk about some of the great generals and great attacks and was called the element of surprise wouldnt it be nice if we attacked first and talked about our great victory later now you know seriously whos going to  its almost like theyre wasting their time attacking mosul because everyone that we want is going to be gone youre going to have all civilians and therell be tremendous death and carnage but the people that we want theyre going to say hey  which are the leaders  get the hell out of here its a very very sad thing we are being run by people that are incompetent i will tell you that    charlene hi   how are you   well first of all thank you very much and i appreciate it interestingly i was listening the other day there was a gentleman who owns a big radio station hispanics mostly  all hispanic callers and he was arguing with one of the hosts he said no you dont understand the people that are calling in hispanics they love trump theyre all for trump and he said i was even surprised but now im for trump also you know i mean this is happening more and more i just got back from las vegas where we gave a tremendous  i mean we had a tremendous crowd of people a lot of hispanics  latinos they like to be called in that area you know that right hispanics and latinos but we had tremendous response and just tremendous  it was an outpouring of love and you know people that are here legally they dont want people coming across the border illegally taking their jobs taking their homes taking whatever they want to take and we want people to come in now i want people to come in to our country so bad but they have to come in legally you know we have a country and we have laws we have a border and if you dont have a border you dont have a country but i think the biggest surprise two big surprises  were going to do great with africanamerican you look at whats happening with inner cities its a disgrace and the democrats have been running them for up to  years unbroken and the africanamericans believe me i think were doing  and you see how the numbers are changing one thing they dont have a lot of confidence in hillary clinton shes lied to them for years she doesnt produce she just doesnt produce but i think were going to do great with the africanamericans you look at the poverty in the inner cities you look at the crime in the inner cities you look at the education  and there are no jobs  and we are going to do fantastic with the hispanics i believe that    were keeping it down right   hi karen thank you thank you i like this audience i like this audience   well look the way i look at it the middleclass has been forgotten in this country taxes are too high jobs have been taken away from you a lot of our companies  a lot of great companies have left our country they have gone to mexico and other places china is making so much of our product we dont make any product anymore anywhere near like we used to and i will tell you such a great question because our middleclass has been treated so badly by the politicians i mean just like forgotten and we are lowering taxes as you know way down for the middle class were changing the tax structure completely we had seven brackets now we have three and we are bringing it down actually for those making not a lot at zero and we dont want them to send in because thats huge bureaucratically and extremely costly but we are bringing the rates down to numbers that are much lower you have seen the numbers much lower and youre going to have a much lower tax base hillary clinton is raising your taxes way up i dont even know what shes thinking we are already the highest taxed nation in the world just about they can maybe find every once a while theyll fact check me well now theres a nation that you never heard of we are slightly higher  we are just about of the industrialized nations were the highest taxpayers in the world were the highest taxed nation in the world our business taxes are going to be brought from  percent to  percent were cutting regulations which are  we want regulation for environmental we want regulation for safety but the regulations are massive howie their massive and were cutting the regulations at a tremendous clip and i would say  percent of the regulations can go its just stopping businesses from growing and i think youre going to see a tremendous change in this country were going to see jobs come back were going to see companies come back into our country and right now theyre just leaving its a oneway street out we have a oneway street right out of the country and they are going largely to mexico and other places but mexico is the eighth wonder of the world i tell this story a lot i have a friend who builds plants and he builds these massive plants and he says donald you have to see whats going on in mexico i said how about our country he goes not so much were going to switch that around a little bit and well get along great with mexico by the way but weve got to switch that around its been a oneway highway out of the united states   well thats the biggest problem and that takes place with so many and even though its over  degrees in this room i dont feel it but you know this room was not meant for this many people you do know that right i heard the other night i was making a speech and we had tremendous massive crowds and it was really hot so im a little warm and there mightve been a little bit of sweat and one of these dishonest people said donald trump was sweating and i said sweating it was  degrees  and guess what were all sweating tonight also right but thats ok thats good thats healthy the biggest problem you have is people got to college i mean thats great getting out now thats fantastic that means real smart but people go to college they borrow money theyre up to here theyre up to their neck in debt and then they get out and they cant get a job i mean its such a massive problem they cant get a job because our really good jobs are gone and theyve gone to other countries and so many other countries are making our product i want to see the day when you can get those great marks and that incredible profession which you love probably or you wouldnt have been so high up in the class right at the top but i want to see the day when we can have those jobs back in this country at the highest level i want to see the day when apple will make their iphones in this country instead of making them in china in vietnam and all over the place ok   and believe me if im president thats going to happen and i use apple as an example but in all fairness apple makes all this products all over the place theyre not making them here mostly in china now vietnam which is becoming very strong for this theyre going to start making them here theyre going to start making them here we have the most people we have the most unbelievable people if i learned one thing in going around we started on june th of last year and ive gotten to know the people and we have by far the biggest rallies that people have seen far bigger than bernie and he was second  but far bigger not that bernies arent so big by the way  theyre very small bernie made a big mistake by the way bernie sanders would have been legendary if he didnt make a deal with the devil when he made that deal his stock went way down it went way down i mean honestly even as somebody that is you know disagrees with him on a lot of things other than trade we agree very much on trade very very much on trade except i will do things about it because i like free trade but i want to make a great deal in free trade but he was right on trade because our country is being ripped off of jobs and everything but were going to have a country that makes product again were going to have a country that apple and these other great companies are going to make their product in our country and were going to have lots of people working including yourself we have to do that ok thank you    hi bob   well i guess well be talking about this for a while to come but i have to tell you its one of the saddest things ive ever seen happen to our country whats happened with hillary clinton where you send emails where they send a subpoena and they want all of your emails i mean if youre in private business and you do what she did it is called the  ok the united states congress  congress sends a subpoena wanting emails and she gets the subpoena and she deletes  emails and many other things including lying all over the place and you see people who have suffered greatly including general petraeus for doing a tiny fraction of what she did thats only  we cant stay here all night and talk about it but the lies she told to congress  the lies she told to the people  but the lie she told to congress and then you see the fbi give her a no tape no anything no swearing in i believe they said no swearing  you dont have to even swear in and they questioned her on the th of july and then they released their finding on labor day right before labor day when everyone is gone theyre gone here theyre gone there i think whats happened with respect to because i have such respect for the people in the fbi and i have such incredible respect for the fbi whats happened to the fbi and to the justice department at the highest level honestly i think its one of the saddest things ive ever seen in this country whether we like it or dont like it to look at whats happened and to look at the way thats been handled and you know every time i speak this is mentioned as subject and the people are going crazy the people of this country are very very angry  very very angry and i would think i dont know this but i would think that some of these great fbi agents and the people that work within the fbi i would imagine they are just furious as to what has happened to the reputation of the fbi so i mean i think it is an amazing question honestly its like we are a third world country it is one of the saddest things that i have ever seen happen in this country and it happened to justice and thats probably i guess the way you feel also yes it is very sad   i just am very disappointed i mean you know when he read the charges and hes going one two three four and im saying wow theyre going to do the right thing and then he goes essentially however it was i mean it was amazing  it was amazing to go after point after point and that was only a few of them so it is very disappointing its very disappointing   well you know we dont have too many howie ill be honest with you you know the press likes to report we have some of these longterm people that have done such a bad job look at the problem our country is in i would never use these people and they know that so then they announce in a group that theyre going over to hillary right you understand and they announce in the group but you know we have tremendous support including a couple of your very distinguished folks from new hampshire who were against me who are now for me and you are allowed to announce their names but we have tremendous support in new hampshire one of them was very tough and very smart go ahead   thats true ive watched him and i said boy hes tough   oh thats good well thats good because im  i mean i thought it was terrific i met him the other day and  father and son  and i think theyre great people but he was tough i tell you what he was really hunting for trump and you know what i respect for somebody that can go other way its not that easy to pivot as you would say but i very much appreciate the sununu family and the fact that they are with me and i am with them and theyre going to do very well hes going to do very well and i see the numbers and you know one of the things that have really happened they all thought oh trump  because look ive never done this but ive done very well in my life and business and did a lot of good things but ive never done this saw all of the reports well youll take down the senator and youll take down this senator you know how well the republicans are doing i guess there is a gentleman in illinois thats not doing so well this guy was actually taking out ads against me i said are you sure hes a republican maybe hes a democrat and hes not doing well but hey thats his problem i mean you know he was not for me but if you look at  and that was for political reasons  but if you look at what is going on now theyre all talking about  in fact the other day i saw very interestingly one of the announcer you know donald trump is having a very positive effect on these races the republicans are going to hold theyre doing terrifically well far better than anyone thought and frankly we are winning states and were going to win some states that would never in a million years  you know this be in play i mean we have some states like were doing great in colorado and somebody else wouldnt do well nobody else would do well were doing great i think were leading colorado in one of the polls as you know just came out were leading colorado i just left were leading a lot of places and were doing at least very competitively in a lot of states that absolutely would not be for republicans and you know one of the funny things they do the maps and remember to  ive watched the different people that do the maps and theyre very small path its tougher for the republicans i have to tell you but they said theres very small path but i was watching the other day and the same person was saying wow this path is getting a lot wider doesnt mean they were happy about it but the path now there are four different paths before there was one little one   well nate silver has been you know he didnt predict us in the primary and he had never called a loser before i mean you know hes always been on the right side of what happened in terms of at least his predictions and he didnt predict me in the primaries and in all fairness you know hes never seen me never spoke to me never saw what we did you know we had  very talented people and one by one by one it was a beautiful sight to watch wasnt it beautiful and by the way howie those people most of them endorse me ben carson chris christie so many of them endorse me and they are great endorsements scott walker has been incredible   he helped pence too mike pence by the way has been fantastic and he did a great job last night   he did a great job last night   thank you lois   john harwood was the worst moderator out of all the debates we had how many did we have  or  he was so bad this guy knows nothing about me i was so happy  and i saw it today that somebody on cnn the clinton news network who knows nothing about us you know they used john king actually hes a nice guy i like him on the maps he does a good job with the maps i like them better now than i did a couple months ago because a couple of months ago i had no chance now all of a sudden that map is getting very red but john king said  you know they always have a source they always have a source a source with  nobody talks to him nobody talks because he is like the enemy hes like the enemy but he said and a few other people said donald trump was at first happy and then he was unhappy because mike pence did so well i said unhappy were jumping up and down he was so good  and i tell you what hes a great human being you cant root against him you cant  i was telling chris christie i said can you imagine these people are saying that i would have loved to you know see him not do well because that makes me look better these people that is why a guy like john king has stayed in the same position for like how long has been at cnn i used to say i think someday hell be an anchor guess what he is still doing the maps but no i was so happy i mean i can give you my word on this i was so happy that mike did well and i was rooting him on we were talking all during the day and i was giving him some ideas and we were running things by each other and its so disconcerting when you  even tonight they said donald trump is going to new hampshire to practice for sunday this has nothing to do with sunday its like they make you like a child i love the people of new hampshire this was set up a little while ago they were going to cancel it and i said why are you going to cancel it well you want a debate prep i said forget debate prep i mean give me a break do you really think that hillary clinton is debate prepping for three or four days hillary clintons is resting ok shes resting she wants to build up her energy for sunday night and you know what thats fine but the narrative is so foolish im here for one reason i love the people of new hampshire i said i was going to be here and im here very simple    thats trouble   always go into what you love doing and you may have parents that are trying to push you one way or another but you know what you love you have to do what you love and i say this all the time i say it in speeches and everything i mean i will speak in front of young people because i love doing it and i say always follow your dream always go into what you love and never ever quit or give up ive seen a lot of people over the years big people and not so big usually its not so big because if they quit theyre not going to get so big but the most successful people ive ever met are the people that never quit they never give up they just dont take no for an answer so do something that you really love doing because that is not work and never ever quit or give up do one or two more howie  thank you   hello al    well the veterans as al can tell you and there are a lot of veterans in this room because i recognize some of you and ive become very close to the vets and a lot of it started with new hampshire to be honest and iowa but i really got close to the vets and ill tell you what in many cases theyre living in hell what is going on with the veterans administration between the corruption the long long waits  suicides a day i thought that was a typo when i heard  suicides a day i said thats impossible twentytwo suicides a day much of it caused by the fact that they cant get to see doctors howie they wait in line for five and six days and at the end of the six day the doctor says sorry you know im going on vacation and actually the veterans administration and the vets tell me this they have some really great doctors but getting to see them is sometimes almost impossible we are going to solve finally the problem of the veterans administration we have illegal immigrants that in many cases are treated better than our great veterans and you know that and everybody knows that theyre being treated better than our veterans and thats not going to happen one of the things were going to do is the lines are impossible getting to see a doctor is in many cases just days and days when that circumstance happens were going to let our veterans go across the street around the corner two miles away and see a doctor private or a hospital public or private where they are looking for work where they have wonderful people and theyre looking for work take care of their problem and we will pay the bill and thats going to be the cheapest thing we can do its going to be the cheapest thing we can do  and al can tell you a lot of the vets that i recognize in the room they can tell you everybody is in love with the plan and were going to keep the va but  were going to keep the veterans administration were going to keep the hospitals were going to keep the buildings because i think thats important you know we have to take care of our vets these are people that we wouldnt be here if it werent for the vets but when theyre waiting in line and they know there is no end in sight and honestly theyre dying they need a simple procedure they need a prescription they need something very easy and they end up dying and its a very sad thing so theyre going to be able to go across the street to a public or private hospital to a doctor and were going to take care of our vets for the first time were really going to take care of our vets ok    well let me tell you youve heard that and most people didnt even believe it but thats true and you know shes open border she wants people to just flow through  look when the border patrol agents  and when ice when they come up  and theyve never endorsed a presidential candidate before but these are great people that want to do their jobs you know its much harder for them to do their jobs to just stand back right now its stand back and let them in its much and catch and release which is a disaster but when they want to do their jobs and its much more difficult and they come out and endorse trump whos going to have them do their jobs and were going to build the wall and were going to stop things from coming in look were going to stop  and this was the pledge i made to new hampshire more than any other place because this is where i really couldnt believe it but i said if i win and i become president first got the nomination  that happened  become president i promise the people of new hampshire that we are going to stop this crap from coming into your state  percent  percent and it can be done and it can be done even before the wall goes up the wall is a necessary edge you know i asked the patrol i asked really the ice folks that endorsed me and i asked the border patrol folks that endorsed me i said how important is the wall and you know im so committed to the wall i was pretty sure they were going to say this but i wasnt  percent they said mr trump it is absolutely necessary for us to do our proper job which made me you know gave me a little additional security as far as the wall is concerned we need the wall we have to stop the drugs heroine but mainly drugs but we have to stop the drugs from pouring into our country and believe me it is poisoning our country and its poisoning our youth and were going to stop it and were going to stop it fast long before the wall gets up were going to start that wall fast i get them built fast but i tell you long before were going to stop that poison from flowing into our country ok one more well do another question   she gets easy once   do you ever notice by the way did you see the difference im getting boom boom boom with here what would you do to fix the economy well of course thats actually a much tougher question than you would understand and she doesnt have a clue but you see the questions i was getting    lets have a fun question   thank you thank you i think just the relationship i had with my parents you know my father built houses in brooklyn and queens and the apartments and he was a very good negotiator id sit at his knee and it wasnt that he taught me he didnt really say son you have to learn but hed be on the telephone negotiating with a plumber or an electrician or a sheet rocker and i would hear this and id be playing with blocks at his knee on the floor and id be listening and it was always so vivid and he was always negotiating and you know what thats what we need in this country because people are running away with our country you look at whats going on whether its the border whether its our depleted military  the greatest people on earth are military people but they have old equipment you saw the piece they did on many of the networks where they show fighter jets with their  years old theyre so old that they dont make the parts anymore these are fighter jets that our people are flying now and they have to go into plane graveyards they have to go into graveyards to get parts and they have to go into museums to get parts because they dont make the parts anymore now we need a strong military we need to protect our second amendment we need to take care of our vets we need borders we need great education getting rid of common core so important we need so many things and by the way one thing and i know john sununu and a lot of other people felt this was so important when they came out so strongly united states supreme court we need  we lost a great justice justice scalia great justice  we need great justices who are going to uphold our constitution and if hillary clinton gets in youre going to have a much different country so so many people feel thats so important i personally feel its one of the most important things defense always being we have to defend our country and we have to stop people coming in from parts of the world where theyre looking to do us harm believe me and theyre pouring in and hillary clinton wants to have them come in at a rate of  percent more than president obama were going to stop it and you know the statement we are going to make america great again and it is going to happen quickly  so thank you very much everybody thank you   the world series you know look of is course its boston"
84,"Trump","thank you thank you thank you and we love big ben big bens a friend  we play golf together he once hit a shot that went head  right into a tree it was a massive tree like this the ball hit the tree so hard i swear i said ben within two years thats trees going to be dead and you know what two years later hes shooting the same its because we have  here  but two years later that tree was dead  he is a strong guy and hes good guy too big ben  so im thrilled to be back in pennsylvania great place i went to school in pennsylvania november th were going to win this state and were going to win back the white house  were going to take on the special interests the corrupt media  and it is corrupt  and the career politicians that have stolen your jobs your wealth and stolen our middle class theyve stolen our middle class were going to make pennsylvania rich again by bringing back our jobs well bring back our jobs  and hillary clinton doesnt have a clue about how to bring back jobs that i can tell you  she doesnt have a clue if she wanted to she couldnt do it you know in new york state she ran for the senate and you know what the state new york is a disaster for jobs and she said im going to bring back  jobs guess what right down the tubes worse today than ever before how many have watched the debate last night  good  we had a lot of fun and i would say that hillary is highly overrated  it was fun watching  i mean most of us  unanimous decisions but some of these people they were so pain  it was like a painful experience but were fighting for you so whats good for me is good for you and i mean that totally  percent  and were going to talk about a lot of things today but i always want you to remember this above all else were going to bring back the jobs to pennsylvania were going to bring back steel your steel has been stolen from you in this area  natural gas the epa is killing you and killing your companies and youre losing your jobs let me tell you thats going to turned around on day one if i win on day one your jobs are coming back to pennsylvania and theyre coming back to this area and that means were going to take care of our steel workers and were going to take care of our miners believe me im going to take care of you  we laid out a goal uplifting vision for america lower taxes better trade deals  ill give you a purse   and millions and millions of new jobs but all crooked hillary can do was talk about small petty things last night during the course of  minutes she was exposed and her values were exposed she had no defense all she could do was lie she lied so much last night they dont like to catch her on the lies i explained how hillary clinton oversaw the disasters in libya including the drawing of the infamous red line remember she said oh i had nothing  well it turned out she was there by the way remember she said she wasnt there  the red line was actually drawn in august of  no she was there she lied about it she said she wasnt involved in that catastrophe but that was just one of many of course the moderators didnt call her out and they didnt call out this lie that she told hillary clinton said she didnt delete her emails after a congressional subpoena but she did that was another lie that was a hard one to believe how did she say no to that one the subpoena  well the subpoena was sent on march   crooked hillarys emails were bleached and destroyed now nobody bleaches them you know what bleaching is so expensive its really a very expensive process but when you bleach them it pretty much means theyre gone although ive always heard you cant get rid of emails ive been told you cant i wonder if the nsa has her emails do you think   do you think i dont think they looked too hard for her emails what do you think folks do you think  i dont know   ill tell you i bet  i dont know this for a fact but ill bet within the fbi  you know you have some of the greatest americans in the world that are so proud of the fbi  and ill bet you they are sick to their stomachs at whats happening sick to their stomachs  anyway her emails were destroyed somewhere between march th and march st after the congressional subpoena was received you know if you are suing somebody privately and they delete and get rid of all your stuff that you subpoena you got a very big consequence you know what the consequence is right heres  heres the united states congress  united states congress subpoenaing to see emails and other things and theyre gone and now by the way did you read yesterday two boxes of emails and materials are now missing   very very sad special prosecutor here we come right  if i win were going to appoint a special prosecutor because we cannot allow this to happen to our country we cant were like a third world nation hillary had no defense for her contract  and didnt even try to defend the ridiculous  that these were  emails about yoga and wedding planning  lets see you have    emails deleted right i would bet she had three for yoga and maybe five for the wedding right what about the rest she had no defense when i brought up her failures in iraq syria and libya she had no defense when i brought up her failures as a senator from new york promising to create the  jobs for upstate new york but instead the jobs were shipped to mexico and other countries she had no defense for calling on millions of americans and then saying that they were deplorable  thats you deplorable thats me its all of us and you know whats worse irredeemable i dont know which is worse would you rather be deplorable irredeemable means you have no chance right were deplorable and irredeemable i dont think so i think we have the greatest people on earth the smartest people  we have the smartest we have the most loyal people thats one thing every poll points out that boy trumps people its like the most loyal ever  and one thing i know were going to get out and vote and were going to be voting and you remember the primaries donald trump is behind voting begins tomorrow should be very interesting but it looks like mr trump will not be able to win this state but hes put up a good fight next day donald trump wins by  points everyone  crazy deal mr brexit mr brexit remember i said brexits going to happen because i have a lot of property over there brexits going to happen they all laughed they said donald trump said that brexits going to happen isnt he ridiculous anyway three days later they vote brexit happens they never say anything they never said anything  but thats all right this is like brexit folks you watch we want our independence back we want our borders strong we dont want people coming in from syria that we have no idea who the hell they are  as i said last night  and i mean this  shes got hatred in her heart she wants to divide america i want to bring us together as one people  and by the way we have thousands and thousands of people outside you know that right do you know how lucky you are do you know how lucky you are  and i guess theyre not allowing them in i dont know why because theres thousands of people where is the fire marshal let some more people come in i see some seats over there let some people  fire marshal we need your help  wheres our fire marshal let them come in weve got  or  people standing out there see i guess they figure you folks are taking the seats in the very back we ought to let some more people come in  i always get a kick  i mean i know a lot about fire and fire marshals but you have a room with four walls and a roof and nothing to burn let the people in  hillary also had no defense for obamacare which is a total disaster im going to repeal and replace your disastrous obamacare much cheaper much better  hillary had no defense for her secret speeches to wall street and international banks that she hid from the public and which were exposed by wikileaks and by the way just as im walking on the stage mayor giuliani said youre not going to believe this look at this we have all of these new charges you see it just came down today wikileaks some new stuff some brutal stuff i mean id read it to you but to hell with it just trust me its real bad stuff  the speech transcripts contain scandalous revelations about hillary clinton that disqualify her from seeking public office  and she is shes disqualified just on the fact that she did that with her emails think of it deleting   think of it how can you do it these transcripts also shine a spotlight on how this corrupt establishment works where politicians meet in secret with the big banks collect massive sums of money then betray the american worker which is you and me and sort of all of us were all workers were all working we just work differently you know i tell this to people we have people in this room right now that made more money  years ago than theyre making now they work a lot harder right now than they did  years ago their job was better  years ago and theyre older and the only thing i say is im older also and ive never worked this hard either folks i will tell you thats for sure  my campaign is powered by my money and also small donations from millions of visitors to our website who just want their country back they want america back  last night i asked hillary clinton why she doesnt take some of the hundreds of millions of dollars that she made   so ill over  million into the campaign of my money is that smart or is that stupid   take some of the money she made selling favors to special interest and invest them in her campaign instead of having to rely on even more corporate donations she looked like oh my god why did he bring this up she had no answer she was flabbergasted i can tell you in the secret speeches released by wikileaks this is yesterday and the day before hillary  not as good as today buy the way  hillary clinton  but i say that because the press will try not to pick them up because they try and protect her ill tell you what the only thing shes got going in the media without the media she would not have a chance  hillary clinton told her wall street donors that you need to have a public position and a private position in other words you need to be dishonest to run for office in other words have one for the public and one for the people that are giving you the money right and that is very much right in that whole thing i mean its crazy how did hillary clinton try to defend this shocking admission she did not deny  she said this awful thing instead she blamed honest abe incon  honest abe  so hillary clinton for lying blamed abe lincoln commonly known as honest abe hes spinning in his grave the speeches also show that crooked hillary supports cutting medicare and social security benefits one more example of how hillary clintons public position is a lie she wants to knock the hell out of your social security she wants to knock the hell out of your medicaremedicaid and im going to save them ok this is a little reversal for the democratrepublican but i am going to save them  because were going to make  were going to make our country rich again were going to bring back our jobs were going to make good trade deals  were going to have countries that we are defending all over the world pay a little bit more money if that is ok  which in all fairness until i came along you never even heard about that right and then when i say that they say oh trump does not want to defend japan no id love to defend but let them pay a little more money right isnt that good were dying  were going to have  trillion in debt  trillion so some of these countries that we do such a good job for where we defend them  and we love doing it but they got to help us out a little bit right most shockingly these speeches show hillary clinton saying quote my dream is a hemispheric common market with open trade  you know what that does to your community thats the end and open borders  in other words she wants the united states to surrender to global governance  with no controls over trade or immigration great can you imagine seriously can you imagine shes saying shes for nafta which she was you know her husband signed nafta but shes also for transpacific partnership by the way nafta is the worst trade deal ever made in the history  not of this country but of the world what its done to pennsylvania and ohio and update new york and new england poor new england what its done to new england so shes for radical unlimited immigration in other words people are going to pour in  but thats what shes for im building a wall and shes for like come on across slight difference  a slight difference were going to build a wall who is going to pay for the wall   by the way they may not know it yet but i think theyre getting the idea but when you think of it she wants to have people pour across now the border patrol agents  endorsed me recently and last week  never endorsed a presidential candidate before in long history and last week ice endorsed ice is  these are great people these are people that want to do their jobs but theyre told to stand back dont do your job these are great people you know itd be a lot easier for them if they didnt endorse me because they could just take it nice and easy but they want  so we got ice we have the border patrol agents we have sheriff joe from arizona we love sheriff  and hillary clintons got nothing so she wants people to pour across the borders she wants thousands and thousands of people to come in from syria i mean  percent more than our president obama  a trump administration will completely renegotiate nafta or we will walk away and make a brandnew deal thats far better where actually businesses start coming to pennsylvania and to ohio  unbelievable and we will stop the disastrous transpacific partnership which would be almost as bad as nafta nothing could be as bad but well stop it and well make deals but this is a complex deal with many countries you have to see the arrows all over the place once you sign it its  pages more than that long once you sign it its a mess i like free trade we make one deal two deals three  we make it with individual countries and if they dont behave we terminate them we send them whats called a notification of termination  but that will never happen because during that day period well renegotiate a better deal for our country ok and you the other way you cant terminate theres too many  its  people go crazy you have to be like a grand chessmaster and we dont have any of them hillary clintons radical call for open borders meaning anyone in the world can enter the united states without any limit at all would end the united states as we know it today  no one who supports open borders should be able to run for president because we wont have a country  and by the way weeks ago i called out hillary clinton for supporting open borders and the media said i was wrong now ive been proven right where is the media rushing to correct these false stories because in the wikileaks it was all about open borders free trade for everybody see i like free trade but we want smart trade its got to be  it shouldnt even be called free trade it should be called smart trade i dont like the term free trade  because free trade to have it really work you need really really smart people negotiating your details and all these other countries have smart people for them its important for us we have people they dont know what theyre doing  no less than bernie sanders declared that open borders would be the end of america bernie sanders said open borders means there would be no united states doing away with the concept of nationstate sanders also explained how open borders would make everybody in america poorer by radically reducing wages maybe thats ok with him not ok with me by the way how many ways can hillary clinton betray bernie sanders she really has betrayed him i mean look even if we dont agree with him i mean  you know bernie sanders would have been a legend he would have gone down as a legendary figure in history if he didnt make the deal with the devil but he made the deal with her and now hes just another guy  she attacked his supporters as basement dwellers she admitted in secret shes in favor of entitlement cuts and shes for open borders and open trade your state has lost one in three manufacturing jobs since bill and hillary clintons nafta and china deals happened im going to stop foreign cheating the product dumping which by the way is killing your steel industry and in this case has already killed much of your steel industry how many people agree with me that china  because this is such a big steel area or was  were gonna bring it back dont worry about it but how many people agree with me that china had so much to do and stupid politicians with the killing of the steel industry in the state of pennsylvania  between that and currency manipulation which they do like grand masters and we do like were playing bad games of checkers were going to start making things in america again and were going to start making things in pennsylvania again dont let them tell you youre doing well because youre doing lousy  pennsylvania steel will build our future and pennsylvania energy  our miners were bringing our miners back  will power our future  congressman get up there will you do we know our congressman look at this guy i tell you they say he was a hell of a  football player they say he was  i dont know if hed be so good today would you be good today i dont know but he has been such an incredible supporter and so great and hes standing next to my daughter tiffany who came today  thank you congressman thank you we have such great support in these areas that includes though clean coal shale oil and natural gas we have to protect pennsylvania workers will be hired to do the job hillary clinton would rather give your jobs to people that pour into the country illegally i explained how she favors a  percent increase in syrian refugees coming into our land we have nothing  we know nothing about them and by the way we all have hearts we know whats going on its horrible when you look at syria when you look at the migration well build safe zones and well get others to pay like the gulf states they have nothing but money and theyre not putting up their fair share they have nothing but money theyll pay and well lead it but theyll pay  i also exposed how hillary clinton is personally responsible for the release of thousands of dangerous criminal aliens into the united states as secretary of state hillary clinton refused to make foreign countries take back their own criminal aliens by canceling visas a duty vested in her by the law and i must tell you she refused to use forceful diplomatic action so well have a killer and hell be from another country lets say someplace in south america and well catch him because our ice people are great and our border patrol people are amazing so well catch him and what happens is well want to bring him back to whatever country that person comes from this could be a killer a drug dealer somebody else a gang member the head of a gang hillary clinton would say we cant force him back into that country the hell we cant  i guarantee you that under my administration there will not be one bad guy that is not forced back into his country not one there wont be any you wont be reading about it we will put such pressure on those countries to take these people back but hillary clinton did say  im sorry madam secretary if you can believe this this was prior to her naps  im sorry madam secretary but they wont take this killer back oh thats ok well bring him back and let him out on our streets and you know what happens right the remembrance project you know what that is right the remembrance  these are the most incredible mothers and fathers and sisters and brothers who have lost their loved ones to killers to killers illegal immigrants that killed their loved ones and its a sad thing to see that i can tell you her refusal to take such diplomatic action has caused the release of thousands of criminals into our community one foreign national and convicted killer who should have been sent back to his home country in  was instead set free by clintons watch six months after his release he killed again murdering a year old beautiful casey chadwick you probably heard about it in just one single year of hillary clintons tenure  nearly  convicted criminal aliens were released into american communities because their home countries just said no were not taking them back were not taking them back yes were supposed to legally were not doing it so we took them another revelation from those secret speeches is that hillary clinton knew that the state department and their devices were under threat of hacking and yet she traveled overseas with her totally insecure telephone remember the ones that she banged the hell out of when she wanted to get get rid of   no i wasnt trying to  who banged their phones when you throw your cell phones does anybody bang them with a hammer this is still more evidence that she lied to the fbi just like she lied to congress and she lied to us one more very important issue where i exposed the hypocrisy of hillary clinton and the media was on hillary clintons treatment of women i was getting beaten up for  hours on all the networks for inappropriate words  years ago locker room talk whatever you want to call it but i said to myself wait a minute and i just saw a very inappropriate words but bill clinton sexually assaulted innocent women and hillary clinton attacked those women viciously one of them said more viciously than he attacked them if they want to release more tapes saying inappropriate things well continue to talk about bill and hillary clinton doing inappropriate things there are so many of them folks you probably saw yesterday we brought four wonderful women to st louis  and honestly it was both very beautiful and very sad they really  theyve been trying to get their feelings out for so long and the media wouldnt take it one thing with me the media takes it whatever so they were able to get what they wanted to get out to quote juanita broaddrick hillary clinton threatened me after bill clinton raped me shes been struggling to get the media to pay attention to her for many many years so last night i decided we would expose the hypocrisy of the clintons and the media and our politicians to the entire world  as i outlined last night bill clinton was the worst abuser of women ever to sit in the oval office he was a predator hillary clinton systematically attacked and discredited the victims of bill clintons sexual harassment and assault these things arent written by the media but theyre true written by many books these victims include names like kathleen willey juanita broaddrick paula jones connie hamzy eileen wellstone sandra allen james and cristy zercher and there are many many more for decades hillary clinton has been deeply familiar with her husbands predatory behavior and instead of trying to stop it she made it possible for him to take advantage of even more women she put even more women in harms way and then she goes out and says i love women im going to help women im gonna help women shes a total hypocrite the hypocrisy of the media and our politicians is hard to believe they condemn my words but they ignore and defend the  and this is the way it is  the reprehensible actions of hillary and bill clinton that have destroyed and hurt so many lives but perhaps the greatest window into the character of hillary clinton can be found in what she did as a lawyer when she was defending a man who raped a yearold little girl  desperate to win her case hillary clinton blamed the yearold victim her name was kathleen shelton she was with us yesterday she was right sitting front row at the debate as the lawyer for the rapist hillary clinton said the little girl was emotionally unstable and had a quote tendency to seek out older men and engage in fantasizing this is  hillary ruined that little girls life destroyed her life then years later she was recorded laughing about it on videotape she was laughing at the girl theres nothing hillary clinton wont do or say to obtain power and its about time people started to understand that  but the hypocrites in the media dont want to talk about what hillary clinton has done to these victims they dont want to talk about what their other political heroes have done to other innocent girls and women people like kennedy chappaquiddick we remember that driving his car into a pond instead of calling the police possibly saving her life in fact almost definitely being able to save her life he went home and went to sleep did not report the incident to the police for  hours yet he was hailed as a hero  the last  hours has framed what this election is all about its about the american people fighting back against corrupt politicians who dont care about anything except staying in power and keeping their donors happy  what i want to say to every american right now is that i accept the mantle of this responsibility for all of us for all of us  we have an absolute incredible situation taking place folks and i will never stop fighting for you against the washington establishment that has betrayed each and every one of you betrayed the country our government has lost its virtue right now its just about protecting the powerful and you know what i mean and i know it better than anybody else and im doing this because i just think its so damn unfair  and its ultimately going to lead to the destruction of our country and were doing it the clintons have corrupted our government at the very highest levels rank and file  incredible people by the way incredible people  rank and file fbi agents are shocked at the corruption that theyre witnessing at levels of the fbi that nobody would have thought it was possible the department of justice where bill clinton gets into the back of an airplane for  minutes just prior to a determination being made of course you and i know the determination was made a long time ago but gets on with the attorney general because he happened to be in arizona playing gold it was  degrees out right nobody saw him on the golf course just happened to be there oh theres the attorney general let me get back on the plane so they spend  minutes in the back of the plane they talked about two things golf and grandchildren thirtynine minutes so i give the grandchildren five minutes i give the golf three minutes right what else do you think might have been talked about they cant believe these fbi people these people for life in the fbi  these are people that are unbelievable people they love this country so much and theyre seeing things that theyve never seen before where guilty guilty guilty guilty no charge no problem they see all of this stuff going on and these people much be sick to their stomachs what have we seen in the email scandal what have we seen in thirdworldlevel corruption this is really what it is its thirdworld  were like in a thirdworld country right now and this november is our one chance november th our

stronger so much safer so much wealthier we have to do all of those things a woman came up to me and said mr trump please sir leave out wealthy it doesnt sound good i said can i use rich instead rich

choice we want to save our social security and our medicare and our medicaid we want to save our wealth we want to keep our taxes as low as possible right now theyre far too high our taxes are going to be cut massively by me if i get in and hillarys going to raise taxes  our regulations which are killing our companies are going to be cut massively by me and ill tell you what you look at your energy companies your natural gas your coal companies your steel companies they cant do business they cant compete with the rest of the world because the regulations are so horrible and so massive so were going to cut taxes hillarys going to raise taxes were going to cut taxes big league for the middle class big league for business were going to grow again companies arent going to be leaving our shores theyre not going to be leaving us for mexico and other places were going to have companies coming back and new companies being formed its going to happen very quickly  my whole life ive been a fighter and now im going to fight for you were going to fight  were going to bring back our military you know our military needs enhancement its so depleted were going to fight for our veterans who are being horribly mistreated not taken care of properly in many cases illegal immigrants are being taken care of much better than our veterans  were going to fight for our second amendment which is under siege  were going to take care of that one easily were going to fight to have supreme court justices that believe in our constitution appointed to the supreme court  were going to fight for all of our businesses but were going to fight for the steel businesses that have been taken away from us were going to fight from those  for those miners whose jobs have been  you know when i was in west virginia i met incredible people and a lot of miners and i said to them did you ever think of maybe moving to another area and going into another profession   they said mr trump  just like she goes hell no  but just like  its just like that they say mr trump we love being miners we love mining our grandparents did it our great parents  grandparents did it our fathers we love mining and i realized the love that they had for mining and as you remember weeks before hillary clinton made a statement someplace else before going to west virginia and trying to get their vote if you can believe this she said we are going to close the mines and were going to put the miners out of work then she went to west virginia and she tried to convince them well she didnt mean it let me tell you folks were going to take care of our mines were going to take care of our miners were going to have clean coal clean coal were going to have them but were going to bring back our   and were going to protect a great new resource something that really over the last fairly short period of time from an energy standpoint has become so important and something so important to this area natural gas so we are going to keep our people working and were going to have a lot more people working we are going to get rid of obamacare we are going to get rid of common core were going to bring our education local  we are going to make great and lasting trade deals not the horrible trade deals this year on trade we will have almost an  billion trade deficit think of it who negotiates these deals whos negotiating in other words countrywide with china were going to lose almost  billion but think of this countrywide we do all this work were going to have a trade deficit of  almost billion its not going to happen anymore folks its not going to happen anymore  were going to trade  were going to trade but i say were going to now have a twolane you now we have a one  we have a onelane superhighway going into mexico right you know that hello   we have a onelane highway going into mexico were going to make it maybe for a little while to get some of it back a onelane highway coming back but ultimately its going to be like this we want to be fair were going to bring pennsylvania steel and manufacturing back were going to unleash trillions in new energy and were going to put our miners back to work were going to protect our hunters and save our second amendment  hillary clinton wants to do big big damage big big damage to the second amendment were going to fix your schools and your inner cities and reduce crime and poverty and joblessness and were going to liberate millions of africanamericans and hispanic americans from poverty what theyre going through is unbelievable  were going to make pennsylvania and ohio and so many other places within our country the manufacturing hub of the world once again were going to be able to do it its going to be not even hard to do but to do these things we must push aside the politicians and the special interests who have betrayed us theyve betrayed us so this year we have an election coming up on november th so important that you get out and vote so important that you watch other communities because we dont want this election stolen from us we dont want this election stolen from us we do not want this election stolen we have a

sessions and rudy get up here please  were going to make pennsylvania so rich again your jobs are coming back  were going to be ending illegal immigration  were going to stop the jobs from pouring out of our country  were going to renegotiate our disastrous trade deals these are deals made by people that dont have a clue were going to lower your taxes big league hillary wants to increase your taxes by a lot  were going to reduce regulations which are killing your companies and theyre leaving and theyre going to mexico and lots of other places for lots of reasons but one of the reasons is a bad reason its called regulations they are regulating these companies out of existence and jobs out of existence we are going to unleash american energy including oil   shale clean coal and natural gas  now this just came out this just came out wikileaks i love wikileaks  and i said write a couple of them down lets see during a speech look at hillary clinton oh shes crooked folks shes crooked as a threedollar bill  ok heres one it just came out lock her up is right no  so everybody saw the debate last night so let me tell you when i said we are going to get a special prosecutor to figure this deal out  i have never been so ashamed of this country as whats gone on with hillary clinton i have never seen anything like it i have never ever seen anything like it you have never seen anything like it thirtythree thousand emails  thirtythree thousand she deletes them she bleaches them  that nobody does because its such an expensive process she gets a subpoena from the united states congress and after she gets the subpoena she does that but well talk about that in a minute we have to go back to wikileaks so wikileaks  so a speech made behind closed doors crooked hillary clinton said that terrorism was not a threat quote not a threat to the nation no let me tell you  well big big big threat terrorism was not a threat let me tell you terrorism is a big threat were riding into something thats very dangerous and shes allowing thousands and thousands of people to come into this country and i will tell you something its the great trojan horse and we dont want to be part of the era  well we have the great  well theyre talking about us in  years from now ok as the stupid people that got taken then over here lets see and bragged about her great relationship with the financial industry thats where she gets all the money in florida they say shes going to put ads on  to one and i think were going to win i think were going to win  hillary admitted  oh this is a beauty  during one of the secret speeches amazing how nothing is secret today when you talk about the internet no  hillary admitted that isis could infiltrate with the refugees great then why is she letting so many people into our country  she said wall street can police itself all right thats  who cares big bank clinton said needed wall street money in order to successfully  she needs  says here quote needs wall street money in order to successfully run a campaign ok so what else is new you know i said to her yesterday i said listen im going to have over  million in my campaign right so meaning i dont have to take money from all these characters that want everything because thats whats happening so shes out there and she got a lot of money she made  million   million while shes in office ok figure that one out figure that one out  so i said so look im putting up  million  its going to end up being more than that  but im putting up all this money and im also getting tremendous amounts of money from people like  a piece a record set no republican has ever done that no republican  which tells me that we have a great movement going on right thats what a great movement is but i said to hillary clinton why did you put up  million or  million  million put up some of the money that you ripped off when youre a secretary of state when youre in the senate figure it from the time they left the white house until now  million i said put some of the money into your campaign dont get it from these companies that all want favors so lets see what happens with that so lets see speech behind closed doors hillary said in order to be successful politically this is a bad one you need to have both a public and private position on public policy  in other words we have to tell you one thing and we have to tell the bankers is another thing thats good another closed door speech shes got a lot of money she wanted to have open borders  and open trade  trade with anybody there go the rest of your jobs your jobs are  percent gone now anyway there go the rest of your jobs she wants  in one of the other speeches universal health care coverage single parent system she wanted to be like canada but the people in canada with money when they have an operation they come down to this country because they have got a lot of problems up in canada so she wants to go forget it heres an interesting one sidney blumenthal  do you remember what ambassador stevens in benghazi was calling and writing and even  they were desperate for help they say like  times right the only one she was speaking to is sidney blumenthal whos a sleaze  hes a sleaze in fact obama wanted her restricted that she couldnt speak thats probably one of the reasons she wanted to have her private server you know she wanted to go  because she promised obama that she wouldnt be talking to sleazy sidney so blumenthal writes a quote  this just came out a little while ago i have to tell you this one important point has been universally acknowledged by the nine previous reports about benghazi this is sidney blumenthal the only one she was talking to she wasnt talking to ambassador stevens even the  calls probably desperation the attack was almost certainly preventable benghazi clinton was incharge of the state department and it failed to protect the united states personnel and an american consulate in libya he meant benghazi if the gop wants to raise that as a talking point against her it is legitimate in other words she is now admitting that they could have done something about benghazi this just came out a little while ago  what a group we have what a group  what a group we have so were going to do a lot were working very hard we have  days november th is the big day were going to get out were going to win im going to make three four five stops a day i may be limping across that finish line but were going to get across that finish line  and i figure  i figure that that final week maybe we do six stops a day and well call them get out the vote stops if you dont mind well make them a lot shorter than what were doing just get out because we got to get you out to vote and honestly folks you know i went to school in philadelphia and i love philadelphia  i love philadelphia and i hope were going to do great in philadelphia i went to school there i love the school i loved everything but i just hear such reports about philadelphia and we have to make sure were protected we have to make sure the people of philadelphia protected that the vote counts are  percent everybody wants that but i hear these horror shows  i hear these horror shows and we have to make sure that this election is not stolen from us and is not taken away from us  and everybody knows what im talking about and this crooked media you can talk about crooked hillary  theyre worse than she is  im telling you they are so dishonest without the media  without the media hillary clinton couldnt be elected dog catcher i mean that its true true  rudy knows i only tell the truth i only tell the truth you know they do focus groups after the debate we won every poll we won did you see those polls every poll    i get a list but we dont want to put  but every poll but cnn did a focus group  and by the way frank luntz did a focus group and the focus group  that one we liked  frank luntz good guy  to four in favor of trump right  cnn did a focus group unfortunately  its so sad they got caught trying to convince people and find the right people so they could give a phony vote cnn is a disgrace  disgrace  they just turned off their camera  so funny they just turned off their camera i love it  i love it now these dishonest people theyre dishonest but you know when you look at them and in fact if somebody get me  get me  get me a list where is the great dan scavino get me a list ill tell you about the list bring it up here right away bring it up here ill tell you but we had a good time last night and they just sent out  they had  million people watching which is just about they say the most ever to watch the second debate which is fantastic  which is fantastic and even the bad media admitted you know when i say the line in the sand and she said i wasnt secretary of state unfortunately she was she lied again she lied hillary lied but it wasnt as big a lie as the emails dont you agree no no no she lied shes a liar  and she lied  and she lied when she said that she didnt say that tpp  transpacific partnership  was the gold standard right she lied because she endorsed it she wanted it  percent then she heard me speaking about it and say they dont control monetary manipulation in all the ways that this country has taken advantage of and she went against it temporarily but if she ever won shell approve that so fast and nothing is as bad as nafta but you know what thats going to be close its going to be a disaster  its going to be a disaster and so she lied she said i never said it was the gold standard unfortunately it was the gold standard so one of those things one of those things so folks its so important that we get out in november that we vote so we get rid of these liars we get rid of these incompetent people we get rid of the hillary clintons of the world  and you know im with the congressman and were backstage and a poll came out like were down three points in the states of pennsylvania and theyre going  and these guys are pros you may not like them because they are politicians but i like them anyway despite theyre being a politician but you know they said we cant believe it because everybody in pennsylvania wants trump you know and   and we get crowds like this everywhere but we get them in ohio we get them in florida were doing  we have one in florida coming up  minimum  minimum two days but were getting them but they just said  they said theres no way were three down even the polls are crooked im telling you look were in a rig system folks were in a rig system the only way we can unrig them is get to the polls but we got to make sure theyre honest polls we got to make sure but i think november th is going to be brexit but i   you know when i  when i have a lot of property over there so they ask me about brexit and i said well i think its going to pass meaning they wanted independence the uk wanted to get out they didnt want people pouring in to their country who nobody knew where they came from right so i said no i think its going to pass huge headlines trump says its going to pass remember obama went over there he said hes going to put them on the back of the line and its never going to pass and if it does theyre going to put them in the back of the line i think he helped it pass you want to know the truth so they said its going to pass and i said its going to pass but it was given very very little chance of passage very very little chance and then what happened is it passed easily right so the polls were all really wrong but big league wrong were just a little tiny bit behind here and the polls were just like unbelievable so it passed and nobody said trump said it was going to happen i hate that you know i hate that but what is going to happen i think the state of pennsylvania were going to win so big im just thinking  i think were going to win in pennsylvania  and were going to spend a lot of time in the suburbs over the next couple of weeks the suburbs of philadelphia because we got to get that vote we want to get that vote i know youre gonna vote right right  so were going to get that vote and well get it fast where are those polls bring them up here dan scavino everybody the famous dan scavino  let me see did anybody ever hear of dan hes become quite famous in social media all right you ready so it says here in  ah drudge is a great guy right right  what a great man trump  clinton  this is the list  variety you know thats the show business people but theyre not going to like this these people dont like trump you know the showbiz trump  see this guy doesnt stop look at this guy trump  clinton   listen to this time magazine  now do you think time magazine likes me even though ive been on their cover like seven or eight times theyre liking us time magazine no fan of trump  to   fox  fox  to  where are the other couple of points  heres a good one  well theyre are the slightly conservative  breitbart  to seven would you say that  fox seattle  to   detroit  to  get the hell out of here dan   so were going to have  is there any more fun to be than a trump rally in all fairness right  so heres what im going to tell you you know i spend a lot of time with senator sessions whos the king of the borders he is the king one of the great men one of the most highly respected men in the united states senate and they go to him  and i remember ted cruz who endorsed me recently which was very nice  but i remember ted cruz has such respect for senator sessions and one of the reasons is nobody knows more about the border than senator sessions and we were talking a little while ago and we have people coming in and we just got ice two days ago  ice these are great people by the way theyre not allowed to do their job but theyre great people they just endorsed me because they want to do their job  the border patrol the border patrol just endorsed me  the border patrol just endorsed me and i will tell you such an honor  border patrol agents they endorsed trump first time theyve ever done it and then very importantly sheriff joe from arizona we love joe  and i told new hampshire which has a tremendous problem with heroin and other places but new hampshire was the first state i went and then we went in to run like people havent seen very easily but i told new hampshire very very strongly i told new hampshire if i win were going to solve the problem of this poison flowing into pennsylvania   to new york to new england to all of these different places to ohio  where they have a big problem  to florida were going to stop the poison  and to do that were going to build a wall  who is going to pay for the wall   who   they dont know it yet but theyre paying for the wall right they dont know  no theyre great i was with a few of our friends we went to mexico two months ago we had a great meeting with the president and hes a good guy and were working that everybody is going to be happy but right now its a very unfair highway going in its a highway going in and theres no highway going out our jobs our money our wealth is going there a friend of mine who builds plants hes the biggest he builds plants thats what he does if you said build an apartment maybe he wouldnt do so well but he builds the best plants in the world  biggest and the best and i said how are you doing and you might have heard me say this i think its incredible and frankly its terrible in a certain way he said donald im doing great the business is great i said good how is it in the united states not very good where is it good he said mexico he said its the seventh wonder of the world he said its the most incredible thing youve ever seen we are building some of the biggest most sophisticated plants in the world now the people are coming out of michigan ford announced  as you know  ford just announced that theyre moving their entire building of small cars to mexico  out of mexico thats on top of a  billion plant that they built three years ago that ive been complaining about for three years and thats why i think were going to win in the state of michigan because ive been complaining about this for years and these other guys like hillary she started complaining in about two  two days ago shes not going to do anything so were going to create strong borders and were not going to let our businesses go and when ford says were leaving or when carrier airconditioning says theyre leaving the great state of indiana where we have a wonderful wonderful vice presidential nominee  mike pence great friend a great guy and by the way a totally loyal person this guy he called me up do you mind if i put out a statement no what  what would you like to put out  just absolutely put it out mike this guy is so loyal so good and such a terrific person and his family karen his wife and family is amazing he was one of our really good choices do you agree with that one of our really good choices  and hes done a great job in indiana aaa rating lower the taxes done really a good job unlike this guy tim kaine  you know in his first week as governor of virginia he signed a  billion tax increase this is what you have and hillary clinton wants to raise your taxes  but he signed a  billion tax increase  so heres whats going to happen folks when these companies like carrier airconditioning think theyre going to leave indiana or leave pennsylvania or leave ohio or leave any of your states they can go between states i cant get involved ok if you dont mind you gotta  thats up to you and your governor and all of the people but if they think theyre going to go out and theyre going to make airconditioners move to mexico build their new plant and sell those airconditioners now through a very strong powerful border and theyre going to sell those airconditioners and theyve let  people go in indianapolis not going to happen that way  not going to happen there will be consequences they will pay a  percent tax on every airconditioner that comes across the border  and when they know that they wont leave indiana and these companies wont leave pennsylvania and theyre not there because their numbers dont work anymore ok were going to stop them so easily and ive been watching these politicians go through this for years ive been watching them give low interest loans ive been watching them give zero interest loans  these companies dont even need the money most of them they take the money there were a couple of instances where geniuses with great lawyers gave them money and then they moved anyway because they didnt have any restrictive confidence in the  i mean the whole thing is crazy but whats going to happen is once they find out theyre not going to leave ok theyre not going to leave so were going to have strong borders were going to have a wall the wall is going to stop people from coming into our country illegally   along with border patrol and ice the wall is going to stop poison drugs poison from ruining our youth and poisoning our youth and other people  and you know i have something i always like doing i read this when im in a good mood  im in such a great mood you know i wish those cameras would show this crowd because if they would people would be amazed they never show the crowd  they never show the crowd show the crowd see they dont want to turn around  look at the cameras they face straight they face  my wife is always going how was the crowd she said it sounded big but i never see it they never show the crowd because you know what they dont want us to win and they dont show these crowds but you look at these crowds bernie sanders never even came close and he was second by the way hey fellas turn the cameras around seriously way up there in the upper decks show the crowds  but they just dont want to do it they keep that camera pinned to my face they dont even want to show whats behind me they keep that camera pinned to my face   they are so dishonest   you know if crooked hillary clinton were up here and they had this kind of a crowd the cameras would be showing the crowd all day long  thats why we have to win this election we have to take it away from these dishonest characters so heres the story folks its true every night i go home my wife said how big was the crowd she said it sounded huge i said yes they have like what  people so she said yes it sounded that i said didnt you see it no they never showed the crowd its always my face  my face i dont want to  i dont want to show my face i want the crowd but they never moved the camera you know i used to think they couldnt i figured their brand new equipment they couldnt because mechanically they didnt moved and then when theyre  but unfortunately when we had a protester the first time right you know what im going to say those cameras they turned like a pretzel the steel wow wow  so they look like pretzels i never  i never knew that steel could be bent in that kind of a configure  theyre dishonest but because of the fact that we have lots of problems but one of the problems we have a tremendous illegal immigration problem and now hillary clinton wants people to come in from syria at a rate  think of this  theyre coming to your community folks at a rate of  percent more than obama and hes letting them in by the thousands and we have no idea who the hell they are so i have this  has anyone heard the snake because people love it but  ok who has  who has not heard it who has heard it  shall we do it or not   its so good so you think of this in terms of illegal immigration in terms of people coming into our country that we have no idea who they are and in terms of the fact that lots of bad things will happen and again before i start i have a big heart you have a big heart we all have big hearts we want to see good things happen right so were going to build safe zones in syria were going to have the gulf states pay for it because we owe right now  trillion its double during obamas term and the bad part it doubled though we didnt do anything we didnt fix our roads our bridges our tunnels our hospitals our airports are a mess theyre like third world so we have totally too much debt and we didnt fix anything we got problems folks but well get it fixed if we get elected otherwise were going down so this is a case for illegal immigration and it was written by al wilson anybody ever heard of al wilson and it wasnt meant for this it was a song but i saw it once and i thought it was very apropos so this is thinking about illegal immigration and whats going to happen as sure as you are  sorry we have no seats  standing there on a way to work one morning down the path along the lake a tenderhearted woman saw a poor halffrozen snake his pretty colored skin had been all frosted with the dew poor thing she said ill take you in and ill take care of you take me in oh tender woman take me in for heavens sake take me in oh tender woman sighed the broken snake she wrapped them up all cozy in the comfort of silk and laid him by the fireside with some honey and some milk she hurried home from work that night and as soon as she arrived she found that pretty snake she taken in had been revived take me in oh tender woman take me in for heavens sake take me in oh tender woman sighed the broken snake she clutched him to her bosom youre so beautiful she cried but if i hadnt brought you in by now you surely might have died she stroked his pretty skin again and kissed and held him tight but instead of saying thank you the snake gave her a vicious bite take me in oh tender woman take me in for heavens sake take me in oh tender woman sighed the vicious snake  vicious vicious vicious i saved you cried the woman and youve bit me heavens why you know your bite is poisonous and now im going to die oh shut up silly woman said the reptile with a grin you knew damn well i was a snake before you took me in  and then we have very incompetent politicians in washington taking everybody in that honestly its a very sad thing to behold and to watch very very very sad is there a doctor in the house are you ok thank you very much thank you are you ok you know we have people waiting here for seven eight hours i love you darling i love you look at her  shes tougher than all of us thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you look at that guy over there  wow wow   bring him up  whats your  whats your name   now hes supposed to look like donald trump but hes actually much too goodlooking you are really handsome  are you having a good time tonight   where is your daddy and your mommy right do you want to go back  do you want to go back to them or do you want to stay with donald trump   beautiful what a beautiful boy what a beautiful boy thank you   ill tell you what folks we better win on november th you know one of these  one of these pundits said to me  because this is a movement theres never been anything like this  they say  many of them said  bill oreilly said  a lot of respect for bill oreilly tough guy smart guy  he said its the single greatest political phenomena hes seen in his lifetime that covers a lot of territory and others have said the same thing and they said really it doesnt matter if you win or if you lose it doesnt matter because what  i said let me tell you a little secret if we dont win this is the greatest waste of time energy and money that i will ever do in my life believe me  believe me were not doing this to come in second folks and if we come in second your second amendment is in trouble because she wants to decimate it  and were going to fix  by the way you know were going to do something that people havent done were going to fix our inner cities were going to help our latinoamericans and our africanamericans were going to help them  fortyfive percent of africanamerican youth lives in poverty fiftyeight percent of africanamerican youth dont have jobs more than  people have been shot in the city of chicago since the beginning of the year  think of that  since january st  that means its like a war zone the democrats like crooked hillary clinton   have run the inner cities for    even  years uninterrupted they produce only more joblessness failing schools and rising crime those africanamericans suffering in our country  and i have to tell you this  theyre suffering  theyre suffering you got no jobs  inner cities you got no jobs you have no safety you have no education the schools are horrible i say to them what the hell do you have to lose im going to fix the inner cities im going to fix them  im going to fix them vote for trump weve spent  billion  think of this think of this  we spent billions and billions of dollars on different things we dont get our monies worth but weve spent in the middle east  to  trillion what do we have its worse now had we done nothing in the middle east its much better than it is now you wouldnt have the migration look at the mistakes that hillary clinton made libya iraq they created isis because the way they got out of iraq whether you like going into the war or not and despite what you read from these dishonest people i was against going into iraq by the way but whether you were in or not it was somewhat with the surge stabilized and they announced to the world that theyre going to take everybody out real fast get them out get them out get them out and the vacuum was created and guess who came out of the vacuum who came out of the vacuum isis that was hillary clinton and our great genius president barack obama  and now what he does  all he wants to do is campaign remember he said donald trump will never win the republican primary all right so weve won that one right isnt it too bad  isnt it too bad that we dont have stronger leadership on both sides  on both sides i mean you know you have people that cant fix a budget but then they start talking about their nominee but they cant fix the budget isnt it really sad that we dont have stronger leadership on both sides but thatll change if we win on november th believe me its going to change fast  going to change fast  but why is it that the president of the united states weve got no growth you saw gnp you saw that gdp you saw that right its so bad like one percent that means were not growing do you know if china goes down to seven or eight percent its like considered a national tragedy here we are hovering at nothing our jobs are gone we have bad jobs they have a phony employment rate bad jobs numbers last week did you see those bad jobs numbers and thats the last jobs report before the election i was shocked i was so surprised that they let that happen because its all rigged  its all rigged but let me just tell you were going to do something thats going to be so amazing im going to fight harder than anybody has ever fought for the american people  harder  were going to help the latinos trapped in poverty were going to fight for school choice were going to fight to end common core which well do very quickly and bring education locally  and hillary clinton cant do those things because shes totally run by the teachers union which are wonderful people by the way but they have total control so you cant choice and you cant end common core if youre hillary clinton you cant do it because youre controlled by the teachers just like shes controlled by wall street so what were going to do are things that havent been done and these things are going to be wonderful we have a military thats depleted we have to build up our military we have to  we have no choice  we have to take care of our great veterans were not taking care of our veterans not taking care of  were going to save your second amendment were going to terminate obamacare and replace it  were going to have the largest tax cut since ronald reagan remember this hers are going up we are going to do things that are going to make you so proud of this country again youre going to be so proud youre going to go to the polls and youre going to even home tonight and youre going to say to your husband to your wife to your children to whoever listens i had a great time but youre going to look back in  years in  and  years and  years and youre going to say this was one of the most

take care of our minors were going to take care of our steelworkers were going to not let the epa destroy our companies for natural gas and shale and all other things not going to let it happen  were not going to let it happen so youre going to go home and youre going to say great evening great evening but youre going to look back at that vote and youre going to say that was a very very important day that that was the greatest vote ive ever cast because thats when our country started turning around  thats when our country started turning around  and youre going to be proud of your country again and hopefully youre going to be very proud of your president and youre going to see things happen that have never happened before were going to make great trade deals were going to have a strong military and hopefully were not going to have to use it but its called peace through strength  and were going to have our borders back again and people are going to come into our country but theyre going to come in legally they arent going to come in  were going to have a big beautiful door  but theyre going to come in legally through a process and its not going to be a process now where people are waiting in line for  years and they dont move and you had people come right across the border so unfair were going to have a fair process and we want people to come in is that correct we want people but they have to come in legally  and were going to see immediate change and thats what you need hillary clinton is not about change hillary clinton has been doing this stuff for  years  and i said to her last night  i said to her last night i said you know hillary you talk about this thing and that thing and donalds got some great tax deal but all her friends have the same thing all her friends they said hillary you are united states senator why didnt you something about it shes not going to do anything about anything its just talk and you saw it and i said when she was a senator she

in  days were going to win florida and we are going to win back the white house were going to win them back  id like to begin tonight by extending our thoughts and prayers to those recovering from the tragic aftermath of hurricane matthew and i watched and fortunately it took a little bit of a turn to the right to the east and we got a little lucky but it was still very bad so to everybody our thoughts and prayers are with you thank you due to the hurricane voter registration its been extended did you hear about this through tomorrow so register youve got to go and register or weve really  you know were doing something thats incredible its a movement but if we dont win all it is is a little asterisk in history theres never been anything like this so go and register make sure you get out and vote november th  if youve already registered request an absentee ballot today and vote really early weve got to win the hillary clinton documents released today by wikileaks make more clear than ever just how much is at stake in this election so much corruption this election will determine whether we remain a free country in the truest sense of the word or we become a corrupt banana republic controlled by large donors and foreign governments the election of hillary clinton would lead to the destruction of our country believe me it will lead to the destruction of our country today we learned amazingly that the department of justice fed information to the clinton campaign about the email investigation so that the campaign could be prepared to cover up her crimes what is going on  rudy giuliani said it this is collusion and corruption of the highest order and is one more reason why i ask my attorney general i will ask to appoint a special prosecutor  we have to investigate hillary clinton and we have to investigate the investigation this was a disgrace this was a disgrace hillary bleached and deleted  emails after congressional subpoenas can you imagine that they got a subpoena from the united states congress and then they deleted everything if you did that in private life you go to jail and then destroyed her phones some with a hammer boom anybody destroy your phones before with a hammer anybody no anybody no and people have gone to jail for doing far less she also lost think of this she was secretary of state lost as much as  billion in taxpayer money while she was running secretary of state now some people say it was misplaced oh billions of dollars misplaced these wikileaks emails confirm what those of us here today have known all along hillary clinton is the vessel a corrupt global establishment thats raiding our country and surrendering the sovereignty of our nation this criminal government cartel doesnt recognize borders but believes in global governance unlimited immigration and rule by corporations it also believes in no borders just come on folks come on in speaking in secret to a foreign bank again just revealed hillary clinton said my dream is a hemispheric common market with open trade and open borders well there go the rest of your businesses and there goes your country folks  she doesnt say that behind closed doors when she thought no one was listening she pledged to dissolve the borders of the united states of america no borders you dont have borders we dont have a country wikileaks has given us a window into the secret corridors of government power where we see a former secretary of state announcing her desire to end forever the american independence that our founders gave to us and wanted us to have american soldiers has fought and died to win and keep americas freedom and now hillary clinton wants to surrender that freedom to these open borders open trade and a world government and by the way we want a government for the united states were very happy with it were very happy with it  crooked hillary is so radical on immigration that as secretary of state she refused to make foreign countries take back their criminal aliens we have them all over the place she didnt want to bring them back bring them back  the countries were smart they say we dont want them we say ok well take them and then you look at the crime and you wonder why and by the way do you know it was just announced that murder is the highest its been in our country in  years youve heard that right one such killer who was set free on hillarys watch went to a jail came out and went on to kill a beautiful young american girl named casey chadwick people have heard that name beautiful wonderful person the killer who had already been convicted for shooting a girl in the head should have been sent home instead he was set free and stabbed casey in the face and neck  times violently and stuffed her body in a closet the corrupt establishment in washington wants to surrender americas borders even as they send our troops overseas to protect the borders of foreign countries we are protecting the borders of foreign countries but not our borders a trump administration will secure control defend and protect the borders of the united states we are going to protect  and the border patrol agents just gave us as you know their endorsement never did it before ice just gave us their endorsement sheriff joe from arizona just gave us his endorsement  even chelsea clinton the wikileaks emails show expressed serious concerns about conflicts of interest at the clinton foundation and the state department during a recent trip to florida i had a chance to spend some time with the incredible residents of little haiti the haitian community has contributed so much to this country and to this state i also learned from them firsthand how much they despise the clintons for what they did to the people of haiti new emails revealed today by abc news show that during the deadly earthquake in haiti which killed over  people at least the clintons couldnt stop cashing in as people were dying in haiti clinton insiders were separating out requests from friends of bill or william jefferson clinton vips so that their business interests or contracts would receive very special treatment people who were labeled not friends of bill were placed very much on the sidelines in their biggest project the clintons used  million in aid and us taxpayer funds to build what amounted to a massive sweatshop and guess who set it up cheryl mills hillarys chief of staff who helped destroy her emails and then got immunity from the fbi that included the destruction of her computer  never been anything  folks theres never been anything like this theres never been whats gone on here with the email destruction with the deletion of thousands and thousands and last week it was revealed that two boxes of emails and information were missing they were missing theyre gone the company that benefited from millss actions then invent a company that put a lot of money in a company owned by cheryl mills they invested today haitis death toll from hurricane matthew is on the rise we should never forget how bill and hillary clinton handled haiti the last time out to all of our friends in haiti and to all of our friends in little haiti who are so amazing your day of justice is coming and it arrives on november th weve got to do this gotta do it weve got to do it  not only have the clintons ripped off haiti but the new emails show members of the clinton team attacking catholics while this is offensive its just the latest evidence of the hatred that the clinton campaign has really for everyday americans and you see it and you see so much from these wikileaks you see so much theres so much weve all read the reports and heard the stories about how disrespectfully she treats law enforcement youve seen it how disrespectful she is to the secret service and many others in uniform even there to protect her and by the way these are weaponcarrying people they carry weapons hillary clinton wants to really dismantle our second amendment you know so maybe she should start with her security people not carrying weapons does that make sense to you maybe maybe she should  she even smeared all of americas police officers as essentially racist you heard that recently essentially racist and by the way i want to give a shout out and salute to our great people of law enforcement our police have done an amazing job  im proud of the fact that ive always treated the working people of this country with dignity and respect especially our military and law enforcement personnel these are amazing people the wikileaks emails show that hillarys staff even has given up secret notes on when she needs to smile its all a phony deal with her by the way did everybody see the debate right  gotten good reviews good reviews weve gotten good reviews well see what happens but pat buchanan said the greatest of any presidential debate the greatest performance thank you very much folks thank you  and we had eight online polls and every one of those thats time magazine and drudge and so many others and every one of them said we won by a massive margin so lets hope it all boils down to winning on november th otherwise honestly ive wasted my time youve wasted your time i will have spent over  million on running for office thats a lot of money a lot of money thats not the thing if i dont win it will be the singlegreatest waste of time energy and money and you know somebody told me recently a pundit said it doesnt matter whether you win or lose what weve done all of us what weve done but what ive done has never been duplicated theres never been anything like this in american history you look at our crowds i mean bernie sanders was second his crowds are tiny did you see hillary clinton today she had this little crowd and they say oh it was the biggest crowd she had nothing she had nothing  and theyre talking on television because the medias rigged let me tell you   the best thing shes got going in my opinion the only thing shes got going is the rigged media shes got nothing going can you imagine working with her for four more years the last thing we need the last thing we need is another four years of barack obama we dont need that believe me  thats what were going to get if we get her but the emails also show yet again that the dnc democratic national committee rigged the democratic election the primary process to take it away from bernie and give it to hillary clinton the dnc vice chair was caught feeding information about bernie sanderss plans to the clinton campaign youre not supposed to do that its supposed to be  you know if i was bernie i wouldnt be too happy after watching what came out today on wikileaks bernie was used and in all fairness bernie made a deal with the devil and he made a big mistake he could have gone down as something very important in american history when he made that deal he sold out he sold out and very very bad but to all the bernie voters out there dont vote for a wall street sellout like hillary clinton and remember this the one thing i had in mind and the one thing we had in common with crooked hillary was borders the borders are much stronger thats why i have all the endorsements from everybody on the borders but bernie knew that we were getting ripped off on trade and he was right except my numbers are much different were going to redo it were going to have unbelievable trade deals were going to make unbelievable deals but to the bernie sanders people you got sold out but remember this im much stronger on trade so much stronger on trade than bernie and trade was a big deal because he was right we are getting sold out our jobs are being lost our jobs are being taken were being sold out a vote for hillary is a vote for more reckless foreign invasions more wall street cheating more terrible trade deals and as confirmed just today by wikileaks hillary also wants to cute medicare and social security she wants to do that  a vote for trump is a vote for america first and its a vote to protect medicare and social security believe me were going to protect our medicare were going to protect our social security shes not going to do it  shes also going to raise your taxes big league folks and were going to lower your taxes minor minor thing but just remember it wikileaks also shows something ive been warning everybody  everybody  about for a long time the media is simply an extension of hillary clintons campaign its just one more way that the system is rigged a big way really a big way reporters who work for these outlets like the washington post or the new york times may think of themselves as journalists but theyre actually just cogs in a corporate political machine the dishonesty of the new york times is unbelievable the dishonest of the washington post is unbelievable the dishonesty of all of those cameras so many of them not all of them is unbelievable  the emails show the new york times the boston globe univision a thirdrate reporter named john harwood what a thirdrate reporter that one is remember he did the debate and made a total fool of himself hes with cnbc all doing favors for the clintons and reporters smothering the clintons with praise why why you saw hillary on the debate stage do you think thats really worthy do you really think thats worthy folks do you think thats what this country is all about  the new york times even gave clinton veto power over her quotes in a major story ive never heard about that id like to have veto power when they misquote me all the time its actually corruption the emails also show that hillary was given the cnn town hall questions before her big debate against bernie sanders is that possible donna brazile the dnc vice chair emailed from time to time i get questions in advance she said oh thats fair do you think thats fair to bernie   im starting to feel really arent we starting to feel sorry for bernie sanders like a little bit right the media cant report on the establishment because the media largely is the establishment and the corrupt media is teamed up against you the american people and i used to get great press until i said im running and then they said hes running we dont want him to run but i used to get great  who got better press than me i got great press a lot of press my wife said the other day you used to get such great press now every single story is a slant and ill tell you what its libelous its slanderous its horrible and its really unfair but were going to beat the system were going to beat the system  were going to break up the failed establishment end the chronic corruption and create a new and bright american future i didnt need to do this folks i didnt need to do this but we have to do it and we have the greatest people on earth the people of our country these are the greatest people on earth ive gotten to know so many our veterans are so incredible theyre not being taken care of our military our police we have the greatest people on earth hillary clinton the candidate of the past today dredged up al gore did you see him anybody see him  didnt he say he was the founder of the internet he wasnt to campaign with her in florida al gore wants to eliminate the combustion engine essentially and flies around the world on jets and pushes plans that would help create china make it stronger they make so much of our product they make so much they make so many of our big windmills and you know when theyre making them that steel and all of that stuff that they talk about going up into the air but if its got to go up into the air maybe we should be making them instead of china germany and other places  the obamaclinton epa spent billions on failed climate projects instead of repairing water infrastructure in cities like flint remember flint what a shame my administration will address important environmental priorities like the everglades and ensure quality water all across america including the fixing of water problems like lake okeechobee its amazing you know lake okeechobee theyre always letting the water out do you ever notice we always have droughts theyre always letting the water out i said keep it in we wont have so many droughts we wont have any droughts but lake okeechobee  and you know a lot of things have happened hillary has received millions of dollars from donors who want to shut down american energy altogether radical activists like tom steyer have promised to spend more than  million this election to get clinton and democrats like her elected in return clinton wants to shut down energy production all across the united states wait until you see your energy bills were going to put the miners and the steelworkers of our country back to work well do it  hillary clinton and al gore support the paris deal which will cost america over  trillion and cause florida electricity rates to skyrocket over the years skyrocket think of it were going to spend  trillion and you know whats going to happen were going to become noncompetitive with other countries other countries are eating our lunch right now theyre eating our lunch were going to become noncompetitive the paris deal also allows china the worlds largest polluter by far to increase emissions for more than a dozen years while the united states makes drastic cuts immediately right now whats that all about why arent we doing it together whats that about who negotiates our deals its one more way the clintons have surrendered american prosperity to china and so many other countries we are led by people that are grossly incompetent theyre grossly incompetent how about the  million in cash that they gave iran that turned out to be  billion  you know what  billion is its like this stage loaded up with money nobodys ever seen it can you imagine these people in iran when they see the money they say can you believe this boy did we hit the jackpot three years ago before we made them rich as a country they were ready to go but we made them rich we made them rich how about the  people ready for deportation remember two weeks ago ready for deportation they made a mistake they all became united states citizens right and these were people that were not exactly too good thats why they were being deported but the  turned out to be wrong somebody actually said trump was wrong on the number i said oh man here we got was it  was it  not i guess it was what   it turned out it was much more than the  they said i was wrong because i was low the whole thing is crazy so i said you know what thats ok just reverse the  you know you can deport them they said that wouldnt be constitutional hey folks folks were being led by stupid people were being led by stupid people  and hillary clinton will be worse than obama if im elected president we are going to start winning again we dont win anymore the wikileaks speeches even showed clinton praising the president of china for promising to assert his authority my energy proposals will unlock the  trillion in energy reserves right here in america this means new jobs in florida not new jobs in china were going to make america first folks america first  its all part of our plan to make america rich again but to make america rich again we also have to repeal and replace the disaster known as obamacare  bill clinton in a rare moment of truthtelling said obamacare was a crazy system where people wind up with their premiums doubled and their coverage cut in half now on this he was right right on this he was right weve got to give him credit oh boy did he suffer that night can you imagine that was last week he suffered gravely when he went home the next day he came in he said  he made another  sort of im only kidding im only kidding premiums are going to surge next year here in florida beyond what youve ever seen before and all across the country i just left texas great state theyve gone up  percent through blue cross blue shield  percent and remember this the election on november th theyre trying to announce many of these massive increases after the election dont let it happen youre going to have  percent increases youre going to have  percent increases but youve already got  percent  percent insurers are fleeing patients are losing their doctors remember you can keep your doctor you can keep your plan twentyeight times obama said that he lied and the best students dont want to be doctors anymore they used to want to be doctors doctors have more accountants working for them now than they have nurses its so complicated its a giant mess a giant catastrophe that will destroy american health care for good if we dont get rid of it and this election is going to be so pivotal in terms of your health care in terms of costs for health care so remember youre going to get great health care at a far far reduced cost its going to be much less expensive this obamacare is a nightmare it is a nightmare and by the way hillary clinton wants to go to single payer the governments going to take care of your everything its going to cost so much money you know in canada where they have a better version than what shes talking about when people with some money want an operation they come into the united states to get it its slow it doesnt work doesnt work anywhere we have concepts that are so good in fact concepts that are so good that theyll only get better so much less money so we have to repeal and replace obamacare its killing the country and its killing the people that have to pay for it   but you have to get out if were going to do it and you have to vote were going to replace obamacare with health savings accounts so you can choose the private doctor that you want at the center of our economic revival well be fixing our terrible terrible trade deals if you remember on june th of last year that is when i said were going to run you know it takes a lot of guts and courage to do this i started off there were  people great people all nice people some didnt you know honor their pledge but these are minor details right but we had some great people many of whom are supporting us dr ben carson we have a great guy great guy good man  chris christie i mean we have incredible support mike huckabee hes been so great on television hes so good  hes so good he said the other night donald trump won that debate by a landslide but that doesnt mean the press is going to report that they all reported trump won but mike huckabee said it better he said trump won it easy not even a contest but that doesnt mean that the cnns of the world will say that ok they wont ever say it they will never say it if the late great abraham lincoln debated and he was representing our point of view cnn would say abe lincoln went down to a massive defeat i mean these are dishonest people were dealing with these are very very dishonest people and its really a shame and their ratings are not very good either thats good you know why because some people they lose credibility the new york times is losing credibility remember they wrote the story about trump with women it was on the front page of the new york times that i was a little bit lewd  lewd but they had the story a few months ago with women and they put it on the front page of the new york times and then the women called in and said i didnt say that i like him a lot hes a great guy you know from  years ago and  years ago and  years ago and i was so honored that they had the courage to do it but the times never gave me you know any kind of a retraction its a disgrace whats going on with the media is disgraceful and its happening to all of us believe me its happening to all of us fortyseven million americans are living in poverty and  million americans are on food stamps this is the legacy of obamaclinton my economic reforms on energy taxes regulations and trade will create at least  million new jobs over the next  years its going to be unbelievable i will be the greatest jobs president that god ever created believe me  the state of florida has lost one in four manufacturing jobs since nafta and china deals happened   thank you i love you too darling  i love florida i love the people of florida ive created many many jobs in florida many many jobs you know jobs in miami beach doral is a tremendous success and mara lago and the clubs and weve done all of that hillary has done nothing for florida and remember when we were in the primary i ran against marco jeb all these guys and we had a great  hey look marcos been very very nice lately and i hope he wins i do but we won by  points remember that everyone said what happened how about all of these states you know i went into a couple of states trump was one point down doesnt look like  and then we win by like  points we could have this happen were pretty even in florida and im a little disappointed because hillary hasnt created a job and ive created thousands of jobs in florida thousands  i mean at doral i have over a thousand people working just at doral itself maralago trump international many many jobs buildings along the beach in miami you know weve created a lot of jobs so florida if you guys dont vote me as a victor im going to be very angry at you hillary doesnt come down to florida she comes down to florida to try and get your vote then you wont see her anymore if hillary clinton gets in the manufacturing thats left in florida ohio north carolina pennsylvania michigan will be shipped to other countries shipped overseas and go to mexico look theres no doubt about that if i win day one were going to announce our plans to totally renegotiate nafta which is a oneway street for businesses to leave our country  they get the businesses they get the cash and you know what we get we get the drugs thats what we get we get nothing we get unemployment and we get drugs the years of alltalk noaction politicians like her will end im not controlled by special interests so ill immediately begin to go to work on this thats why im putting up my own money for the most part other than were getting massive amounts of small contributions average  you saw the numbers in fact theyre going to be announced tomorrow set records for a republican on the small contributions i love that i love that and were doing good and we just came out with a new commercial on crooked hillary shes crooked as a  bill i used to say a  bill but now they make  bills if we dont get the deal we want on nafta  remember this remember i said it  we will leave nafta and start over again and make a much better deal ok we will terminate  a trump administration will also stand up to chinas product dumping and currency cheating and the steel what theyre doing to our steel companies is unbelievable with the dumping were going to start making things again in america were going to have apple make their iphones and make things in this country not make everything in china and vietnam and these other countries  were going to bring apple and many other companies theyre going to be back in the united states our jobs were going with much lower business taxes were bringing the tax rate from  percent to  percent and we are going to be booming again our taxes are so high our taxes are so high that businesses are forced to leave and by the way when businesses want to be ripped out of florida ripped out of your community not going to happen anymore because theres going to be consequences like carrier air conditioning in the state of indiana where mike pence by the way is doing a great job for me do we like mike  ok so mike did a great job he absolutely beat tim kaine who you know tim kaine raised taxes in his first week when he was governor of virginia not a popular governor he raised them by  billion mike on the other hand indiana you take a look i mean he has done such a great job so heres my question to you by cheering who did better in the debate are you ready youre going to cheer youre going to let me know so i did very well did you see hillary today did everybody see the debate yeah you lost got killed no i look forward next week we have another one i look forward hey did you see  wait wait wait did you see where she said that i entered her space so here i am im standing right you saw that this is a liar so im standing at my podium ive got my chair and crooked hillary walks across the stage right in front of me im standing i didnt move right right so im standing and she walks across the stage shes standing right in front of me i didnt care i didnt care and shes answering a question and then she walks right back ok thats fine i didnt make a big deal next day i read the paper he entered my space she entered my space right but did you see what she said that i entered her space i didnt move and i was very careful because years ago somebody did come in and talk to her and the poor guy lazio he got just killed so i said im not getting near this woman no im not getting near this woman at all no interest no interest i have no interest  but you saw that right so im standing there she walks she stands right next to me and the next day they said donald trump entered her space these are dishonest people anyway but next week we have another debate in las vegas so thatll be fun  america if i get elected will become  when when they always go when when but i like to you know  gotta leave here you dont want to sound too egotistical the polls are pretty even in florida you dont let me down  dont let me down honestly dont let yourselves down maybe more importantly america will become the great jobs magnet of the world remember that were also going to fix our inner cities and help our latino americans and believe me thats what we have to do the hispanics in this country have been treated very unfairly the african americans have been treated very very unfairly fortyfive percent of africanamerican youth live in poverty fiftyeight percent of americanamerican youth dont have jobs only  percent own their own home thats much much lower than other groups  percent thats a very low number one of the lowest more than  people have been shot in chicago since january st  people so the inner cities dont have jobs have a lousy education right have lousy horrible and theyre unsafe you get shot walking to the store so i say to the african americans suffering in our inner cities what do you have to lose vote for donald trump what do you have to lose  i will fix it i will do the job and in four years from now when we have another election i will win with african americans and i will win with hispanics in very large numbers were going to fix it these politicians have been lying to you for years these democrats theyve run the inner cities for up to a hundred years even more uninterrupted and they come for your vote every four years hillary clinton comes for your vote and youll get a vote and then after you get the vote shell say byebye ill see you in four years she doesnt do anything she didnt do anything for new york state remember upstate new york a disaster she came out and she said in upstate new york shes going to create  jobs guess what everybody left it was like a disaster she was a disaster and shes a bad person remember that shes a bad bad person i will fight harder for you than anyone ever has fought before and thats why i want to get the africanamerican vote and i want to get the hispanic vote were going to fix your communities were going to fix those inner cities for once and for all were going to fix them and were going to create jobs and great education and were going to have safe inner cities instead of these horrible horrible death traps and thats what they are  were going to fight for the latinos trapped in poverty that includes school choice for every lowincome africanamerican and latino hispanic child in this nation disadvantaged children will be able to send their kids to the public private charter or magnet school of their choice i also have a message for our wonderful cubanamerican community any cubans here cuban cuban american not too many but ill say it anyway all right obama made a onesided deal with the castro regime by executive order everythings executive order because he doesnt have enough time because hes playing so much golf he doesnt have enough time to convince congress to do it this guy plays more golf than people on the pga tour we will cancel the obama order unless we get the deal that we want including political and religious freedom for the people of cuba we will also stand with our friends in venezuela as they struggle for freedom and doral is located in a big community where we have tremendous numbers of people from venezuela amazing people the people of venezuela and cuba know how dangerous corruption is and how dangerous socialism is two more reasons why we have to keep crooked hillary clinton out of the white house  here are some more amazing things as we finish up that were going to do for our country starting in  right around the corner we are going to massively cut taxes and regulations she is going to increase taxes substantially were going to protect internet freedom you see where they want to sell now they want to have the internet run by the world right did you see what obama wants to do oh i hope we can stop that deal fast did you see that wants to give up that tremendous right were going to defend religious liberty  were going to safeguard our very obsolete electrical grid from cyberattack cyberattack is a new big problem were going to rebuild our depleted military and we are going to take care of our great veterans we have tremendous veteran support tremendous veteran support  were going to construct a stateoftheart system of missile defense were going to expand americas true role as a leader in space we are going to save our second amendment which is under siege by hillary clinton  and the national rifle association the nra as you know endorsed me the earliest endorsement theyve ever given to a presidential candidate and we are going to and this is so important appoint justices to the united states supreme court who will uphold and defend the constitution of the united states  you have  days to make every dream that you ever dreamed for your country to come true on november th its so important the arrogance of washington dc will come facetoface with the righteous verdict of the american voter you  we are going to replace our corrupt global establishment that has failed us on the borders on trade on foreign policy on the economy and so much more we dont win anymore folks we dont win anymore when did you see us win we lose on trade we cant beat isis oh by the way were going to knock the hell out of isis were going to knock the hell out of them  were going to replace the failed leadership in washington who have

rallies imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as one people under one god saluting one american flag  youre going to look back at this rally for the rest of your

thousand people folks and over there theres thousands of people trying to get in i wish the fire department would let them in in all fairness  were outside we dont need a fire marshal were outside so fire marshal will you let the people in please  i assume the fire marshal is a democrat i assume  unbelievable it never stops but ill tell you weve had a  an amazing time we just left as you know i know the  florida which is a great great section especially if you like horses and we had a crowd that you would not  over  people  and they couldnt get them all in either they never can because theres movement going on thats amazing and in  days we are going to win florida and we are going to win back  were going to bring back our jobs were going to renegotiate our disastrous trade deals were going to reduce surging crime which is going down and bad bad numbers were going to cut taxes big league and she is going to raise your taxes big league  were going to get rid of many of our unnecessary regulations lift the restrictions on american energy and were going to end common core  were going to reduce to cost of college which is going up in record setting pace make child care affordable so important and we are going to repeal and replace the disaster known as obamacare  were going to put america first and were going to be united in our love for our country we are a divided country right now divided almost like never before we are going to be a united country again  this election is a simple choice its a choice between putting our faith in a corrupt establishment or putting our faith in you the american people    you know i just said in front of this big big crowd we just literally left cant believe were going to end up doing  the last two weeks i said were going to do four or five of these a day can you believe that  now let me ask you first of all hillary has very small crowds nobody cares but  how many of these do you think hillary could do a day maybe a half i was at this massive  it was just like a really hot building it was a steep toe  it was over  degrees we went for an hour and  minutes the people were unbelievable and i said jokingly i said if the people of florida dont vote for me im going to be very angry and one of the news commentators said donald trump admonished  the people of florida  and you know who im talking about these guys are so crooked their worse than hillary clinton  i think they might be more crooked than hillary and thats saying a lot  i couldnt believe it im watching it  i said im going to be so angry at the people of florida joking everybodys joking everybodys laughing and he said he admonished  the people of florida they make us sound like such jerks its unbelievable i tell you what these are the most dishonest people youll ever see these are horrible horrible people now i know im  and you know who im talking about back there you should be ashamed of yourself  its a choice between the pessimism of the hillary clinton and the optimism of a move empowered by millions of people all over the country  shes been there for  years and hasnt dont anything but fail take a look at what shes done and during the last debate which you know look i want to partial and all which i won big league i mean that was not even close  how about this im standing at the podium my podium im standing by my chair right im standing and she walks across i said hi hillary how are you doing she walks across and she stands in front of me and then the next i wake up by saying oh we got all good reviews but wait of all of the online polls we won  out of  by big margins but forget it  forget it forget it so im standing at my podium by my chair she walks across the room shes standing in front of me right next to me and the next day i say what did the papers say they say he invaded her space i invaded her space  believe me the last space that i want to invade is her space believe me i dont want to invade her space   were still trying to let these poor people come in come on fire marshal do your job      so  so we love those people you know they stand here for hours they stand here for hours and ill tell you what see that woman she went down shell be back they all come back   we had one yesterday in a tremendous heat wave a tremendous  i mean  the place was hot and then you know i always like to say its  degrees because it is because some times if its really hot and if im doing a little sweat  not too much im not too bad weve all seen worse in the campaign trail havent we but if im doing a little theyll say donald trump was sweating its  degrees at  these    but you know these people when they go down they do go down and they all come back i dont even know if thats a good thing or a bad thing but our friends have courage its unbelievable   sorry about  that  but make sure shes great so the department of justice fed information to the clinton campaign about the email investigation so that the campaign could be prepared when they came into the interview did you ever hear a thing we have mayor giuliani one of the great mayors  one of the great prosecutors where is he where is our mayor where is our mayor   as you know he was one of the great prosecutors he said as long as ive done this ive never heard of anything and whats happened with the fbi is so sad and you have great great people in the fbi and i wouldnt know  although it looks like were reading stories about it they are so disgusted at whats gone on at the top they cannot even believe whats going on with the great institution of the fbi they cannot believe what is going at the fbi these are unbelievable americans these are unbelievable people they could not believe and for the attorney general to meet in the back of an airport  with bill clinton just prior to making this totally phony decision  this totally disgusting phony decision  to meet in the back of an airplane because he just happened to be there  he just happened he just happened to be  he was in arizona  a place that i love and a place that were going to win big by the way you watch   because they like having borders they are getting inundated with drugs but it was in arizona  now do you know how hot it was that day it was so hot so he was there to play golf he said right but you happen to see   oh its the attorney general gee thats  what a coincidence let me go in through the back of the plane see that plane and other planes that ive had over the years  ive never had anyone like oh i see someone on the runway oh let them in for a little while lets chat never anybody in years and years so she let him in oh come on in hi how you doing hows everything they talked about grandchildren and  what else  they talked about golf now  minutes is a long time lets figure you talk about the grandchildren for  and the golf for   he probably gets up and shows his swing or something right you dont have any room in the plane thats the problem not on that plane  no im only kidding  but tell me  then he left and nobody saw him on the golf course by the way isnt it shocking he didnt get to play i guess folks whats happening to our country is a disgrace its never happened before and in fact she lied in front of congress to such an extent  and ill tell you what im very disappointed in congress both republican and democrat that they dont find a way to do something  because they give the information to the department of justice they give the information that she lied to the fbi and she could do whatever she wants to do and theyre not going to prosecute her because its a total fix and its a disgrace  this corruption is just one more reason why i will ask my attorney general to appoint a special prosecutor  and furthermore  furthermore we are going to investigate this phony investigation its a phony investigation hillary clinton  please you know how expensive  it is nobody ever heard of it i have people very sophisticated in the world of emails and all of these things  they never even heard of the bleaching the reason they did it  its an unbelievably expensive process hillary clinton bleached and deleted  emails after a congressional subpoena so she gets a subpoena  she gets a subpoena and after  not before that wouldnt  be bad but after getting a subpoena to give over your emails and lots of other things she deleted the e mails she has to go to jail    and her law firm which is a very big and powerful law firm which is the one that said oh theyll determine what theyre giving   those representatives within that law firm that did that have to go to jail  she then had  telephones  and many of them were hammered dead now how many people have gotten rid of a cell phone and hammered the hell of it how i need hands up please hands up did anybody hammer  uh oh he did whats your business oh is he in the mob whats your business these are illegal acts you know if you do this privately its a criminal act and look at what happened  look at what happened to other people like general petraeus for doing a tiny fraction their lives have been destroyed shes running for president and shes being protected and these people the most dishonest people other than hillary that you have these people are protecting her because without the press she is nothing she is nothing  and this has been her whole life from  making one of the great returns  ever because it was done dishonestly to whitewater everything has been the lies  but more importantly take a look at her deals libya syria isis look at what happened  she wanted to get rid of isis when she was in isis didnt exist essentially she created the vacuum for isis the emails also show how the clintons ripped off the wonderful people of  doing favors for their friends and special interest  look at  coming back  that woman was out cold and now shes coming back  see   we dont go by these new and very much softer nfl rules  concussion a little ding on the head no you cant play for the rest of the season our people are tough  so americans honestly ive had it with the years and decades of clinton corruption  this corruption this will finally be the year the american people can say enough is enough enough is enough  the clintons are a very dishonest and very bad pairing i mean bill clinton was impeached for lying he totally lied he lost his law license remember this you know some people thought hillary was smart i dont think shes smart look how badly she performed in the last debate  look i thought she was terrible now look look look at how badly she performed she went to washington dc she took her bar exam and she failed right oh shes a genius  she failed the bar exam  theyll go and check it but trust me folks she failed her bar exam she couldnt pass it so she went someplace else and got her license to hurt people the clintons in  the past  we as a group as a movement  we are leaders here  were going to be the future    if we had a little  if we had a little help  from our very weak leadership from the  republican leadership we would be sailing  like weve never sailed  before these are weak people the new  emails also show members of the clinton team viciously attacking catholics and evangelicals  no the press doesnt want to report that one that could be a  its just the latest evidence of the hatred that the clinton campaign has for every day faithful americans if youre a person of faith i think youre going to vote for donald trump and i have such   hillary clinton   so do you believe the last  days five to six of these a day  i may be limping over the finish line but were going to get to that side  now the press will report  the press this dishonest group of   heres what the press will report he said that he was going to limp over the line come on paul you can do better carl you can do better campaign carl hillary clinton thinks youre deplorable and irredeemable  i call you hardworking american patriots and together we are going to save our country  these emails also reveal that crooked hillary clinton believes in global governance unlimited immigration  there goes your country  and worldwide corporations speaking in a select group  to a foreign bank hillary clinton said my dream is a hemispheric common market there goes your  there go the rest of your jobs with open trade and totally open borders ok thats good ok no more country you know what i want to have free trade too but i want to have smart trade we have trade where we benefit for a change because we have lost our jobs we have lost our money we owe  trillion   we dont make our product anymore   we will build the wall  and mexico will pay for the wall  percent  percent  one hundred percent great people i met with the president of mexico month and a half ago    i thought this was set up by the presidential commission on debates so why dont you  why dont you  those guys are talk about a mic that didnt work in the first debate you know what they said the head guy came over and i said my mic wasnt working why didnt you fix it he said we knew it didnt work but we wanted to find out so as soon as the debate was over we wanted to find out what the problem  oh thanks a lot i appreciate it  we dont care if we stand in the rain do we   ill take my hat off ill get my hair nice and wet  thats the end of this suit thats ok behind closed doors when she thought no one was listening she pledged to dissolve the borders of the united states of america hillary wants to end forever the american independence that our soldiers fought for and died for to keep and protect us we will never surrender the freedom and sovereignty of the united states of america  a trump administration will secure and defend our borders without borders we dont have a country under the obamaclinton policies illegal immigrants simply show up at the border and theyre released into the united states and thats why the border patrol agents in ice are so upset and it could be so easy for them but these are great americans they want to do it right and they know that what were doing and who were allowing into our country is wrong and bad for our country ive met the family of sarah root an unbelievable young girl killed the day after graduating from college with a  grade average  the top of her class her killer was released by obama meaning the obama representatives at the border she should have been held the killer should have been held released against the will of agents by a policy thats sick and weak and disgusting released went on to kill and kill again and kill again and hillary wants to go even further the ice officers who endorsed me their first endorsement ever said that hillarys plan is the most radical immigration proposal in united states history hillary also wants to increase syrian refugees by  percent over obama  think of it obamas letting em in by the thousands by the way this guy only does is campaign he is the worst this  even though she admitted in private according to wikileaks  i  dont you wish the press would pick up wikileaks and report it  what  what they said about the justice department what they said about catholics what they said about evangelicals they must be dying watching this but you know what they know its ok cause they know its not gonna be properly reported  but she knows the terrorists are trying to infiltrate through the refugee program she said that she knows thats gonna happen and yet the refugees she wants to pour in the terrorists have already infiltrated our country there are now  open isis investigations in all  states attack after attack including the recent terrorist strikes in new jersey and new york minnesota that were made possible by our extremely open and extremely weak immigration system the orlando terrorist was the son of a taliban supporter who sat right behind hillary during a speech from afghanistan the examples go on and on the shooter in san bernardino the killer who slaughtered four marines in chattanooga tennessee the recent mall shooter in washington state were all admitted by authorities into the united states they should never have been allowed to come in to our country  so let me state this clearly i am going to keep radical islamic terrorists the hell out of our country  at the same time were going to completely rebuild our very dilapidated  look our military its in such  these are the greatest people on earth our military is completely  were gonna rebuild our military that includes building a state of the art missile defense system we are going to be protected we are going to be strong we are going to be strong we are going to take care of our great veterans our veterans have been horribly treated  when it comes to keeping america safe i believe in three very important words peace through strength  but a strong country  we have to be a rich country sad a woman came up she said mr trump that doesnt sound nice sorry folks we want to protect your social security we want to protect your medicare she wont be able to do it hillary doesnt have a clue take a look at what she did to new york state she said she was going to bring  jobs to upstate new york it was a total disaster people poured out of new york they poured out of upstate new york i am going to make america rich again the paris climate deal  and i believe so much in the environment believe it or not people are shocked  ive won many environmental awards many but the paris deal supported by hillary will cost our country another  trillion over a period of time and skyrocket electricity prices in a very great state thats my second home whats that state  we will cancel this deal so that our companies can compete and again we want clean beautiful air and we want crystal clear water thats what we want and we want to be able to do business throughout the world not so that we cant compete because of these crazy deals that our president is making we are going to unlock the  trillion in energy reserves right here under your feet in america  this means many new jobs in florida and all across america that also means cheaper energy for our farmers cheaper energy for everybody were going to take care of florida farmers and florida agriculture and were going to take care of our steelworkers who are under siege from china and were going to take care of our miners who are practically being put out of business  the obamaclinton crew spent  billion on climate programs when they should have used that money to help florida farmers fight diseases that threaten your crops and thats happening all over and by the way when clinton was secretary of state missing missing or gone nobody can figure it out  maybe someday they will and maybe theyll never find it  missing six billion dollars  oh but shell be a wonderful president shes going to be  shell be a wonderful president remember isis  here was isis when she started now isis is in  different countries and now she stands up i will fight isis very hard  youre funny were going to fight isis very very hard there was no isis she created the vacuum along with our incompetent president she created the vacuum and isis formed this money should have been invested in infrastructure like the hoover dam a trump administration will invest in projects like dams and railroads and fast trains and grids our electrical grid is obsolete and dangerous we will return the epa to its core mission that same clean air and clean water that i just mentioned and that means the water for lakeland and we have to remember that right  unless you dont want this everybody likes clean water maybe  maybe and we could save a couple of bucks let it be dirty just for lakeland no no ok well i promise it will be crystal clear crystal clear ok  just  im just testing you im just testing i thought maybe you wouldnt mind we could save a couple of bucks for the country ok  at the center of our  and thats very true yes at the center of our economic revival well be fixing our terrible trade deals when i announced i was running who knew this was going to happen remember all of these guys they cant believe whats going on ill tell you these crooked people back there they cannot believe it  remember remember this guy charles krauthammer where he goes well donald trump has not done this he has no chance oh really   i have a lot of friends who made a lot of money betting because when they had me down to three percent i had a friend  hes one of the smartest guys in business he said you know what donald in all fairness ill bet on you at three percent any time that made a lot of money  but one by one we knocked them off right i knocked them off for you the movement knocked them off  one by one by one by one governors there was a time when i was three or four months into it where it said trump has four months of experience and all of the people hes running against have  years so its four months versus  years and here we are folks  you see because as ive always said experience is very important but competence is much more important ive always said that i know  fortyseven million americans are in poverty and  million americans are on food stamps this is the legacy of obamaclinton my economic agenda will take in the opposite direction and it can be summed up in three such beautiful beautiful words jobs jobs jobs  the great state of florida my state your state has lost one in four manufacturing jobs since nafta signed by bill clinton  the single worst trade deal ever signed ever negotiated in the history of the world ok not here  in the history of the world you look at new england you look at florida you look at pennsylvania ohio michigan  poor michigan ive been fighting for michigan and they dont listen but now theyre going to listen because im going to bring the auto industry back to michigan ive been talking about it for a long time  so her husband signs nafta naftas a disaster hillary clintons south korea deal was supposed to be wonderful for the united states great it was great for south korea for the united states we lost at least  jobs since china entered the world trade organization another bill and hillary backed disaster  factories have shut down or left the united states so when i saw that number i said wait a minute go back its a mistake cant be seven  maybe  maybe  cant be  ready  factories  now that wont fact check oh it was   these people are the worst seventy thousand i really thought theyd made a mistake thats  factories closing a day on average we have real geniuses in washington dont we were living through the greatest jobs theft in the history of the world this is the greatest jobs theft in the history of our world  and boy is it going to change fast folks boy is it going  you know we have people here today who made more money  years ago than theyre making now they had one job instead of two and they were a lot younger so theyre older they make less and they have two and three jobs supposed to be the other way but i always say youre working harder now than you ever did before and youre older well im working harder now than i ever did before and im older too so i dont feel sorry for you  companies like carrier general electric motorola mattel fiat and chrysler and so many other are moving their jobs to mexico and other places and now florida has just announced its moving all of its small car production to mexico  if and when i win we are going to renegotiate the disaster known as nafta were going to renegotiate  and if we dont get the deal we want we will terminate nafta we will get out of nafta well start all over again and believe me were going to make some great deals and i do believe  i believe totally in free trade but its got to be fair trade its got to be trade when like some  lets  lets let some of the crumbs come our way you know what we get we get the drugs and the unemployment mexico gets the jobs the factories the money the income we get the drugs they get the cash oh isnt that wonderful our youth is being poisoned our people are being poisoned with the drugs that are pouring across that border were going to end that very fast  we will also stop the transpacific partnership the deal that hillary clinton in the debate swore that  she said i never said that there was a gold standard the crazy fact checkers said i was right i cant believe it she did say  and you know what if she ever got into that deal nothings as bad as nafta but that deal will be  trust that will take a lot of your jobs out of florida that will take a lot of your jobs out of everywhere but it will take a lot of your florida jobs the backers of that deal have donated heavily to hillary clinton and they want her to get that deal approved its a very bad deal for our country its going to take more jobs its a very very bad deal tpp hopefully im there i will end it so fast and well make deals with individual countries not this big web of complicated stuff over  pages that nobody from our country even reads  dont forget obamacare thousands and thousands of pages and in congress i think they said almost nobody even read it and thats why  look it was a disaster anyway whether they read it or not but tpp is great for other countries but bad for us well do it nice and simple we like a country more   whether they read it or not but tpp is great for other countries but bad for us well do it nice and simple we like a country boom we do a trading deal another one we do a trading deal another one and if they dont behave and if they dont live up to the deal we send them whats called a notice of termination  days its a  day notice of termination and believe me they will come back so fast sir mr president is there a way i can make this deal better for our country ill say yes well do it but were going to make it even better now ok but we have a nice simple pad not this crazy web  did you ever see this tpp theyve got arrows all over the place going to different countries we will be free traders but we will free trade with our friends we will be smart we will be smart and well bring back jobs and well begin making product again well begin making things my dream as president one of many will be to have apple and companies like apple start to make their iphones and other products in the united states not in china and vietnam and all of the other countries theyre making them in  hillary clinton is an insider she fights for herself im an outsider  used to be an insider to be honest with you ok i know the inside and i know the outside and thats why im the only one that can fix this mess folks believe me  i know the inside very well and you know what its a lot easier from my position being on the inside but i felt i had to do this this country has been great to me its been great to my family and i felt i had to do this and the fact that i know  who is more of an insider than me in all fairness nobody practically nobody so i know it from the inside and i know it from the outside and the outside is a lot tougher but i owe it to my country and i know i really owe it we have such great people in this country were going to fix this country were going to get rid of these corrupt politicians  and were going to do it right by the time i finish ill have over  million into my campaign think of that thats a lot of money financed the primaries financed this  we have a lot of money coming in from the small donors it never happened to a republican before where they have this kind of money small donors average  but you know what its so important and one of these characters said it doesnt matter if you win or lose because what youve done has never been done in the history of this country meaning this great movement  look at the people where they are they did let some of those people in thats fantastic thank you  look at that look where that guy is but you know what we are going to do things and its so important and i said it does matter whether we win or lose and let me tell you if i dont win on november th he said youll go down in history now bernie wont go down in history you know why because he made a deal with the devil had bernie not made that deal he would have gone down as a major footnote in political history bernie sold out to the devil he sold out to the devil i mean his ideas are different than our ideas other than he knew we were being ripped off on trade which hes right about but we can fix it he couldnt but bernie sanders sold out to the devil and hes gone and now when he goes and speaks nobody shows up anymore sad we cant let that happen to us but i said to this pundit i said no youre wrong if i lose i will consider it the biggest waste of time energy and money that ive ever done in my entire life true so im not controlled by the special interests youre my only special interest folks im telling you  its the peoples voice be heard and on november th the whole world is going to hear your voice and the whole world is going to see whats going to happen in the united states of america  theyre going to hear you say that its time to put america first once more  were going to start making things again in our country and part of our plan to bring back our jobs were going to lower your business tax from  percent to  percent new companies forget  it for them  people are going to get jobs you saw the last jobs report was a disaster i said that cant be the last one before the election they said no theres another one then they came back and said no sir we made a mistake thats the last jobs take a look at the jobs report that came out last week it is a disaster take a look at gdp were at one percent if china was at one percent it would be a national disaster they go to seven and eight and nine percent and they consider it horrible we go to one percent and we just keep going along folks that means were literally going in the wrong direction were also going to fix our inner cities its so important to me and were going to help our african american great people  and our hispanic american great people fortyfive percent of african american youth live in poverty african americans have a really horrible loan rate of home ownership far lower than the rest of the population not good  percent fiftyeight percent of african american youth dont have jobs more than  people have been shot in chicago since the beginning of the year you dont hear these people back here they dont want you to hear because they want crooked hillary to get in  we have  wait  we have the highest murder rate in this country in  years more people are being murdered now than being murdered in  years so you look at our inners cities  you look at our inner cities the education is no good the schools are horrible they educations a disaster people are being shot walking to the grocery store their kids are being killed its a disaster theres no jobs and theres no hope and then for years the democrats have wrought the inner cities without abate seventyfive years   years so heres what i said we ought to fix the inner cities ive look at african americans and i say what the hell do you have to lose were going to fix it were going to fix it i promise    thats so cool i didnt tell them thats cool but listen what do we have to lose what do you have to lose is it going to get worse look at the crime rate look at the  the education look at the jobs the jobs are nonexistent same thing for hispanic americans you take a look at what theyre going through and its so unfair and i see all these women for trump signs i love this i dont   women for trump i dont get these polls every place i go i see hundreds of women for trump and then i see a poll hes not doing well with women i dont know i dont know you know my daughter ivanka she wants child care and she can care all of them but you know women want safety for our country they want a strong military they dont want crime in our cities they want to be protected by law and order they want law and order the women in this country want what im saying and we are really  i think were saying it very strong so to the african americans i say i will fix it to the hispanic americans i say i will fix it i will fight for you harder than anybody has ever fought for you thats all of you thats all of you thats everybody  we are going to make america strong again we are going to make america safe again we are going to make america rich again and we are going to make america great again thank you god bless you everybody god bless you god bless you"
88,"Trump","thank you  thank you very much thank you folks  thank you folks its great to be right here in florida which we love  in  days we are going to win this great great state and we are going to win the white house  our movement is about replacing a failed and corrupt  now when i say corrupt im talking about totally corrupt  political establishment with a new government controlled by you the american people  there is nothing the political establishment will not do  no lie that they wont tell to hold their prestige and power at your expense and thats whats been happening  the washington establishment and the financial and media corporations that fund it exist for only one reason to protect and enrich itself  the establishment has trillions of dollars at stake in this election as an example just one single trade deal theyd like to pass involves trillions of dollars controlled by many countries corporations and lobbyists for those who control the levers of power in washington and for the global special interests they partner with these people that dont have your good in mind our campaign represents a true existential threat like they havent seen before  this is not simply another fouryear election this is a crossroads in the history of our civilization that will determine whether or not we the people reclaim control over our government  the political establishment that is trying to stop us is the same group responsible for our disastrous trade deals massive illegal immigration and economic and foreign policies that have bled our country dry  the political establishment has brought about the destruction of our factories and our jobs as they flee to mexico china and other countries all around the world our justannounced job numbers are anemic our gross domestic product or gdp is barely above  percent and going down workers in the united states are making less than they were almost  years ago and yet they are working harder but so am i working harder that i can tell you  its a global power structure that is responsible for the economic decisions that have robbed our working class stripped our country of its wealth and put that money into the pockets of a handful of large corporations and political entities just look at what this corrupt establishment has done to our cities like detroit flint michigan and rural towns in pennsylvania ohio north carolina and all across our country take a look at whats going on they stripped away these town bare and raided the wealth for themselves and taken our jobs away out of our country never to return unless im elected president  the clinton machine is at the center of this power structure weve seen this first hand in the wikileaks documents in which hillary clinton meets in secret with international banks to plot the destruction of us sovereignty in order to enrich these global financial powers her special interest friends and her donors  so true   honestly she should be locked up  should be locked up  and likewise the emails show that the clinton machine is so closely and irrevocably tied to the media organizations that she  that she  listen to this  is given the questions and answers in advance of her debate performance with bernie sanders  hillary clinton is also given approval and veto power over quotes written about her in the new york times  they definitely do not do that to me that i can tell you  and the emails show the reporters collaborate and conspire directly with the clinton campaign on helping her win the election all over  with their control over our government at stake with trillions of dollars on the line the clinton machine is determined to achieve the destruction of our campaign not gonna to happen  which has now become a great great movement the likes of which our country has never seen before never ever  theyve never seen a movement like this in our country before yesterday in florida massive crowds people lined up outside of big arenas not able to get in never happened before its one of the phenomenas  its one of the great political phenomenas the most powerful weapon deployed by the clintons is the corporate media the press  lets be clear on one thing the corporate media in our country is no longer involved in journalism theyre a political special interest no different than any lobbyist or other financial entity with a total political agenda and the agenda is not for you its for themselves  and their agenda is to elect crooked hillary clinton at any cost at any price no matter how many lives they destroy  for them its a war and for them nothing at all is out of bounds this is a struggle for the survival of our nation believe me and this will be our last chance to save it on november th remember that  this election will determine whether we are a free nation or whether we have only the illusion of democracy but are in fact controlled by a small handful of global special interests rigging the system and our system is rigged this is reality you know it they know it i know it and pretty much the whole world knows it the establishment and their media enablers will control over this nation through means that are very well known anyone who challenges their control is deemed a sexist a racist a xenophobe and morally deformed  they will attack you they will slander you they will seek to destroy your career and your family they will seek to destroy everything about you including your reputation they will lie lie lie and then again they will do worse than that they will do whatever is necessary the clintons are criminals remember that theyre criminals   this is well documented and the establishment that protects them has engaged in a massive coverup of widespread criminal activity at the state department and the clinton foundation in order to keep the clintons in power  never in history have we seen such a coverup as this one that includes the total destruction of  emails  iphones some by hammer laptops missing boxes of evidence and many many other things people who are capable of such crimes against our nation are capable of anything and so now we address the slander and libels that was just last night thrown at me by the clinton machine and the new york times and other media outlets as part of a concerted coordinated and vicious attack its not coincidence that these attacks come at the exact same moment and all together at the same time as wikileaks releases documents exposing the massive international corruption of the clinton machine including  more emails just this morning  these vicious claims about me of inappropriate conduct with women are totally and absolutely false  and the clintons know it and they know it very well these claims are all fabricated theyre pure fiction and theyre outright lies these events never ever happened and the people said them meekly fully understand you take a look at these people you study these people and youll understand also  the claims are preposterous ludicrous and defy truth common sense and logic we already have substantial evidence to dispute these lies and it will be made public in an appropriate way and at an appropriate time very soon  these lies come from outlets whose past stories and past claims have already been discredited the media outlets did not even attempt to confirm the most basic facts because even a simple investigation would have shown that these were nothing more than false smears  six months ago the failing new york times wrote a massive story attacking me and the central witness they used said the story was false that she was quoted inaccurately she said that i was a great guy she had great courage ill be honest with you she was an amazing person and never made those remarks  that i was a great guy and never made the remarks  and when i read the story i was sort of surprised  how could she say that and she didnt say it we demanded a retraction but they refused to print it just like they refused to pin the comments from another source who praised me in her book or the words of another wonderful woman who said really nice things about me they put other statements that she didnt say they misrepresented the story was a fraud and a big embarrassment to the new york times and it was a big front page story front page center color picture a disgrace they were very embarrassed it will be part of the lawsuit we are preparing against them  now today the same two discredited writers who shouldve been fired from the new york times for what the did tell another totally fabricated and false story that supposedly took place on an airplane more than  years ago another ridiculous tale no witnesses no nothing then there was a writer from people magazine who wrote a story on melania and myself on our first anniversary the story was beautiful it was beautiful it was lovely but last night we hear that after  years  this took place  years ago this story  a new claim that i made inappropriate advances during the interview to this writer  and i asked very simple question why wasnt it part of the story that appeared  or  years ago why wasnt it a part of the story why didnt they make it part of the story i was one of the biggest stars on television with the apprentice and i wouldve been one of the biggest stories of the year think of it shes doing this story on melania who was pregnant at the time and donald trump our one year anniversary and she said i made inappropriate advances and by the way the area was a public area people all over the place take a look you take a look look at her look at her words you tell me what you think i dont think so  i dont think so  but it is amazing doing a story  a love story  on how great we are together  and by the way were stronger today than we ever were before which is good but  its a love story  its a love story on our one year and if i did that she wouldve added that it wouldve been the headline and who wouldve done that if youre doing this and youre one of the tops shows on television these people are horrible people theyre horrible horrible liars and interestingly it happens to appear  days before our very important election isnt that amazing  this invented account has already been debunked by eyewitnesses who were there  they were there the very witness identified by the author has said the story is totally false by the way this is a room that everybody can see in its got glass walls its at maralago its got glass walls can you believe this why wasnt it in the story biggest story of the year this weekend the new york times published a fullpage hit piece with another claim from an individual who has been totally discredited based on the many many many emails and letters she has sent to our office over the years looking for work donald is great wanting go to my rallies but the new york times  and this was full oped piece  refused to use the evidence that we presented  refused to use it if they used it if they would have looked they would have said theres no story here others in the media which almost surprises me because theyre dishonest also were presented with the story by this woman numerous times and they got very excited but after seeing the evidence that we immediately give them all of them refused to write the story there was no story the times though didnt want to see it they just wrote the story and this was a full page opposite the editorials this is part of a concerted effort led by the new york times and others now the new york times is fighting desperately for its relevance and its financial survival and it probably wont even be around in a few years based on its financial outlook which wouldnt be a bad thing if you want to know the truth  but as it winds down its years and is becoming more and more problematic its gotten more and more vicious more and more vile and even the other mainstream media is talking about the single greatest pile on in history and all between now and november th and you have to see the stories theyve written its one after another after another and facts mean nothing thirdrate journalism the great editors of the past from the new york times and others ladies and gentlemen are spinning in their grave i will not allow the clinton machine to turn our campaign into a discussion of their slanders and lies but will remain focused on the issues facing the american people    thank you thank you but let me state this as clearly as i can these attacks are orchestrated by the clintons and their media allies the only thing hillary clinton has going for herself is the press without the press she is absolutely zero  and you saw that the other night in the debate where some people said she made virtually a fool of herself this is not presidential material believe me what they say is false and slanderous in virtually every respect we are now less than a month from the most election of our lifetime indeed one of the most important elections in the history of our country and the polls are showing us in a dead heat dont believe what you say  the new highly respected rasmussen poll just came out this morning just released shows up nationally  points ahead trump beautiful   just came out so now the clinton machine has put forward a small handful of people out of tens of thousands of people over the years that ive met that ive worked with that ive employed in order to make wild and false allegations that fail to meet even the most basic test of common sense not even common sense again this is nothing more than an attempt to destroy our movement and for the clintons to keep their corrupt control over our government when i declared my candidacy i knew what bad shape our country was in and believe me all you have to do is look at world events all you have to do is look at the  billion that we sent to iran in cash in cash  all you have to do is see the way isis was created in the vacuum left by hillary clinton and barack obama out of iraq all you have to do all you have to do is look at the  people that were very very not good for our nation they were going to be deported lo and behold instead of being deported they were made citizens of the united states just recently  and lo and behold sadly the  people is wrong it turned out to be close to  people our president is incompetent all he wants to do is campaign and the last thing he wants to happen is to have donald trump terminate obamacare and do all of the other things that are destroying   hes led a very divided nation and its only gotten worse and the last thing our country needs is four more years of barack obama believe me ive seen first hand the corruption and the sickness that has taken over our politics youve seen it and ive seen it and were all watching together they knew they would throw every lie they could at me and my family and my loved ones they knew they would stop at nothing to try to stop me but i never knew as bad as it would be i never knew it would be this vile that it would be this bad that it would be this vicious nevertheless i take all of these slings and arrows gladly for you  i take them for our movement so that we can have our country back our great civilization here in america and across the civilized world has come upon a moment of reckoning weve seen it in the united kingdom where they voted to liberate themselves from global government and global trade deal and global immigration deals that have destroyed their sovereignty and have destroyed many of those nations but the central base of world political power is right here in america and it is our corrupt political establishment that is the greatest power behind the efforts at radical globalization and the disenfranchisement of working people their financial resources are virtually unlimited their political resources are unlimited their media resources are unmatched and most importantly the depths of their immorality is absolutely unlimited  they will allow radical islamic terrorists to enter our country by the thousands  they will allow the great trojan horse  and i dont want people looking back in a hundred years and  years and have that story be told about us because we were led by inept incompetent and corrupt people like barack obama and like hillary clinton we dont want to be part of that history  and by the way president obama should stop campaigning and start working on creating jobs start working on getting our gdp up start working on strengthening our borders  the corrupt political establishment is a machine it has no soul i knew these false attacks would come i knew this day would arrive its only a question of when and i knew the american people would rise above it and vote for the future they deserve  the only thing that can stop this corrupt machine is you the only force strong enough to save our country is us the only people brave enough to vote out this corrupt establishment is you the american people  we are going to have a policy america first    they control incredibly the department of justice  and they even secretly meet with the attorney general of the united states  in the back of her airplane while on the runway  remember he was there  he was going to play golf theres the attorney general let me go say hello  planes on the runway let me go say hello to the attorney general he never got to play golf i understand and it was arizona a place i love but the weather was about a hundred and some odd degrees  hes not gonna play he was never there to play golf folks dont be foolish they met for  minutes and most likely it was to discuss her re appointment in a clinton administration as the attorney general just prior to making a decision over whether or not to prosecute hillary clinton ok thats what happened thats called real life and thats pretty sad  they met for  minutes remember he said we talked golf and we talked about our grandchildren  three minutes for the grandchildren two minutes for the golf then they sat there and they twiddled their thumbs now i believe they talked about her remaining in her position under a crooked hillary clinton administration thats what i believe  thats what i believe folks thats what i believe and i think thats what most people in this room believe  likewise theyve essentially corrupted the director of the fbi to the point at which stories are already saying that the great  and they are truly great  men and women who work for the fbi are embarrassed and ashamed of what hes done to one of our truly great institutions the fbi itself  hillary clinton is guilty of all the things that director comey stated at his press conference and congressional hearings and far more he stated many things but its far more and he knows that and yet after reading all of these items where shes so guilty he let her off the hook while other lives including general petraeus and many others have been destroyed for doing far far less this is a conspiracy against you the american people and we cannot let this happen or continue  this is our moment of reckoning as a society and as a civilization itself i didnt need to do this folks believe me  believe me i built a great company and i had a wonderful life i could have enjoyed the fruits and benefits of years of successful business deals and businesses for myself and my family instead of going through this absolute horror show of lies deceptions malicious attacks  who would have thought im doing it because this country has given me so much and i feel so strongly that its my turn to give back to the country that i love  many of my friends and many political experts warned me that this campaign would be a journey to hell said that but theyre wrong it will be a journey to heaven because we will help so many people that are so desperately in need of help  in my former life i was in insider as much as anybody else and i knew what its like and i still know what its like to be an insider its not bad its not bad now im being punished for leaving the special club and revealing to you the terrible things that are going on having to do with our country because i used to be part of the club im the only one that can fix it  im doing this for the people and for the movement and we will take back this country for you and we will make america great again  the corrupt establishment knows that we are a great threat to their criminal enterprise they know that if we win their power is gone and its returned to you the people will be the dark clouds hanging over our government can be lifted and replaced with a bright future but it all depends on whether we let the corrupt media decide our future or whether we let the american people decide our future  if this clinton campaign of destruction is allowed to work then no other highly success  and this is so true  i mean ive seen this so many times and ive heard this all of my life  ive heard it all of my life if we let this happen then no other highly successful person which is what our country needs  it needs a certain thinking when you look at our trade deals that are so bad when you look as an example on trade were going to lose almost  billion this year trade deficit almost  billion our debt has doubled in seven and a half years to almost  trillion under obama  no other successful person after watching this and no other very successful person will ever again ever  and who can blame them even me id say youre right  will ever again run for office ive heard it for years if youre very successful you cant run for high office especially for president i said i dont care i dont care ive done so many deals ive done so well its a certain mindset that we need in our country at least for a period of time we have to straighten our country out  i will not lie to you these false attacks are absolutely hurtful to be lied about to be slandered to be smeared so publicly and before your family that you love is very painful what is going on is egregious beyond any words people that know the story people that see the story people that know the facts they cant even believe it its reprehensible beyond description its totally corrupt but i also know that its not about me its about all of you and its about our country i know that i fully understand that thats why i got involved its about all of us together as a country its a movement the likes of which we have never in history in this country seen before never in history even the pundits even the media  that truly dislikes donald trump for their own reasons  will admit this is a movement the likes of which people have never seen before and its a movement about the veterans who need medical care  the mothers whove lost their beloved children to terrorism and to crime its about the inner cities and the border towns who desperately need our help its about the millions of jobless people in america its about the american workers who cant get jobs because our jobs have left for mexico and so many other countries  this election is about the people being crushed by obamacare and its about defeating isis and appointing a supreme court and a supreme court justice  it could be four or five  who will defend and protect our constitution  this election is also about so importantly to me african american and hispanicamerican people whose communities have been plunged into crime poverty and failing schools by the policies of crooked hillary clinton believe me shes crooked  theyve robbed these citizens of their future and if we win i will give them their hope their jobs their education i will give them their security back the inner cities education is almost worthless its horrible were going to have common core ended  were going to bring education local  but you look at the inner cities and you see bad education no jobs no safety you walk to the grocery store with your child and you get shot you walk outside to look and see whats happening and you get shot in chicago  people have been shot since january st were not going to let that happen our inner cities are almost at an alltime low run by the democrats for sometimes more than a hundred years chain unbroken  so they have no jobs they have horrible education they have no safety or security and i say to the africanamerican community what the hell do you have to lose i will fix it  i will fix it i will make it good ill bring back our jobs well have good education well have great safety in the inner city  and we will help the hispanicamerican people who have been treated so badly and so unfairly in our nation we will help them  i will deliver like youve never seen before i deliver whether people like donald trump or not they all say he delivers  vote for donald trump youre going to see something and youll be so happy youll be so thrilled this election is about every man woman and child in our country who deserves to live in safety prosperity and peace so true we will rise above the lies the smears the ludicrous slanders from ludicrous and very very dishonest reporters  we will vote for the country we want we will vote for the future we want we will vote for the politics we want and we will vote to put this corrupt government cartel out of business and out of business immediately  we will vote for the special interests and say lots of luck but youre being voted out of power theyve betrayed our workers theyve betrayed our borders and most of all theyve betrayed our freedoms we will save our sovereign rights as a nation we will end the politics of profit we will end the rule of special interests we will end the raiding of our jobs by other countries we will end the total disenfranchisement of the american voter and the american worker our independence day is at hand and it arrives finally on november th  join me in taking back our country and creating a bright glorious and prosperous new future for our people we will make america great again and it will happen quickly god bless you god bless you thank you thank you"

country dry were losing our jobs  were going to renegotiate our disastrous trade deals and illegal immigration stop the massive inflow of refugees take care of our vets our great vets and were going

leaving our country under a trump administration theyll be staying right here and believe me there are plenty of them right now negotiating to leave i hate to tell you that these are the issues that well discuss at the next debate which i look very much forward to  crooked hillary is doing no more public events until after the debate they say shes doing debate prep but really shes just resting shes resting   for what  for what shes done they should lock her up they should its disgraceful honestly its disgraceful whats going on in our country right now is a disgrace the hillary clinton documents released by wikileaks make more clear than ever just how much is at stake on november the th wikileaks released new clinton campaign emails revealing how friendly hillary was with the attorney general loretta lynch this was only months prior to lynchs investigation of hillarys illegal secret email server that gave foreign governments access to our confidential information  this comes on the heels of disclosure that clinton campaign was conspiring and colluding with the state department and justice department over the release of her emails and the investigation into her server hillary clinton told the fbi  times she couldnt remember anything i couldnt remember i couldnt remember or recall key events concerning illegal server and related misconduct now in new written testimony just out as part freedom of information act request hillary clinton said she couldnt remember recall or anything else key events and key things  different times  its one more reason that if i win i will ask my attorney general to appoint a special prosecutor  and we also have to investigate the investigation itself  hillary bleached and deleted  emails after a congressional subpoena she got a subpoena from congress and she said this is no good this is terrible because those  emails had bad stuff and she said get rid of them delete them bleach them nobody bleaches because thats an expensive process she bleached get rid of them and then she made everybody get rid of iphones her iphones and some of them were hammered they were hammered to death all to cover up her crimes yesterday new disclosures were made showing again how hillary clintons pay for play works saudi arabia paid bill clinton a lot of money to make a speech and then got an arms deal from hillary and her state department that they were unable to get the nation of qatar also kicked in  million for bill clintons birthday party so nice but as wikileaks showed the clintons ripped off the people of haiti as they were suffering and dying after the earthquake and her brothers on the board of a gold mine her brother but the medias covering up for the clintons and their many crimes against so many people the wikileaks documents show how the media conspires and collaborates with the clinton campaign including giving the questions and answers to hillary clinton before the debate ok  what a rigged system folks last night we had a massive crowd of over  people in cincinnati filled up an arena  and the media wont even talk about the size of the crowd the enthusiasm of the crowd i watched nbc this morning they said last night donald trump was in cincinnati if hillary clinton has  people the crowd is so big  it is horrible  it is really horrible the corrupt media is trying to do everything in their power to stop our movement believe me they dont want this happening we have one of the great movements  we have the great movement we have a movement thats never happened before  and no paper is more corrupt than the failing new york times the good news is it is failing it wont be around too much longer but they are really really bad people the largest shareholder in the times is carlos slim now carlos slim as you know comes from mexico hes given many millions of dollars to the clintons and their initiatives so carlos slim largest owner of the paper from mexico reporters at the new york times theyre not journalists theyre corporate lobbyists for carlos slim and for hillary clinton were going to let foreign corporations and their ceos decide the outcomes of the  you just cant do this we cant let this happen we are not going to let it happen where they decide the outcome of our elections they cant do it and were not going to let it happen this is our last chance to save our country and reclaim it for we the people and its going to happen  oh its going to happen as you have seen right now i am being viciously attacked with lies and smears  its a phony deal i have no idea who these women are have no idea i have no idea and i think you all know i have no idea because you understand me for a lot of years ok  when you looked at that horrible woman last night you said i dont think so i dont think so  whoever she is wherever she comes from the stories are total fiction theyre  percent made up they never happened they never would happen i dont think theyd happen with very many people but they certainly arent going to happen with me folks you know my people always say oh dont talk about it talk about jobs talk about the economy dont worry your jobs are going to be coming back to north carolina like youve seen the economys going to be good  but i feel i have to talk about them because you have to dispute when somebody says something and fortunately we have the microphone were able to dispute some people cant these are lies being pushed by the media and the clinton campaign to try and keep their grip on our country they are all false theyre totally invented fiction all  percent totally and completely fabricated never met this person these people i dont know who they are i dont know who they  think of whats happening to our country think of whats happening i dont know who these people are i look on television i think its a disgusting thing and its being pushed they have no witnesses theres nobody around they just come out some are doing it for probably a little fame they get some free fame its a total setup now suddenly after many many years phony accusers come out less than a month before one of the most important elections in the history of our country it also comes at a time as wikileaks unveils horrible horrible things about hillary clinton  but theyd rather talk about this somebody that youve never seen that said oh  he went like this  one came out recently where i was sitting alone in some club i really dont sit alone that much honestly folks i dont think i sit alone i go in with groups of people  i was sitting alone by myself like this  and then i went whaw  to somebody i just heard this one its like its like unbelievable even a simple investigation wouldve shown these allegations against me in just about all cases its nonsense its false and eyewitnesses already debunked to a people magazine story heres my question about the dishonest writer from people magazine why didnt she write what she said happened before we wrote the story why didnt she put it in the story the story wouldve been one of the big stories i was the big star of the apprentice why didnt she go it  years ago twelve years ago shes writing a story  no think of this think of this shes right shes a liar she is a liar shes writing a story  check our her facebook page youll understand hey shes writing a story about a beautiful love story melania donald and she said i made inappropriate move now just so you understand thats a big story if i did she wrote the most beautiful story honestly the most beautiful story  percent story like beautiful why wouldnt she have put this into the story now two nights ago i get a call oh people magazines doing a story its ok no no its not ok its about a story that was written  years ago she was on last night or one of the top people that people was on and he said no we were just informed of it well did you hear about it  years ago did you hear about five years no no we never  we just heard about it recently these people are sick these people are sick and the reason she didnt write it  years ago is very simple it never happened it never happened its a lie  its a lie and let me tell you if it did happen if it did happen it   percent she would have written it it would have been the biggest story of the year ok these are all horrible lies all fabrications and we cant let them change the most important election in our lifetimes if five percent of the people think its true and maybe  percent think  we dont win in other words they make lies they have people come around oh donald trump did this or that i never saw these people before i dont know who they are and then you watch these phony networks and dishonest networks who are  percent  let me tell you something about hillary clinton shes got nothing going shes got nothing the only thing shes got going is the media shes got nothing going shes got nothing the other day at the debate where by the way i absolutely destroyed her ok  every online poll even time magazine time magazine is not exactly in love with me but every online poll had us skill   she said the other day im standing i told you this but im standing at my podium and she walks in front of me right she walks in front of me you know and when she walked in front of me believe me i wasnt impressed but she walks in front of me and she takes a question then she walked back and that was the end of that no problem  then she said the next day i invaded her space give me a break and i was waiting for that because she had that incident once before where they made up something some guy invaded her space the poor guy lost the election because of it but i was very conscious of this so i purposely i purposely didnt do anything so  get this guy out of here get him out of here out  get out of here    its really total disrespect for the american flag there he is look good great folks  folks thats whats happening to our country thats whats happening that is total disrespect for our flag thats whats happening to our country were going to turn it around folks  were going to turn it around  so  so just to finish up  so just to finish up you see whats happening the process is rigged this whole election is being rigged these lies spread by the media without witnesses without backup or anything else  body makes an accusation that you did something and you werent  you never saw this person before its a lie total lie its fabrication sometimes they do it for fame maybe they get money who knows the clinton campaign is pushing it the new york times did a story on somebody where it was totally false they knew it was totally false we gave them the information they wrote a whole big page about somebody where they were sending me emails and letters and everything and then you realize  it was a oneway send by the way there was nothing sent back  and you realize it was a totally phony deal they did a whole big story on it they didnt mention all of the emails they didnt mention everything coming my way and others looked at it and as bad as it was soon as they saw this stuff that was said they immediately  immediately decided not to do this the new york times did a story on it they read these stories and people might not know how untrue they are its really a disgrace ive been saying this for a long time the whole thing weve been going through and i hate to say it but the whole thing were going through  bernie sanders was a rigged deal  the whole thing is one big fix its one big fix its one big ugly lie its one big fix the press cant write the kind of things they write which are lies lies lies the stories are fabrications and false and the only thing i say is hopefully hopefully our patriotic movement will overcome this terrible deception  hopefully our great movement  and theres never been anything like this in the united states and the only way they figure they can throw it down is to come up with people that are willing to say i was with donald trump in  i was sitting with him on an airplane and he went after me on the plane yeah im going to go after  believe me she would not be my first choice that i can tell you man  you dont know that would not be my first choice hopefully our great movement powered by everyday citizens will overcome the sickness that is plaguing our politics and our media and ill tell you what our media is indeed sick and its making our country sick and were going to stop it  were going to stop it folks all right lets get on now lets get onto another subject but isnt it good that we talk about this right who thinks i shouldnt talk were talk jocks  right who thinks that i shouldnt talk about it does anybody think that ok i agree when somebody you know a long time ago  when you get hit you hit back youve got to do it you dont just say i didnt get hit oh i didnt get hit when you get hit we are destroying our country with these sick people back there and they know it better than anybody in this arena  i ran because i knew what trouble our country was in the country is in tremendous trouble you know this you know this in north carolina because you see whats happening to your jobs theyre disappearing i know its not about me its about you and thats why im doing this i didnt need to do this but its about you its about bringing our country making our country great again im taking these slings and arrows for you so we can have our borders so we can get back our jobs  so we can be a safe nation again you know the murder  the number of murders in our country this year went up more than they have in  years   its true  look obama is an incompetent he is an incompetent president  he doesnt know what hes doing hes out campaigning all day long he talking about me like he knows me i dont know him he doesnt know me  and why doesnt some woman maybe come up and say what they say falsely about me they could say about him they could say it about anybody they could say it about anybody ill tell you what he better be careful because they could say it about anybody anybody at all but obama is in incompetent as a president hes about as bad as it gets look at whats happening how iran is taunting us look at whats going on look at the world he gives away  million in cash but it turns out to  billion in cash gives them  billion  this guys doesnt know what hes doing its an embarrassment if you look at the middle east its a blow up its a total disaster we have an incompetent president i hate to say it but it  percent true and all hes doing instead of working on your jobs and your companies leaving for mexico and other places hes campaigning for crooked hillary thats all he does  either we win this election or were going to lose our country because  more years of obama you cant take it  wikileaks documents hillary clinton speaking in secret  oh man you saw those too  a secret brazilian bank hillary clinton said my dream is a hemisphere common market with open trade and open borders there go the rest of your jobs   there go   even though she doesnt say that but thats what she said in a very very secret meeting the emails show that behind closed doors speaking to these international bankers hillary clintons pledged to destroy the sovereignty of the united states a trump administration will secure and defend our borders than youve ever   and yes we will build a wall  crooked hillary also wants a  percent increase in syrian refugees to pour into our country   and thats  obama numbers and those are thousands and thousands  this  even though she admitted it private according to wikileaks again nobody is covering wikileaks theyre covering somebody that i never saw before that she knows terrorists are trying to infiltrate the refugee program so you have terrorists coming in she knows theyre coming in and yet she wants to increase it    and our country will never be the same so let me state this as clearly as i can i am going to keep radical islamic terrorists the hell out of our country  at the same time were going to take care of our military and were going to take care of our great great great veterans  theyve been treated very badly  that includes  veterans choice so veterans can either attend a public va facility or if they have to wait online like theyve been doing sometimes for as much as seven days and then still not get proper care theyll go to a private medical center or theyll go to a private or public or something they will go outside  theyll go to a private doctor theyll go to a private hospital theyll go to a public hospital were going to get them care and were going to pay for their  that care theyre not going to wait online  for seven days and die sometimes waiting online for a simple simple procedure or prescription its not going to happen like that any longer for our veterans ok not going to happen  and hillary clinton said no no the va is doing a good job ok  north carolina is home to more than  activeduty military personnel and almost  veterans  the military supports over half a million jobs in this state we are going to repeal the obamaclinton defense sequester and we are going to rebuild the military of the united states which is very sadly depleted  when it comes to keeping america safe i believe in a three and  i think you believe in these words i think  three very important words peace through strength right peace through strength  and we dont want to use our strength but you have to have our strength and the world is laughing at us theyre laughing at the stupidity of our president remember he drew the line in the sand  the line is in the sand remember hillary the last debate i wasnt secretary of state then she doesnt even know it turned out she lied remember she said tpp was gold standard she said she never said that during the debate she lied about that shes a liar  but to be a strong country we must also be a very rich country at the center of our economic revival well be fixing our really horrendous oneway street horrible trade deals were going to fix them folks you know last year we lost almost  billion in trade deficits we have trade deficit with other nations of almost  billion and i have some friends in the audience i guarantee i can take any one of those friends  one in particular who happens to be brutal but thats ok lives in north carolina so you know one of those things right but a great business person i put him in charge  this case him  we would have such a good thing and there are people like that we have the greatest negotiators in the world we have the greatest business people in the world we dont use them we use political hacks so we have a trade deficit of almost  billion sad isnt it isnt it pathetic north carolinas industrial  workers have been crushed by bill clintons signing of nafta supported by crooked hillary dont forget a lot of people want that to happen because they make a lot of money by taking money out of this country those deals are very good for a lot of people a lot of people know  everybody knows that nafta is no good for the united states but its good for their wallets in some cases youve lost nearly half of your manufacturing jobs since nafta did you know that youve lost almost half of your manufacturing jobs this region used to be the furniture manufacturing hub of the world i know because i bought plenty but the nafta deal and then chinas entry into the world trade organization another bill and hillary backed disaster have sent those jobs to other countries you know better than anybody i used to be here a lot for furniture gets smaller and smaller every year not going to have anything left pretty soon were living through the greatest jobs theft in the history of the world our jobs have been stolen from us and we have people that dont know what they are doing in particular our leadership if i win day one we are going to announce our plans to renegotiate nafta  if we dont get the deal we want we leave nafta and start over to get a much better a much more fair deal because right now were a oneway highway into mexico a oneway highway   i mean you take a look at this its one way they get the jobs they get the factories they get the cash and all we get  we get illegal immigration and we get drugs and the drugs are poisoning our youth the drugs are poisoning our youth and others but were getting the drugs and were getting lots of problems and ill tell you i was endorsed by the as you know by ice just last week and by the border patrol agents  sixteen thousand five hundred border patrol theyve never  theyve never done this before theyve never done  theyve never endorsed a presidential candidate both groups endorsed me because were going to have strong borders and were going to have people come into our country but theyre going to come in legally legally  and were going to stand up to china were going to stop their currency manipulation and product dumping which is killing us and they dont follow the rules and if they dont were going to institute tariffs when they send something into our country  and believe me theyre going to obey our rules so quickly you have no idea and well end up with a better relationship with china than we do now look what theyre doing theyre building a massive fortress against everything a massive fortress in the south china sea and yet theyre ripping us off now if theyre going to rip us off you wouldnt think theyd be building fortresses they have no respect for our president  which i can understand that  they have no respect for obama they have no respect for our country and theyre getting away with murder and we have the cards we have the cards we have all the cards because were like the piggy bank that everybody keeps stealing from but pretty soon were not going to be piggy bank anymore were going to be the opposite of the piggy bank  we dont have  we are  trillion half of which came during the obama years and yet we didnt fix anything our roads are bad our bridges are bad our tunnels are bad our schools are bad our hospitals are bad were going to start making things again in america as part of our plan to bring back our jobs were going to lower our business tax from  percent to  tax the biggest since ronald reagan  wages will rise jobs will return and factories will come rushing rushing back in to our country were also going to fix our inner cities fortyfive percent of africanamerican children are  under the age six  are living in poverty think of it  percent fiftyeight percent of african american youth dont have jobs more than  people have been shot in chicago since the beginning of the year three thousand people since january three thousand its

amazing things were going to do when we take over hopefully this incredible country and run it properly in  we going to have the biggest tax cut since ronald reagan were going to eliminate jobkilling

vote  in an email sent to john podesta on august   hillary wrote that the governments of qatar and saudi arabia are quote providing clandestine financial and logistical support to isil yet in that same year bill and hillary accepted a check from saudi arabia so hillary thinks that they are funding isis but still takes their money and you know their views on gays and you know their views on women takes a lot of money i think she should give back the  million to  million shes taken from saudi arabia and she should give it back fast  theres a lot of people in here  youre a big group this is a big group  you know i own an big development right down the road trump national right on lake norman lake norman and we have an amazing  its an amazing success we have amazing people there both the employees and the people living there and we love it   thank you thank you  this is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to clinton corruption hillary bleached and deleted  emails after receiving after remember the word after receiving a congressional subpoena and then made  phones disappear   its amazing what shes getting away with right its amazing but maybe that wont happen she made  phones disappear some by beating them beating them beating with a hammer has anybody when you got rid of your iphone knocked the hell out of it with a hammer    theres a person way way in the back we will find out what business that persons in  she did it to cover up her crimes its one more reason why we need a special prosecutor to look into hillary clinton  and we have to investigate the investigation the investigation nobody in this country has seen anything like it this is our last chance to save our country and reclaim it for we the people this is it you dont have another chance i really believe this is it as you have seen i am a victim of one of the great political smear campaigns in the history of our country  they are coming after me to try and destroy what is considered by even them the greatest movement in the history of our country theres never been anything like this  bill oreilly and others have said its the single greatest political phenomena in his lifetime and others have said the same thing the political establishment is trying to stop us because they know we are a threat to their totally corrupt control its true  no one is more corrupt than crooked hillary clinton nobody  in fact shes the most corrupt person ever to seek the presidency of the united states of america  and her specialty if you look over the years has been character assassination and really personally just going after people thats her specialty shes been doing it her whole career the only force strong enough to smash clintons corrupt criminal syndicate is you the american voter november th november th  after many many years even many decades without complaint the media and the clinton campaign have brought forward false allegations less than a month before the most important election in modern times  these allegations are  percent false as everybody  i think you know i think you get it i think you get it theyre made up they never happened when have you met tens of thousands of people as i have and ive met thousands and thousands and thousands of people know them know them well its not hard to find a small handful of people willing to make false smears for personal fame who knows maybe for financial reasons political purposes or for the simple reason they want to stop our movement they want to stop our campaign very simple  these claims defy reason truth logic common sense theyre made without supporting witnesses no witnesses hey you know  years ago  years ago  years ago  years ago not me believe me not me not me you would be very impressed actually with my life in so many regards including that regard no not a single shred of evidence eyewitnesses have already debunked the wild and ludicrous allegations of a magazine article that appeared and ill tell you what it was just incredible it was people magazine and the article appeared and a statement was made but if it were true they would have put it in the article they would have had to put it into the article but they didnt do that and they didnt do that for a simple reason because it never happened  years ago never complained never talked to the bosses never all of a sudden two nights ago we get a call and the call is from people magazine they didnt even want a quote i think maybe what we should do boycott that issue of people magazine  so thats the way it is but i just want to tell you folks that it is a campaign thats amazing and im not going to be talking about it much because we want to talk about other things and we have to talk about other things but if it affects five percent or two percent or  percent or its all false stuff its all a concerted effort and i think its the only way theyre going to stop us the only way and i dont think thats going to happen  yes you can get him  out of here get them out get them out  hey look the great thing the cameras turned  look the cameras turned the cameras turned oh thats wonderful thats so good its the only way we get the cameras to turn so folks heres the story we are going to bring jobs back to north carolina  we are going to bring borders back to our country and yes we will build a wall  and mexico will be paying for that wall  great crowd ill tell you   this is a great crowd but i want to talk about jobs because i know this part of the world i told you i have property here a lot of great employees a lot of great people a lot of friends and your jobs are being taken pretty much like nobody elses jobs have been taken and its only going to get worse and as you stand here tonight some of your companies your leaders in your companies are negotiating with mexico and other places you know that  to move that company to mexico and during the primary system i had a very very interesting period of time because i got to know this country so well we had  people running i was given a small chance because they said hes not an experienced politician and then week after week one by one right right boom boom boom but i got to know the country and i got to see whats happening with our manufacturing we dont make much anymore by comparison to what we used to do we used to be amazing we dont do what we used to do and i had won new york state and i had gotten up to places in new york state which i hadnt seen for a long time hillary clinton represented new york state and she was a disaster she was a disaster  she said she was going to bring jobs back  jobs well it was just the opposite jobs fled she lied to the people of new york state it was a total catastrophe and if you look at whats happened to new york now you just take a look at whats happened to new york in terms of upstate and manufacturing you go to the different places albany and syracuse and rome i always say thats the real rome but unfortunately theyre having a lot of problems and youll see what happens but i went  i went oh thats an oops somebodys hurt is there a doctor in the house please doctor in the house we have to take care of our people right these are great people have to take care of our people  and we have to take care of our country because we dont want to be a divided country anymore were very divided and were going to take care of our country some of these people got here nine hours and  hours ago right right some of these people  so we can understand how there can be some problems  are you doing ok over there look ok we have tough people in this room let me tell you its hot its hot  the other night they said donald trump was sweating i was in a room that was  degrees we had  people and ill tell you what wasnt sweating too much for what we had good well make sure everythings perfect here all right well make sure everythings perfect you take your time our great police have just arrived do we love our police    everything good all right im getting the hi  sign good good give that person a hand  you know when they go down at a trump rally they leave and they always come back its an amazing thing its an amazing thing all right so well keep going you let us know if theres any problem and ill come down and help you myself all right  so we went to indiana and in going to indiana i got to know the great bobby knight that was a great endorsement coach knight you know that story he called he said mr trump this coach knight i want you to run for president i said coach i havent made up my mind this was a couple of years ago he said well if you do id like to endorse you you just let me know and we were winning state after state after state and all of a sudden we hit indiana and thats where we were going to maybe not do as well remember that they called it our watershed and i said you know bobby knight called and a friend of mine said you know have you ever had any access to bobby knight that would be great i said i just happened to and i lifted up this huge pile of papers and i wrote his number down i put it right there and it was right there it was like a miracle it was from god right it was from god  and that says jesus for trump youre right  and  and i said you know what let me do that i called bobby knight he said id love to be there i want to tell you that was a very very strong performance that he put in and we put in and then we went and run  but i really got to know our country and i got to know it well and im so proud of the people of this country and one of the things i saw and i say   you take care of that person good thank you thank you darling  shell be back you watch shell right back but one of the things that happened is i saw what was going on so closely and so vividly with respect to jobs and how our jobs are being drained because of nafta nafta is a disaster its a disaster signed by bill clinton  youre not going to believe the number    factories manufacturing plants have closed since the signing of nafta who would believe this who would believe it seventy  i thought they made a mistake i thought it would be  i said it cant be  millions of jobs wasted lost many people in this room are making less money now than they made  years ago  years ago  years ago in real wages and theyre working harder so am i so i dont feel so guilty about that this is work but not bad work this is good work because were getting to a position where if we can win north carolina  and were leading in ohio you saw that  and were doing great in florida doing great  we are doing so good in florida by the way these teleprompters havent been working for the last  minutes  and i actually like my speech better without teleprompters  and this way what i like about it wait a minute let me see how these things  you know what i like it better without the teleprompters  and i notice every time i look up theyre trying its trying its straining its straining hey get this thing out of here will you get it out  i like it much better without the teleprompter you know its very funny i went through  professional politicians top people and i went without any teleprompters then all of a sudden they said well now youre running in the election you need teleprompters and i like teleprompters theyre fine but its sort of cooler without it right   dont you think i like it better without its a little strange when you see this  i watch hillary shes got the biggest pieces of glass and sometimes theyre painted black on the other side because you see better and she always just reads off the teleprompter and its short and then she goes home and she goes to sleep  now shes not  look look shes not  shes not going to campaign anymore until after because shes prepping for the debate now the last time she prepped for a week also and lets face it you have to say i really beat her easily that was an easy    so heres the story heres the way i work heres the way government works so the teleprompters a bummer it doesnt work that means the company doing the teleprompter is in the back that means they didnt do a good job so i wont pay them right i wont pay them  and tomorrow ill have a story in the newspaper donald trump did not pay a contractor who put up the teleprompters well why should i they dont work   and  oh its true its true  and theyll make me like a bad guy like im a bad person right you know i dont pay  i pay contractors on time i am so good we just built a hotel on pennsylvania avenue the old post office on time under budget i paid  we had great contractors right but when you have a bum contractor  now heres the thing you have a bad contractor dont pay or cut the price you have a good contractor get that money out fast but the  the country should do the same thing they build roads they build roads that cost much more than theyre supposed to cost right they build roads that are crazy where theyre double and triple they build buildings where they every see a  percent theres a hospital being built in one of my favorites states its so out of control its like  percent its a va hospital a thousand percent cost overrun i looked at it i figured it was this massive  its not even a big deal its not even a big deal our country has to be able to do things on time on budget has to be able to build on time on budget has to be able to purchase its military equipment not for political reasons because some political guy owns the company but because thats the equipment that our generals our admirals and our soldiers and sailors want  have to do it  and were going to change our whole purchasing procedure for instance the purchase of drugs the drug companies have a tremendously powerful lobby we dont negotiate properly we would save so much money with proper negotiation and it is true about the military if you are somebody that has less good stuff that they dont want as much as another company but you are a political power you contribute to the senators and to the congressmen and to the people that make the decisions and you work with the admirals and you work with everybody all of a sudden theyre buying equipment thats not as good and theyre spending more money doing it were not going to be doing that stuff anymore remember this ill have spent over  million of my money running for office and some of these people said  and they say it all the time they said  one in particular said you dont realize what youve done never been done before you dont realize it doesnt matter whether or not you win or lose it makes no difference what youve done for political history i said let me tell you a little secret  if we dont win on november th it will be the greatest waste of time energy  energy you ever heard that word before energy you ever heard the word low energy he didnt sign  you know he signed that pledge but a couple of those guys that signed the pledge you know they signed the pledge because they wanted me to sign the pledge and then when they lost they never got beaten so badly in their lives folks but when they lost they didnt honor the pledge that they signed i was actually surprised only a few of them only a few of them most of them did many of them ben carson and a lot of great people a lot of great people  mike huckabees been great chris christie  weve had a lot of great support weve had a lot of great  especially from the real world a couple of our leaders arent  you know its not working out for them so well but i will tell you this we are going to have  we are going to have an amazing victory on november th were going to come back here and celebrate but were going to have an amazing victory because this is all about the people this is now about the people so let me just tell you i was talking about jobs and when you get  i feel the same way when you get  when you get to the different places within our country and you see how our companies are being sucked out into mexico and other places heres whats going to happen i go to indiana and i see carrier air conditioning  people that followed me all over indiana so many of them so much support they were fired they were there for some of them  years longer they were fired carrier announced that theyre moving to mexico theyre going to build a brand new plant and theyre going to make air conditioners  and theyre going to sell the air conditioners into our country and other places and we are fools so were just going to say oh go ahead you fire all these people in indianapolis and youre going to do this not if im president all right  ford  ford announced two weeks ago that theyre moving the production of their smaller cars  thats a big production  to mexico from our country and by the way the reason were doing well in michigan and in ohio is because they know that ive been talking about automobile production and ive been pointing out whats happening to automobile production and wheres its moving and ive been talking about it for five years crooked hillary just started talking about it and let me tell you just like she failed in new york state with jobs shes never bringing your businesses back folks shes never bringing your businesses back and shes going to give you massive tax increases massive and im cutting taxes massively so heres the story for years and years youve been hearing that companies are moving out who better than north carolina to know exactly what happened right you people have lost a lot of businesses not going to happen anymore  so whether its ford whether its carrier whether its somebody else we hear somebodys leaving were going to say we hope you stay and lets stay and lets talk nobody talks to these companies by the way do you think anybody talked from the federal government to carrier or to ford or  they just do whatever they want to do but nobody talks youve got to go see them youve got  youve got to be nice and if it doesnt work out youll tax the hell out of their product coming back here  true  so  so what happened  what happens is for years  for years and years  thats right for years and years theyve been talking about how do we keep our companies in north carolina how do we keep our countries in these different states and they give interestfree loans and they give all sorts of goodies thats  they didnt need the money they want to leave they didnt need the money so ive been talking for the last six months i said its very simple i mean i do it before even  before i said a sentence what you do is you say the following carrier are you staying or are you leaving well were leaving by the way nobodys going to leave once you tell them whats happening nobodys leaving so theyre leaving because theyre a little early and you say to them though assuming  as an example if i were made by a president secretary of keeping businesses in the united states ok  ill be  instead of secretary of state secretary of keeping businesses  not a very glamorous title but boy would i be good at that  because i would call up the head of carrier as an example and i would say congratulations on your new plant in mexico yes i agree its warm but i hear its going to be a lovely place and if you move and we dont want you to move there are consequences theyll say what are the consequences ill say every single time you make an air conditioning unit in mexico and you think after firing all of these people in indianapolis youre going to take that unit have it come across the border with no tariffs no taxes youre  percent wrong were going to charge you  were going to charge you  very importantly were going to charge you a  percent tax for any unit that you   now heres whats going to happen number one very strongly nobodys going to leave but if they do leave you know one percent two percent believe me nobodys leaving if im that secretary nobodys leaving but if they do leave were going to make a fortune so its ok either way right ladies right  because we cannot afford to continue to lose our companies were losing our companies were losing our jobs we cannot afford to lose our jobs we cannot afford to lose our manufacturing so its going to all come to an end its going to all come to an end we are going to keep our companies we are going to expand our companies we are reducing taxes the biggest tax decrease since ronald reagan and could even be bigger than that  our companies are going to stay our companies are going to expand and our companies are going to thrive in addition new companies will be started and new jobs will happen and we will produce  million jobs over a period of  years as sure as youre standing there and id give you seats but there were too many people sorry  so whether its carrier  yes   oh is that carrier air conditioning whats he talking about  oh you dont have the speaker   ill tell you whoever runs this place is not doing very well you dont have the speaker they said  do you hear me over there great job fellows so now we dont have to pay for this and now we dont have to pay for that  man  who the hell runs this place  they say the speakers dont work and i was having so much fun without these damn teleprompters right but an you hear me ok can you hear me over there   all right youre good enough see there i wouldnt deduct full but ill take  percent off the cost for the country   so well keep our jobs well thrive were going to thrive were not going to give iran  were not going to give them  million in cash that turned out to be  billion do you believe that  do you believe that  billion in cash were giving them  billion and now look at whats going on weve embolden them instead of making them our friends this incompetent president hes incompetent weve emboldened  i mean this guy all i all he does is campaign for crooked hillary  look he doesnt want trump because trump is going to be much different first of all one of my first acts is to get rid of his ridiculous healthcare that doesnt work  i wonder who pays for that big plane when he flies into campaign for hillary  i know the answer you know what happens the campaign pays for a tiny little fraction a tiny little fraction  is that good or bad oh they just got it working all right well give them  percent off  good sounds much better right good voice right all right thank you fellows thats great so we are going to  well we have no choice  repeal and replace obamacare  now you saw what happened the governor of minnesota came out he said the affordable care act is not affordable its a disaster hey folks it is a disaster hillary clinton wants to save it she wants to spend a fortune your premiums are going to go up next year over  percent this year you look at texas you look at your area you look at everywhere theyre going up     percent it is  its gone its busted its broken it doesnt work and i told you it didnt work before it was signed right because i know this stuff im pretty good at this stuff it is a disaster were going to have a new healthcare plan thats going to cost much less money both for you and for the country  and its going to be a much higher quality healthcare remember you can have your doctor you can have your plan  times right twentyeight times he said it  times  hillary clinton when she was at the state department  billion was found to be missing you saw that right this is what were going to have for our president so heres the story we are going to have a great great vibrant country again were going to have jobs were going to have jobs were going to bring back in new jobs but were going to take care of things that have never been taken care of you know what that is the inner cities we have  inner cities where the crime rate is beyond belief the levels of poverty are hard to believe were in this country the education is virtually nonexistent its so bad the  common core were going to get rid of common core believe me  common core is out were going to bring education  but you take a look at the africanamerican folks living in the inner cities where the crime is so bad you go with your child to get a loaf of bread and you get shot its so bad the crime is out of control everythings out of control you look at chicago   no  shootings   shootings since january st the crime rate is incredible murders in the united states nobody tells you this these people dont tell you this murders in the united states  murders in the united states are up  did you see the numbers the highest  the highest theyve been  the highest theyve been in  years murder so murders the highest its been in  years we are going to make our country so much stronger so much safer and for the africanamerican community living in the hell of these inner cities were going to solve the crime problem were going to help with education  were going to bring our jobs back for everybody were going to make the communities safe and you know ive been saying this what the hell do you have to lose theyre a disaster the inner cities are a disaster all over washington dc baltimore you look at the crime statistics i really say it what do you have to lose i will fix the inner cities its like a passion of mine im good at fixing things especially real estate  and importantly were going to help big league with education were going to bring in choice which is so important and so important is were going to bring jobs back to our country so the people actually have jobs so i say i hope youre going to vote for donald trump same things  same thing  same thing with the hispanicamericans is that a correct statement how many hispanicamericans do we have here one we have at least one we have a lot wow thats good  were going to bring jobs back were going to bring education back were going to bring safety back vote for trump were going to fix it that i can tell you vote for trump  vote for trump so heres a list of things were going to fix our depleted military  our depleted military  you look at where we are compared to where we used to be number of ships the kind of weaponry we have you look at whats going on with the people we just made rich look at whats going on tonight just take a look at whats going on we want to have peace through strength we have to be stronger we have to have better equipment our people in the military are the best but they have old equipment they have old fighter jets they have fighter jets that are so old that they have to go to museums where theyre on display they have to go to plane graveyards because they dont make the parts anymore these are our fighter jets that were currently using so were going to fix our very very depleted military so that our people in the military can have the kind of depth and the kind of equipment that they deserve were going to work with our veterans because our veterans in many cases are treated far worse than illegal immigrants coming in to the country were going to help our veterans big veteran state were going to help our veterans and help them big league and they know my plan its been posted and i have tremendous veteran support theres not going to be waiting online for nine days and seven days and six days and people dying people dying because they cant see a doctor quickly enough for a simple procedure or for a simple prescription so were going to fix that and you all know what were doing if you have that kind of a wait youre going outside to a private doctor across the street or youre going to a private or public hospital well pay the bill but youre not going to be dying in our country not our veterans youre not going to be dying waiting online for seven days nine days and  days  its very important we are going to stop drugs from pouring into our country  ice endorsed us just last week the border patrol agents    and ice so we have ice we have border patrol first time either one has ever endorsed an presidential candidate  we are going to stop  and i promised this to the people of new hampshire because new hampshire has a tremendous heroin problem we are going to stop drugs from pouring in to our country and poisoning our youth were going to stop it were going to stop it  and were going to stop people from coming into our country illegally but we are going to have a big beautiful door in our wall and that door is going to let lots of people in but theyre coming into our country legally  coming in legally  were going to protect your second amendment which is under siege  the national rifle association endorsed donald trump and its the earliest endorsement theyve ever given to a candidate so im proud of  these are great people these are great americans and they are doing the right thing so your second amendment under siege if hillary gets in forget it forget it we will protect your second amendment importantly  importantly  so importantly i told you about obamacare forget it its gone but so importantly we are going to appoint justices to the united states supreme court that you will be proud of  constitution  were going to be upholding and respecting our constitution so i just want to say this when you look back and we all had a good time even though your speakers were no good your teleprompters were no good as long as trump was good thats all that matters right  we had a good time but youre going to look back at this evening youre going to say hey i had a good time but youre going to go home and in  years and in  years hopefully in longer than that youre going to look back at this evening and say this was a very important evening in your life  more importantly i love those signs women for trump because i actually think im doing well with women  woah  see they may have the worst seats but theyre going to be the most famous people because look at those cameras so more importantly youre going to view your vote on november th to be the most important vote that youve ever cast because were going to take back the white house were going to   have a country that youre going to be so proud of again were going to have a country that works do you notice we dont win anymore folks when was the last time we won we have iran nipping at us you look at whats going on we cant beat isis i always say george patton i was a fan today he couldnt make it because he wasnt politically correct he was a little on the rough side right he was boom boom boom but george patton general douglas macarthur these people are spinning in their graves right now and for the military people right for the military people the element of surprise dont we like that the element of surprise so i hear who knows but we hear in mosul that a lot of the leaders of isis are in mosul right ive been hearing that for a while and they think theyre largely in mosul about three weeks ago i started hearing that we through iraq but we are going to attack mosul were going to attack them sometime within the next few months were going to hit them hard left right back forward yes sir were going to attack them theres only one problem by the time we attack them all the guys that we want are going to be gone theyre very smart how stupid are the people that run our country  why couldnt they keep it quiet why couldnt they keep it quiet knock the hell out of them grab them all and then announce a week later to the american people that weve gotten the bad ones the bad ones are gone folks theyre someplace else we  thats for the military people they understand that better than anybody am i right  do you think general george patton if he were in charge  and by the way i have over  admirals and generals supporting donald trump and endorsing donald trump  i have  recipients of the medal of honor that have endorsed donald trump so they like my attitude they like actually my knowledge people were surprised the other night when we  by the way totally totally annihilated in the debate  totally remember when she came in front of me she walked right in front of me i said huh hi hillary but remember she walked in front of me answered the question which is fine i have no problem with it and then the next day they put out something i invaded her space while on the stage i invaded did you see that right  im standing heres my lectern no no heres my lectern and im standing there and were answering and this and that and i was three to one you know i had anderson cooper and i had martha raddatz i dont think she likes me too much  i dont think she likes me too much  no but i had three to one in fact i said what is this three to one and hillary came and she walked right in front of me i was at my chair i was at my lectern i was standing there the reason is i didnt want to be scolded for that and sure as hell the next day he violated hillarys space or to put it another way he violated the space of crooked hillary so anyway but shes home now shes prepping so well see what happens but when i saw this whole thing on mosul day after day were attacking mosul in two weeks three weeks there are  not exactly all they know is that its happening what the hell are we doing what are we doing so were going to have a country run smart we wont be giving  billion to a terrorist state well be looking at the deal so close inside out and backwards and if its not if they are not living up  i mean the hardest part for me is weve given them so much money already i would have liked it much more before we gave them all that money but they dont honor that deal to every single little line every single little word were going to rip the sucker up so fast your head will spin their head will spin  its one of the most incompetent deals ive ever seen in my life im not talking about nationtonation secretary kerry never stood up and said were walking and if he did he could have made a much better deal and i dont mind making deals for nuclear i dont mind making great deals dont forget obama thinks that global warming is our biggest threat  i happen to think its nuclear warming our biggest threat is nuclear and its not global warming its nuclear warming and ill tell you what were going to work very hard on that situation because that situation is getting more and more and more out of control and hillary talks tough about russia and she talks tough about a lot of things she has no clue she talked tough about libya looked what happened there she has no clue she is unfit to be president because she has such bad judgment bernie sanders said she has bad judgment i said thank you bernie im going to be using that for about six months after they take look what happened with wikileaks they took the election away from the guy how could he be supporting her they took that election away it was a rigged system the whole system is rigged and thats why when the media does what theyre doing now thats rigging the system folks its rigging the system the election is rigged its rigged like youve never seen before theyre rigging the system these are very dishonest people  so folks i love the people of north carolina going to be back here a lot over the next  days can you believe it twentyfive  but youve got to get out and youve got to vote got to get out and vote youve got to get out and vote because we are going to make our country strong again were going to make our country rich again were going to make our country smart again were going to be a smart country again and what else are we going to do were going to make our country great again thank you very much god bless you everybody thank you thank you very much"
91,"Trump","start by thanking the fire marshal   days we are going to win  wisconsin   were going to deliver real change   were going to renegotiate  stop the massive  cut taxes and regulation  and        create millions of jobs  and repeal and replace jobkilling obamacare  new jobs will come back  like youve never seen before   trump administration  taxes will go way down    hillary    companies wont be leaving wisconsin  there will be consequences  were also going to end government corruption  hillary clinton is the most corrupt person ever to run for the presidency of the united states  newly released fbi documents   everybody understands exactly  newly released fbi documents made public just today revealed just how deep this corruption goes the undersecretary of state patrick  the fbi  unclassify emails from hillarys illegal server    in other words the state department is trying to cover up hillarys crimes of sending classified information on her server where our enemies could easily access  this is a criminal act of conspiracy that included hillarys deleting and bleaching       people  and by the way thats only a small percentage of this  but thats ok    thank you thank you thank you very much so you have the disappearance of  iphones many of them whacked with a hammer who here has gotten rid of your phone and hit it with a hammer anybody nobody oh i want to  but she whacked them a lot of them with her hammer just whacked them two boxes  i dont know if you know this  two boxes of email evidence has gone missing two weeks ago  and the destruction of laptops in a secret deal with the fbi  remember also that crooked hillary lied under oath to congress saying she had never sent or received classified information on her insecure server    and she pretended not to know that the letter c meant confidential information  hillary then told the fbi she couldnt remember  times bad memory and then in written testimony last week under oath she couldnt remember approximately  times  ill tell you  this is one of the great miscarriages of justice in the history of this country whats happened to the department of justice whats happened to the fbi is so sad you have so many incredible people in justice and the fbi and they must be absolutely reeling they probably dont believe themselves whats going on were witnessing a criminal enterprise that has turned our government into a  personal profit  your expense but it gets worse it gets worse the fbi documents which undersecretary of state dr kennedy made the request for  altering classification as part of a quid pro quo in other words a deal this is totally corruption by any standards undersecretary kennedy needs to resign     i have to tell you we havent had any of this  the bernie supporters had much more energy they really did they had a lot more energy so clinton and her cronies have sacrificed your security your familys safety and your countrys safety as though it meant nothing to her at all which it didnt this magnitude is worse in my opinion and in the opinion of many people in law enforcement this is worse than watergate whats going on with her and what did she get out of it she gets to run for the presidency of the united states  but were going to put an end to that on november th  those polls were great today but you know theyre also showing theres like an undercurrent that they cant poll remember when i was in the primaries hows he doing in such and such well it looks like he wont win that state then the next day its like he won in a landslide they said what happened  well take it any way i mean this is i guess like people dont want to say they are voting for trump which is ok well take it any way we can do you agree  but theres a big big undercurrent out there another series of emails shows top officials in the clinton campaign scheming to take massive sums of money from foreign lobbyists one of the emails from a top hillary official said quote take the money with  and you know what they had exclamation exclamation  just take the money this is money bundled by people registered as lobbyists on behalf of foreign governments  remember were competing in a rigged election this is a rigged election process and i said it with me  remember i won louisiana i said oh how many delegates do i get and they showed me that my opponents had more than i i said wait a minute whats going on here i won the state i went there on a friday night we had these massive crowds great state and i won the state so a week later im going over delegates right  and theyre saying how many i said wait a minute this guy has  and i have nine i wanted to say  no well thats the way the system works i said well then its a rigged system but you have to say we figured it out right we figured it out but it is and bernie sanders with his you know super delegates everything else bernie sanders ill bet he wished he wished he didnt endorse hillary he would have been something very special in history but were not going to let that happen to us ok not to the movement the media is trying to rig the election by giving credence  and this is so true  by giving credence to false stories that have no validity and make it the front page they take a story with absolutely nothing that didnt exist and they put it front page news because they want to poison the minds of the voters    well they really do i mean they want to poison the minds they take things and statements and put it in from  years ago from  years ago by the way just so you understand just to be very clear events that never happened just so you do understand that its so amazing its amazing i think most people do believe me thats why we are having  and its in our favor  a backlash like nobodys ever seen before theyre tired people are tired of it  front page news a phone call front page news and then it turns out its false stuff its all false stuff theres a backlash a very very prominent person from wisconsin just left the back room i said hello to him and he said mr trump i want to thank you you are taking abuse the likes of which nobody has ever run for office has taken very prominent person and i really appreciate it   and most importantly you have your former miss wisconsin right your former miss wisconsin who got out of the hospital to be with us this is one of the greatest people you will ever  who got out of the hospital stay out of that hospital will you this is an amazing person an amazing woman thank you thank you for being here  and we have our generals and we have our sheriff nobody going to mess with this guy  nobody going to mess with this guy and he was there early when he endorsed trump he was there very early when he endorsed thank you sheriff i appreciate it sheriff clark  and his family more importantly more importantly thank you for being here appreciate it the media is an extension of the clinton campaign as wikileaks has proven and they dont talk about wikileaks they just keep talking about trump trump trump they want to put nice sexy headlines up even though nothing happened nothing took place even though its a total fabrication theyve got to start talking about wikileaks theyve got to start talking about the things that are going on hillary even got the questions and answers    we need some truth we need truth we do need truth you know to make america great again we do need some truths from these people  because they poison the minds of others not everybody understands whats happening and by the time they do figure it out its too late theyre poisoning the minds of others remember this hillary even got     thats ok you notice its always one at a time one at a time    by the way where is diane hendricks  where is she where is she shes so amazing one of your great great successful people shes an amazing woman diane i know youre here someplace wherever you are an amazing woman hillary even got the questions and answers in advance of a major debate how do you do that and think of it nobody made a big deal nobody even knows about it she got the questions in advance to essentially a debate can you imagine  no no  can you imagine if donald trump got the questions in advance you know what theyd do theyd reinvent the electric chair thats what theyd do you dont even hear about that sheriff did you ever hear about this nobody has she got  and by the way behind you is one of your great football players folks look at this guy  and he is a man of god i will tell you thank you thank you one of the greats oh those championships i dont know about green bay this year what do you think are they going to be ok he says yes theyll be ok a new report from the center of public integrity shows that  percent of socalled journalists or reporters who made presidential donations this cycle gave their money gave themselves gave everything to crooked hillary clinton can you believe that  they even want to try to rig the elections at the polling booths and believe me theres a lot going on do you ever hear these people they say theres nothing going on people that have died  years ago are still voting illegal immigrants are voting i mean where are the street smarts of some of these politicians   they dont have any hes right so many cities are corrupt and voter fraud is very very common the following information comes straight from pew research quote approximately  million people one of every eight voter registrations in the united states are no longer valid or significantly inaccurate one in eight more than  million deceased individuals right now are listed as voters oh thats wonderful  well if theyre going to vote for me well think about it right but i have a feeling theyre not going to vote for me of the  million  million is voting for somebody else approximately  million people have registrations in more than one state   do we love our police do we love our police law enforcement law enforcement thank you  thank you you can see theyre getting angrier and angrier with  no because theres such a disturbance  then theres the issue of illegal immigrants voting the following comes from a  report from the washington post this article was entitled could noncitizens decide the november election here are some excerpts more than  percent of noncitizens in both  and  samples indicated that they were registered to vote oh isnt that wonderful because noncitizens tend to favor democrats to put it mildly obama won more than  percent of the votes of noncitizens in the  sample you dont read about this right they dont tell you about this your politicians dont tell you about this when they tell you how legitimate all of these elections are they dont want to tell you about this we find that this participation was large enough to plausibly account for democratic victories in various close elections ok all right noncitizen votes could have given senate democrats the pivotal th vote needed to overcome filibusters in order to pass healthcare reform and many other reforms and other obama administration priorities now it continues it is possible that noncitizen votes were responsible for obamas  victory in north carolina obama won the state by  votes so a turnout by  percent of north carolinas adult citizens  and by the way were doing great in north carolina were going to win north carolina  but we dont want noncitizen voters if thats ok is that all right to ask that it could have provided his margin of victory our system is also rigged by the donors giving hundreds of millions of dollars to hillary clintons campaign and again i will have spent over  million on my campaign i am controlling myself im working for you folks im working for you believe me  and theyre all telling me what a great job and what a big movement  theres never been anything like this in this country and they all admit it even the enemies back there admit it but if i dont win it will be the greatest waste of time energy and money that i will have  oh what a waste what a waste they all say it wont be a waste youll be in the history books let me tell you something folks i dont want to be in  i want to win if we win we will do something we will make  were going to make america great again  the reason that hillary clinton pushes the jobkilling nafta transpacific partnership  which you cannot let happen its a disaster   and for complete  oh dont worry were building the wall build the wall   who is going to pay for the wall   one hundred percent by the way im not kidding  percent all of these partnerships and for completely open borders she wants open borders she wants people to pour across our borders we wont have a country folks its because her international donors control every single move she makes if we let the clinton cartel run this government history will record that  was the year america lost its independence we will not let that happen it is time  it is time to drain the swamp in washington dc  this is why im proposing a package of ethics reforms to make our government honest once again when bill clinton  who was right about obamacare two weeks ago by the way he said its crazy  came into office he signed an executive order saying if you work for the white house or a federal agency you cant lobby the government for five years after you leave but then president clinton did what the clintons always do he rigged the system on his way out clinton lifted the executive order so clinton cronies like john podesta could start raking in cash  so heres what we as a group are announcing tonight first im going to reinstitute a fiveyear ban on all executive branch officials lobbying the government for five years after they leave government service  im going to ask congress to pass this ban into law so that it cannot be lifted by executive order right second im going to ask congress to institute its own fiveyear ban on lobbying by former members of congress and their staffs   third im going to expand the definition of lobbyist so we close all the loopholes that former government officials use by labeling themselves consultants advisers all of these different things and they get away with murder  fourth im going to issue a lifetime ban against senior executive branch officials lobbying on behalf of a foreign government  fifth im going to ask congress to pass a campaign finance reform that prevents registered foreign lobbyists from raising money in american elections and politics  this will go a long way to ending our government corruption but we will end economic stagnation also and that will help my plan for the economy can be summed up in three very beautiful words jobs jobs jobs  jobs theyre taking our jobs away theyre going to mexico theyre going all over the place were going to keep our companies here folks theyre not leaving if they want to leave there will be consequences you understand that and they wont leave when they hear those consequences believe me theyre not leaving our politicians have worked for years to try and keep our companies its so easy its so easy you want to leave you want to build you want to build  whatever you want to build  cars ford is leaving carrier is leaving so many companies theres so many you know we lost  factories   factories since the signing of nafta i thought it was a typographical error i figured maybe  maybe   factories at the center of my jobs plan will be fixing our terrible trade bills they are horrible fortyseven million americans are in poverty and  million americans are on right now food stamps we have nearly an  billion annual trade deficit in goods with the rest of the world and the worst socalled recovery by far since the great depression did you see the jobs numbers the other day horrible you saw our gdp is going to be in my opinion less than  percent you know if china goes to  percent  percent  percent its like a national catastrophe if we are at less than  percent which is what it will be its like oh what else were not going to put up with it its the clintons who gave us nafta he signed it remember that bill clinton signed the worst trade deal in the history of the world  and the clintons who gave us chinas entry into the world trade organization here in wisconsin  do we love wisconsin   you know why im here first of all i have a lot of friends here but you know why im here im here because everyones calling me everyones calling to say were going to win wisconsin  its not so traditional  no but its not so traditional for a republican to be in this position mostly they say well well have to skip wisconsin not me were going to win wisconsin  companies like briggs amp stratton have cut thousands of manufacturing jobs and moved them where to china ge healthcare recently closed its milwaukee location and shipped those jobs to mexico did you know that sheriff they just closed up thats a lot of jobs they shipped over to mexico johnson controls shuttered its plants in milwaukee and west allis and moved the jobs to mexico and moved the jobs to china and moved the jobs all over the place except for here  the list goes on and on many many companies leaving wisconsin leaving everywhere theyre leaving our country we are living through the single greatest jobs theft in the history of the world its true our companies are being raided our jobs are being let go we end up with unemployment and empty buildings they end up with cash they end up with cash tremendous factories like youve never seen magnificent plants jobs all over the place you know we end up actually with two things unemployment and drugs they end up with the cash we end up with the drugs not so good a trump administration is going to renegotiate nafta stand up to china and get along with china we dont get along with china now they rip us off and stop the jobs from leaving our country and i do a lot of business with china i have the largest bank in the world as a tenant in one of my buildings in manhattan and china is wonderful i mean i wish our people ran our country i mean like theyre like smart people theyre smart people we dont have smart people running our country we have people that are incompetent we have a president  we have a president all he wants to do is campaign for hillary clinton so that she can double your health care costs all he does is campaign  this guy every time you see him hes campaigning for clinton and frankly he ought to be working on jobs he ought to be working on the second amendment and the border and all these different things he ought to be working on taking care of our veterans right and our military  theres a guy  we go into mosul we go into mosul and why dont we just go in quietly right they used to call it a sneak attack lets call it we want to do it nice and easy ive been reading about it for four months now a primary reason for going in was we wanted to get the leaders of isis right theyre gone folks theyre smart people they read the same newspapers and articles that we read they said hey theyre going to attack mosul in four months lets get the hell out of here theyre all over the place how stupid are our people can you imagine the great general george patton and general macarthur i really had a lot of respect you know what theyre doing right theyre spinning in their graves and i see we will be attacking some time next week ive been reading about this for months and i honestly  a big big part ive always heard  and i always used to wonder why they dont go in but i meant like why are they  right surprise remember they used to call it the element of surprise now our element of surprise is in four months we will be attacking mosul i wonder what general clinton  what our generals think about that not too good not too good i can tell you what generals think  as part of our plan to create at least  million jobs in  years were going to lower our business tax from  percent to  percent  were going to make our nation rich again were going to have great companies were going to have great jobs and jobs are going to start coming back to america but to be a rich country we must also be a safe country national security begins at the border speaking in a secret meeting to a foreign government hillary clinton said her dream is for total open trade  there go the rest of your jobs  and open borders there goes your country  between open trade  your jobs  open borders  your country  so you lost your jobs and your country other than that shes doing a great job by open trade she means foreign countries can cheat us out of millions of dollars and millions of jobs  and literally not millions of dollars really its really trillions and trillions of dollars by open borders she means totally unlimited immigration in a secret speech to goldman sachs she said citizens  irredeemable hes a deplorable guy  so hillary thinks most of the country is either deplorable or irredeemable unamerican racist or basement dwellers thats what she called bernie sanderss people  basement dwellers oh bernie why did you do it bernie we know his people are saying why did you do it bernie why did you do it poor bernie now he has a rally and  people show up  he could have left a great mark on history he wont hillarys plan includes  although i think were going to get a lot of bernie people because one of the things bernie knew is that we were being ripped off on trade its a big factor    are not only going to make that but were going to have a lot of trade were going to make breakthroughs were going to have a double highway were going to have things coming back to us    so let me state this as clearly as i can      administration will secure     and defend our borders and yes we will build the wall that we just  so tell me about the wall other people many other people but they are poisoning our youth before our youth gets a chance to go and make it they are being poisoned by this garbage thats pouring in from the southern border secretary of state hillary clinton allowed thousands of criminal aliens to be released because their home countries wouldnt take them back we would bring them  we would have a murderer we would have a drug lord we would have the heads of gangs and gang members wed bring them back to their countries they intelligently said we dont want them kick them out and our guys would say oh yes ok and hillary clinton never forced these criminals back into their own countries where they came from  and i guarantee you not one time as president will you see that happen not one time there will be no times when we dont take these people and put them into their country where that country is telling us take them back we dont want that murderer that country is taking their people back theres a reason they are here you remember a long time ago i said they are forcing some of the people in let me tell you we have some people in this country that are bad dudes were getting them out were bringing them back to the country they came from and the country is going to take them  the ice officers in their endorsement of me described hillarys proposal as quote the most radical immigration proposal in united states history here is a summary of hillarys plan support totally for sanctuary cities     some bad bad people are getting security in sanctuary cities social security medicare and lifetime welfare for illegal immigrants by making them all citizens and in many cases they are being treated better than our great veterans remember that and were not going to allow it  obamacare for illegal immigrants no deportation of visa overstays expanded catch and release on the border you catch them hey go ahead do whatever you want its called catch and release expanding president obamas unconstitutional executive amnesty including instant work permits for millions of illegal workers bringing even more criminal aliens by expanding obamas non enforcement directives and she wants a  percent increase in syrian refugees to come into this country   and thats over obamas number either we win this election or we lose our country i mean that i really believe this is the last time this is it folks this is it i really believe this is the last shot we have i sort of felt it last time this time i dont just feel it i know

will go way way down under a trump administration  your companies wont be leaving colorado under a trump administration  were going to have a new government that serves the people hasnt done that in a long time  hillary clinton is the most corrupt person ever to run for president  you heard about the newly released fbi documents they reveal just how corrupt she is and it is undersecretary of state patrick kennedy illegally pressured  who really illegally pressured the fbi to unclassify emails from hillarys illegal server that server is a disaster  you know i just ripped out an article out of the paper just today where a fourstar general  one of the most highly respected people in the military  was charged with something and he has agreed to a devastating sentence and its very sad to see and i spoke to general kellogg and i spoke to general flynn who you know they are here someplace where are they come here generals come here where is general kellogg  you guys are great great guys   amazing i just spoke to the generals these are real generals too these are real guys i love having them on my plane but when im on my plane with them i sort of feel like im number three does that make sense you know theyre generals but i will tell you i just cut out the article  major article from the wall street journal  and it talked about a certain general a highly decorated man a very respected man and he just pled guilty to doing exactly what she did except like two percent of what she did general do you want to mention it    i mean honestly its unbelievable   thank you fellas great guys great guys great guys but think of general cartwright for doing three percent of what she did and life is destroyed the state department was trying to cover up hillarys crimes of sending classified information on the server our enemies could easily access now think of what we just said about a fourstar general just happened i just actually picked the article  i said is this something like what happened with her they said this is a tiny fraction of what she did it is so  it is so disgraceful she shouldnt be allowed to run for the office of president  the fbi documents show that patrick kennedy made the request for altering classification as part of a quid pro quo  nothings going to happen do you think anything is going to happen   you know we are wasting time do you think anything is going to be  might as well  in fact today the story came out and they had it like a little story because almost as corrupt as crooked hillary clinton is the media right back there  clinton and her cronies have sacrificed your security your familys safety and your countrys safety as though it meant nothing at all to her remember also that hillary lied under oath to congress saying she had never sent or received classified information on her insecure server and pretended not to know what the letter c meant confidential information that was classified right hillary then told the fbi she couldnt remember  times right thirtynine thirtynine times and then in written testimony last week under oath she couldnt remember another  times bad memory shes got a bad memory what can you do  take a look at the general cartwright story this elaborate criminal coverup included hillarys deleting and bleaching  e mails the disappearance of  phones some of which were hammered boom boom hammered who hammered their phone when they got rid of it anybody here this guy weve got to watch him check him  two boxes of email evidence is now missing as of two weeks ago missing add the destruction of laptops this is many times worse than watergate and we are going to put an end to it come november th  now they say we are tied in colorado i dont think so ill be honest i mean something is going on here something you know they say we are tied every place i go we have thousands and you cant honestly  you dont know whats on the other side of this wall you wont even believe it but they say we are tied i dont think we are tied the other one says we are two up one says we are four up one said we were six or seven down that was the one that they show on television they dont show the other ones these people but they say  lets say we are tied then how come we have thousands and thousands of people thousands and thousands sort of an amazing thing oh and these people here they are getting  to do that   you see how professional they are look at the guy now hes just walking out so yesterday there was a story that the dnc democratic national committee is sending protesters in here paying them  look at that guy hes like a pro they got him out now hes just walking  you know is disgusting it just came out yesterday and i thought so but the way they got him he walked out by the time he got to the door it was all over puts everything and now hes off look at him and you know what its all over the internet the mainstream media hardly wrote about it and they caught him yesterday not him they pay  and they give iphones to everybody if you go in and disrupt this is what were dealing with these people these are bad people and the press doesnt cover it and now look they are covering him being taken out and they will say a protester like hes this innocent little lamb  and then you wonder why our country is in trouble then you wonder why our country is in trouble take a look at whats happening now in mosul they give them four months warning they were to get isis they want to get the leaders they announced four months ago we are going in to get the leaders the leaders are smart they say hey theyre coming in to get us lets get the hell out of here theyre gone and they are meeting resistance on top of everything else boy whatever happened do you remember the expression the element of surprise you get them and then you tell the public and they will be very happy to hear it a week later these people are so just sad another series of leaked emails show top officials in the clinton campaign scheming to take massive sums of money from registered foreign lobbyists but dont hear the media talking about it we all talk about it  wikileaks proved and by the way they are not being covered they want to cover fictitious stories about me its fiction they want to cover  they just want to cover fictitious stories on me wikileaks has provided things that are unbelievable the media you have to remember is an extension of the hillary clinton campaign  and without that she would be nowhere the press has created a rigged system and poisoned the minds of the voters many of the voters of course a lot of voters their minds are just fine they know exactly whats going on  they have rigged it from the beginning by telling totally false stories most recently about phony allegations where ive been under attack constantly instead of covering wikileaks and all of those things they attack business they attacked my family they even attacked my temperament its always been my best thing  i built an incredible company  i have built an incredible company im fortunate to have a beautiful and great family  loving family and my temperament its  hey we have a winning temperament we know how to win we dont win any more right  our country our country doesnt win anymore folks look when do we win we cant win with our great military because our leaders wont let us by the way just so you know its not the military our leaders wont let us we dont win in the economy look at our jobs report from last week it was a disaster our jobs report last week was catastrophic and thats the last one before the election so maybe that should help this is an election about the truth its going to be about the truth i didnt need to do this that i can tell you a lot of people cannot handle the truth but no matter what people may think of me the one thing they know is that i am always going to tell you whats happening whats happening with our country im telling you the good and the bad but its going to start being the good  i mean you cant believe anything you see i dont even believe the polls i see these polls and theyre not terrible theyre sort of good and actually if the people come out and vote  they are very nervous i have a feeling this is another brexit this is going to be interesting they dont want to show you the good  if they take five polls of the same group they will always show the bad one but the bad ones fine its fine youve got to get out and vote ill tell you what we are going to have one of the greatest victories in political history if we get out and vote  and when hillary develops the energy to go to events  shes got very small crowd if she came up here as an example if she came here she would have lets say maybe the little group on the right hand but it wouldnt be them  i think the media is trying to discourage our people from getting out and voting i do its a very crooked group of people without the media and all the other corrupt entities that have helped her along the way honestly shed be nothing folks shed be nothing tomorrow nights going to be interesting  now shes home sleeping and im working so thats the way the way its going to be in the white house too shed be sleeping id be working  even my worst critics agree the media has come after us like they have never ever ever come after anyone before never i mean im like  theres never been a hit or a pileon and even they admit it they even say it the failing new york times  and it is failing it wont be in business in my opinion more than three or four more years they said in an article  in a major article  lets face it balance has been on vacation since mr trump onto his golden trump tower escalator to announce his candidacy so true they admit it and then they go on to say we dont care we dont care well do whatever is necessary to defeat him and to defeat those people thats what they want to do they want to stop our agenda for change but we wont let them history is watching us now waiting to see if we will rise to the moment the moment is going to be november th its very simple  and we will weve just begun to fight they even want to try and rig the election at the polling booths where so many cities are corrupt and voter fraud is all too common and then they say theres no voter fraud in our country theres no voter fraud no no theres no voter fraud take a look at st louis take a look at philadelphia take a look at chicago and then i have even the republicans saying this is a wonderful  look look if nothing else people are going to be watching on november th watch philadelphia watch st louis watch chicago watch so many other places but then do you ever notice they say there is no voter fraud now theres a voter fraud also with the media because they so poisoned the minds of the people by writing false stories they are  i have actually they are more crooked than crooked hillary i really do thats a lot  in  the washington post  thats another beauty  published an article entitled could noncitizens decide the november election guys thats the washington post the article found that  percent they are having a good time were they friend or foe   the article found that  percent of noncitizens were registered to vote and it also found noncitizen voting may have given democrats the pivotal th vote needed to pass horrible obamacare  now just think of that for a second and then you heard like  million people are dead or shouldnt be on the lists right youve got dead people voting how did that happen i dont know and i listen to all of these politicians saying the system is wonderful gotta fix the system the system is also rigged by the donors giving hundreds of millions of dollars to hillary clintons campaign the reason crooked hillary pushes for nafta or the transpacific partnership and for completely open borders is because her international donors control her every single move if we let the clinton cartel run this government history will record that  was a year america lost its independence thats true thats true it will not happen on our watch ok    its like when they look back at us at this time you know in history we will not be the ones that they talk about the replacement of the great trojan horse right you understand that were not going to be the fools that allow that to happen and i say it again when it comes to washington dc it is time to drain the damn swamp  thats why im proposing a package of ethics reforms to make our government honest once again first im going to institute a five year ban on all executive branch officials lobbying the government after they leave government service they become rich they become rich second i going to ask congress to institute its own fiveyear ban on lobbying by former members of congress and their staffs they become rich i mean these staffs become rich third im going to expand the definition of lobbyist so we close all loopholes that former government officials use by labeling themselves consultants and advisers when we all know they are just lobbyists right lobbyists fourth im going to issue a lifetime ban against senior executive branch officials lobbying on behalf of a foreign government right and fifth im going to ask congress to pass a campaignfinance reform that stops registered foreign lobbyists from raising money in american elections right  theres another major announcement im making today as part of our pledge to drain the swamp if im elected president i will push for a constitutional amendment to impose term limits on all members of congress  i am proposing a term limit of six years for members of the house and  years for members of the senate  decades of political failure and special interest collusion must and will finally come to an end its time to sweep the corruption out of washington that is why i will also ask for a ban on both white house and congressional officials fundraising during working hours they are always fundraising and ive been on the other side ive been on the other side ive given a lot of money over the years and they always come up during the day i say when you people have time to work i dont have time to work after  oclock when youre working for the taxpayer you should be doing just that  not only will we end government corruption but we will also end the crippling economic stagnation that we are in  my plans for the economy can be summed up in three very beautiful words you know what they are jobs jobs jobs  at the center of my historic jobs plan will be fixing our terrible trade deals the worst deals that anybody has ever made economically in trade fortyseven million americans are in poverty and  million americans are right now in this country on food stamps are they getting  can you believe it no can you believe it and the press doesnt want to write the story they get paid to do this    can you believe they get paid for doing this by the democratic national committee maybe i will do it a couple of times its good money ill get a nice new phone unbelievable im sure their parents are very proud of them two people so we have nearly an  billion annual trade deficit in goods with the world thats in trade we lost  billion we have a trade deficit and the worst socalled recovery since the great depression and you people know it better than anybody right here the worst since the great depression economic growth is at a total standstill and workers are earning less today than they were almost  years ago colorado has lost one in seven manufacturing jobs since bill clintons nafta a deal supported very strongly by hillary clinton who by the way has been doing this stuff for  years shes done a pretty rotten job wouldnt you think we lost  listen to this   factories since chinas entry into the world trade organization china is gaining a lot of factories probably a lot more than that another bill and hillary backed deal we are also living through the greatest jobs theft in american history probably in the history of the world they say actually probably in the history of the world its a jobs theft because our politicians are stupid they are stupid people and if they are not stupid they are under the control of the special interests and donors so whether it is stupid or corrupt it doesnt matter the result is the same a trump administration is going to renegotiate nafta stand up to foreign cheating and you know what they are doing with money supply you know what they are doing with devaluation and stop the jobs from leaving our country  as part of our plan to bring back our jobs we are going to lower our business taxes from  percent to  percent were the highest tax in the nation  we are the highest taxed in the world and we are going to be among the lower taxed in the world we are the highest taxed nation in the world we are going to be among the lower taxed not quite the lowest but were getting there were also going to fix our inner cities which have been failed and its disgraceful what democrats have done to destroy our inner cities fortyfive percent of africanamerican children under the age of six are living in poverty fiftyeight percent of african american youth are not working almost  people have been shot in the city of chicago  listen to this  since january st its like a war zone people are getting shot walking to the store the education is terrible and there are no jobs the national murder rate has experienced the largest singleyear increase in  years to those africanamericans suffering and to those latinos suffering i say what do you have to lose vote for donald trump im going to fix it  im gonna fix it i will fight harder for you than anyone has ever fought for you before we will be a rich nation again we will be able to do things that we want to do right now we owe  trillion doubled since obama came to office  and he should stop campaigning for crooked hillary and he ought to get out and work on jobs and work on the border boy oh boy hes got a lot of work fortunately he doesnt have much time left  but to be a rich country we must also be a safe country national security begins at the border speaking in secret to a foreign bank crooked hillary clinton said her dream is for open trade  there go your jobs  and open borders  there goes your country thats what it is your jobs your country  by open trade she means letting foreign countries cheat us out of millions of jobs and trillions in wealth by open borders she means totally unlimited immigration come on in folks come on in  hillarys plan includes an open border with the middle east meaning generations of radicalism and terrorism spreading and growing within our shores and in your own community  just today an iraqi refugee approved for entry by hillary clintons state department pled guilty to joining isis he entered as a refugee in november  then was approved for a green card in  its one of hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of examples of the united states voluntarily right voluntarily admitting people from the worlds most dangerous places who turn out to be terrorists and by the way we wont go over the stats and we wont go over individual cases but the crime is unbelievable vicious and violent so let me say this as clearly as i can if i am elected president i am going to keep radical islamic terrorists the hell out of our country  thats the trojan horse folks thats the trojan horse we will also stop the crisis of illegal immigration a trump administration will secure our borders and protect our jobs including jobs for millions of africanamerican and latino workers and yes we will build a wall    were going to build the wall dont worry and mexico is going to pay for the wall they just dont know it yet  we have the firstever endorsement from our ice and border patrol officers great people ice just two weeks ago as secretary of state hillary clinton allowed thousands of criminal aliens to be released because their home countries refused to take them they were too violent they were too violent so we took them back who would do this who would do this you know who would do this a weak and pathetic politician would do this the ice officer described hillarys proposal as the most radical immigration proposal in united states history here is a summary of what she wants to do support sanctuary cities  social security medicare and lifetime welfare for all illegal immigrants by making them citizens  obamacare which will die anyway for illegal immigrants no  and this is crazy no deportation of visa overstays expanding catch and release on the border expanding president obamas unconstitutional executive amnesty including instant work permits for millions of illegal workers there go your jobs  freeing even more criminal aliens by expanding obamas non enforcement directive and here is the topper of all as you know president obama has let thousands and thousands of people come in from syria she wants to have a  percent increase in syrian refugees coming into this country  either we win this election or we lose the country this is the last time weve got a shot folks its not going to happen after that the numbers arent there the numbers arent there this is the last time i hope you get up on november th or you send in those early ballots but i hope you get up on

93,"Trump","im very good thank you sean   well were going to be doing a lot of things were going to be lowering taxes were going to be strengthening our borders were going to be getting rid of regulations the regulations are going to be gone because i mean you look at this country whats happening with regulations and we need them for security and we need them for certain things like the environment but our regulations are just taking over our companies we cant compete anymore were going to be terminating repealing and replacing obama care were going to be saving our nd amendment there are a lot of things sean its going to be  i think its going to be very special   well i think they do and i think if they watched the debates they would really understand a lot i mean right now i think you have two very clear  you have a really clear choice between hillary clinton and myself and if you just look at the stances on everything  shes going to raise taxes im going to lower taxes shes going to increase regulations im going to cut regulations down to a minimum a good number but down to a minimum and theres so many different things were going to rebuild the military were going to take care of our vets were going to save the nd amendment were going to repeal and replace obama care which is a total disaster she wants to make it even a bigger mess and going to spend trillions and trillions of dollars on it and its crazy whats going on   and so you have really clear choice you have a very very distinct choice   well its totally brutal i mean you can do something thats you know just fabulous its perfect everythings great and then they end up giving you bad news and bad stories bad coverage its the single greatest pileon they say  this isnt me saying it this is other people and even news organizations  the single greatest pileon despite that you just saw the crowd we had outside were in pennsylvania now we just left north carolina im going back to pennsylvania im going to a different section in pennsylvania in a little while we have a massive crowd there its been unbelievable whats going on and i think that its not pollable although as you know three polls came out today saying im leading nationwide and look its a question of taxes its a question of borders do we want to have a country or not were going to have strong borders and were going to have people come into our country but sean theyre going to come in legally through a process theyre going to come in legally so you know i think a lot was learned in the debates i think you understand how we did and how well we did in the debates and i think we really showed a big difference      sean ive been saying for a long time its a rigged system its totally  its just terrible whats going on and then the politicians play right along with it i mean you have  million people who are dead who are registered to vote and some of them absolutely vote now you know tell me how they do that theres only one way but you have  million people or so that are registered in two states that means theyre voting twice look we have a system im a big believer in the system i love our country but i think ive done a great service by pointing this out and a lot of people agree with what im saying that i can tell you but when you look at those tapes its disgusting our rally in chicago  thats where they were they were there and nobody could figure out what was going on where did these  theyre real thugs by the way real thugs and injured policemen they injured people and they should be put in jail i mean these are bad people and again its a rigged system and who got blamed for it our rally people us me everybody   it had nothing to do with us   well i think its a disgrace and i guess he saw the president  times they say who knows but i think its disgraceful can you imagine the one who was overseeing violence  and this is a criminal act you know you  i dont know if you saw the picture cops were leaving  these policemen these great people were leaving with massive gashes in their head from these people these are professional thugs they were being paid  a day and they got cell phones out of it no this is a very serious problem and i think come november th i think were going to win and maybe were going to win bigger than people ever even dreamed when you look at pennsylvania you look at whats happening here when you look at north carolina where i just left you look at ohio and you see whats happening  you see whats happening with some of the jobs the companies that are leaving our country and going to mexico and other places you see whats happening with obama care which is such a disaster obama care is a catastrophe the premiums are going up    percent the care is no good you cant even get it the deductible  i mean say what you want bill clinton said this is the craziest thing ive ever seen he said that   and he probably suffered   but he said obama care is a disaster it is a total disaster        well take a look at whats going on i mean look at  as an example  this wasnt wikileaks but look at what you just said about the voter fraud that was uncovered with the tapes look at what you said about the thugs going into arenas and starting problems look at what came out today about the new york times where they have reporters that are soft or safe or something and i have those same reporters and they are brutal theyre not brutal theyre dishonest theyre totally dishonest its you know totally dishonest group of people and you just take a look at whats happened look at how you get set up i mean they say you saw somebody in  and you touched the person i mean give me a break this is stuff that all doesnt exist sean this is dirty disgusting stuff and theyll find out ill be revealed at some point this is dirty disgusting stuff   and you know what its no way  its no way that it should be were supposed to be a great democracy its no way that it should be i mean a certain magazine wrote some horrible things i guess it came out today nobody reports im not going to get involved in it but nobody reports it   but if somebody calls up the newspaper and says just one thing they make a big deal out of it   by the way it never happened never happened   just so you understand all that stuff it was fabricated made up never happened when you see  they come like every two days never happened   never ever happened   i think its a disgrace   its the most rigged system ive ever seen and ive been talking about it for a long time and it was rigged against bernie sanders and its rigged even more against me   its a disgrace   they poison  they poison the voters with this kind of stuff and this kind of junk that never happened   its not like a question like it may have it never  none of it ever happened   she should give it back no absolutely not youre not surprised but she should give that money back i brought it up during the debate give the money back its  million at a minimum give the money back she didnt want to answer that question if you noticed   sean you have seen things and ive had  ive seen things and ive been going through this ive never  nobody could imagine that this could happen in the united states nobody can even imagine it but ill tell you what were going to win the election and were going to clean out the swamp you know im using the expression were going to drain    the swamp of washington dc it is a swamp of absolute corruption its absolutely corrupt and were going to drain the swamp well see what happens were going to drain it but were going to win we have such enthusiasm and you saw what  i just left this rally two minutes ago in fact im sitting in a room thats about  degrees ive never seen it   its like a steam room   and no its just wonderful but ill tell you what at least youre on the side of you know exposing some of this stuff the press doesnt want to do it its incredible whats going on in our country but come november if you watch  you saw this arena it was packed with thousands of people outside something is going on thats very very special plus three polls came out today including rasmussen and including another poll that called it the most accurately four years ago and they say im    right   right   sean i want to do it tomorrow i dont want to do it right now i really want to do it tomorrow i can only say were going to make america great again we have so many problems our taxes are too high were going to reduce them our borders are weak our regulations are crazy drugs are pouring into our country people are coming into the country that we really shouldnt have come into the country we have drug lords and criminals and murderers and i mean whats going on in this country is incredible hillary wants open borders where people can just flow through were not going to have a country anymore we are going to do something very special and tomorrow i think is going to be    a special day at a special place   i did no i  look we  we say whats true and some people dont like hearing it but we say whats true    people in there   no thats ok it was a great dinner it was a great dinner no i enjoyed it i thought it was great   no i didnt she was great she understood it was  that was probably the moment of the evening people loved it   thank you thank you very much sean    if hillary clinton gets elected weve got four more years of obama we have a disaster we have isis all over        we have a bunch of babies running our country folks we have bunch of losers theyre losers theyre babies we have a president all he wants to do is campaign his wife all she wants to do is campaign if hillary clinton gets elected weve got four more years of obama we have a disaster we have isis all over   we wont win anymore and your taxes are going up and she wants to double up and triple up on obama care which has to be repealed and replaced its a disaster we are going to start making things in america again we are going to start making things in north carolina again we are bringing back our jobs america first remember that"
94,"Trump","i dont think theyre telling the truth because when i look at all of the women at our rallies i think were gonna do very well with women for trump thank you  in  days were going to win the state of north carolina and we are going to win back the white house  our opponents have spent more money than ever before in history on this campaign theyve raised it from special interests and yet we are leading in three recent polls that just came out over the last day  rasmussen los angeles times and investors business daily were leading and by the way the last one as they tell me the most accurate poll of the last cycle so thats a good sign thats a good sign because i honestly  i believe were going to win this is whats going to happen  we have two great congressmen in the group and they told me whats going on in their districts its unbelievable their areas unbelievable jimmy duncan of tennessee is here someplace wheres jimmy duncan jimmy incredible guy and he said you wont believe whats happening in tennessee and mark meadows did you ever hear of mark meadows  and much more importantly his wife the real leader in the family right thank you mark thank you for being here thank you both very much these are great people but theyre just telling me the level of excitement and the people coming out  i think were going to have  beyond the brexit  i think were going beyond brexit you know about brexit  i think were gonna have it early voting is underway so make sure you send in your ballot we cannot take a chance of blowing it we can not take a chance we have something were so close its a movement like theyve never seen in this country before never ever seen dont blow it on november th  together were going to deliver real change that puts america first were going to renegotiate our terrible trade deals end illegal immigration stop the massive inflow of refugees reduce surging crime cut taxes and regulations  so important  and hillary is going to raise your taxes big league youve seen that  were going to unleash jobproducing american energy rebuild our military and take care of our veterans who have not been taken care of  and of course one of the true staples to my campaign and i say to our campaign repeal and replace obamacare  your jobs will come back under a trump administration your incomes will go up under a trump administration your taxes will go way way down under a trump administration  your companies wont be leaving north carolina under a trump administration there will be consequences for that we will be strong and a really strong and powerful nation again our military is so depleted were gonna build it up america has grown weak and so weak that the philippines have broken with decades of proamerican foreign policy to instead leave for the orbit of china and russia you saw that yesterday the hatred  i mean why is obama campaigning he ought to be out working he ought to be out  i mean im gonna send the congressmen back to washington with that message but well send the real message on november th right well send the real message on november th  but every time i look at him hes campaigning you see the philippines the heads of the philippines  theyre so angry he leaves for china hes now negotiating with china weve been in the philippines practically forever a very important strategic ally and what happens china and russia are probably gonna take it and i see him out there campaigning for crooked hillary come on come on give me a break  strength will also require growth right now our economy isnt growing at all we had only around one percent growth last quarter gdp a disaster you know when china has one percent its over they dont have one percent they have seven percent thats considered terrible india has eight percent thats considered bad for them they dont like it we have one percent and everythings supposed to be fine but were going down if hillary gets in shes gonna raise your taxes and the one percent is going to be negative and thats going to be almost unheard of but thats gonna happen  i made a lot of predictions if that happens and if she gets in youre gonna have such negative growth you will have problems like youve never had before and our companies and our jobs will flee believe me im going to get us to  percent growth and create  million jobs over a year period  many workers are earning less today than they were  years ago theyre working harder and longer and theyre making less some of them are working two jobs and even three jobs but still taking home less pay than they were taking home  and  years ago but im working harder too folks im working harder theres no doubt about it ive got three stops today weve got three of these today weve got three  you know ive got three on occasion i have four i think i have one rest day where i have two  but these are massive rallies and were gonna do this for another  days right up until the actual vote of november th and then i dont know what kind of shape im in but ill be happy and at least i will have known win lose or draw and im almost sure if the people come out were gonna win  but i will be i will be happy with myself because i always say i dont want to think back if only i did one more rally i would have won north carolina by  votes instead of losing it by  votes right if only i did so i never ever want to look back i never want to say that about myself we have to work you have to get everybody you know out there companies like carrier are firing their workers and moving to mexico ford is moving all of its small car production announced two weeks ago to mexico thats on top of a  million plant that they already built when im president if companies want to fire their workers and leave for mexico or other parts of the world there will be a tax of  percent for any product they want to ship in to this country   and you know whats gonna happen because im a free trader a lot of people dont believe that im a free trader but our politicians have made such horrible trade deals that theyre killing our workers theyre killing our companies and our companies are being forced to move including the fact that taxes are so high there will be consequences and were not gonna lose a company in north carolina have them go to mexico or someplace else make their products sell it back in here  which we will have a very strong border  and there are no consequences and ill tell you whats gonna happen when we do this for years our government has tried to stop our companies from leaving guess whats gonna happen theyre not gonna leave anymore because all of a sudden it wont work if they do at least were gonna make a lot of money when they ship their products across the border ok  the politicians  youve never even heard of this youve heard it from me over the last six months for me it was so simple you want to move good luck enjoy the heat but let me tell you when you make your air conditioner you make your car you do this youre gonna leave all those people unemployed  there are consequences youre gonna pay a tariff or a tax  hillary clinton has raised countless millions of dollars and theyre not leaving  from big donors who want to ship our jobs to other countries including millions of dollars from corporations and countries pushing for the next nafta the next horrible trade deal its called the transpacific partnership dont let it happen that will be the rest of your jobs will be gone  the rest of your jobs thats how our system is corrupt and broken were going to take on big donors were going to take on big business and big media that have enriched themselves at your expense and i didnt need to do this folks and i was part of the other side for a long time i understand the game as well as anybody  as well as anybody but i saw the game and i saw it first hand and this country has been great to me i love this country and i said our country will not survive if we continue to play that game so this is always a tough thing to do but im doing it and i am so invigorated by the kind of reception look at this to the corners of the room  make america great again thats what were going to do its all about making america great again were going to do it and i understand it i understand it from both sides believe me and i think you know that thank you the media is so corrupt that hillary was given the exact questions to a previous debate you remember this right just recently word for word given the questions here are the questions here are the questions nobody gave me the questions now i dont know what i do would i turn the people in or would i take the questions she was given the question i think id turn them in i think id say wait a minute whats going on over here i want to know was she given the question to my debate but it doesnt matter because we won so  based on everything we won i hope that especially the last  i think the first one you know was fine i thought it was good i mean i never did this stuff before in all fairness but i think we did well i think it was good they gave me this great commission on public on presidential debates theyre wonderful except they gave me a broken mic but thats ok im screaming into the mic all night but i think the first one was fine and i think we won easily the second one and the third one was our best right third one  but she was given the questions to a debate by donna brazile who is now under pressure to resign  she should be she should resign but i ask you why didnt hillary say i cant do this i cant do this i cant take  i cant take these questions nobody from the media is asking that question why is it theyre putting a lot of pressure on donna brazile she was on television the other night it was brutal theyre putting a lot of pressure on her but tell me she handed the questions to hillary hillary read the questions figured out the answers put whatever she had to do and then why didnt she say im not allowed to do this  years ago years ago there was a show called the  question does anybody remember dont say it because its old really a contestant go ahead charles go ahead what correct how do you know it look how young this guy is a contestant got the questions in advance prior to the show and his life was ruined but hillary got the questions in advance and the press doesnt even bring it up can you imagine if i got the questions in advance and they found out  can you imagine if i got the questions and they found out they would reinvent a much more sinister form of the electric chair is that right yes yes but i have to ask the press to find out why arent they asking hillary why she didnt turn in the people that gave her the answers and those questions  but this is even bigger than what were talking about because were playing for the presidency of the united states hillary clinton is the most corrupt politician ever to seek the office of the presidency    lets do this lets do this november th lets win lets win  lets win we win we have lots of options but we got to win what a waste of time if we dont pull this off you know these guys have said it doesnt matter if you win or lose theres never been a movement like this in the history of this country i say it matters to me whether we win or lose    so ill have over  million of my own money in this campaign so if i lose if i lose i will consider this  and the nice part about saying that and i only tell you that because that means im not taking all of this money from all of these people that hillary clintons taking money   and you know her and her husband made  million i said during the second debate i said so why arent you putting  million  million  million  million  im putting in over a hundred why arent you putting in  million into your own campaign theyre not putting anything and were fighting this juggernaut because they have billions of dollars theyve raised and were fighting  i turned on the other day i was in florida and i was in pennsylvania  i turned on the television it was ad after ad after ad most of those ads were phony ads most of the things in those ads were false they were false i never said it they know i didnt say it they have different things i wont go into things because my people go crazy they say dont be particular just  i like to deny things i like to  because  but they say oh talk about jobs but these things are so false all of these things are so false are such lies but hillary  its ad after ad after ad all paid for by wall street and special interests all paid and im saying to myself i think they said in florida the number of ads gonna be  to one and were tied in florida and i think were gonna win florida  but the ads are phony ads theyre untrue mostly untrue theres a little truth in there but mostly and remember when youre watching television you see one of the thousands and thousands of ads just remember put wall street on top its wall street thats who paid for it or largely paid for it  now from wikileaks we just learned she tried to get  million from the king of morocco for an appearance more pay for play  thats why im proposing a path  of ethics reforms to make our government honest once again  its time to drain the swamp in washington dc  those reforms include the following a fiveyear ban on white house and congressional officials becoming lobbyists after they leave government service  a lifetime ban on white house officials lobbying on behalf of a foreign government thank you  a complete ban on foreign lobbyists raising money for american elections  additionally i am going to push for a constitutional amendment to impose term limits on all members of congress  not only will we end government corruption but we will end economic stagnation so important our country is doing poorly my plan for the economy can be summed up in three great beautiful powerful words  jobs jobs jobs theyve been taken away from us  at the center of my jobs plan will be fixing our terrible trade deals they are terrible they are the most incompetent deals ever made by the way nafta signed by bill clinton thank you very much president clinton  its been a oneway highway into mexico for our jobs our cash we get the drugs they get the jobs and the cash right fortyseven million americans are living in poverty and  million americans are right now in this country on food stamps we have nearly an  billion annual trade deficit in goods with the world and the worst so called recovery since the great depression

 jobs no its brought them  jobs weve lost jobs we dont win anymore by the way to get jobs we dont win on anything anymore we attack a city  mosul we attack mosul ive been reading about the attack for four months the reason they want to attack it a primary reason is to take the leaders of isis out because thats where they think they are and i say whatever happened to a surprise attack  so ive been reading about mosul and the attack and i talked about it at the debate  did everyone hear me talk about that during the debate  and i said to myself how are you going to get these people  these are tough smart people what you do is you do a sneak attack or a surprise attack right right  were too predictable we will attack mosul and three months from now we are going to get their leaders because we believe that thats where theyre staying we believe  heres obama  we believe they are in mosul so in three or four months lets see  he does  three or four months we will be attacking mosul because we want to get the leaders of isis ok well in the meantime the following day theyre out of there theyre spread all over the place in the meantime have you seen whats gone on much tougher than we thought because now theyre dug in theyre ready and its much much tougher than we thought general douglas macarthur general george patton who was too mean and too tough today he couldnt make it in the armed forces because theyd say hes not politically correct he had a very foul mouth he used bad words but his people loved him and his people would die for him but he had a foul mouth but he won he would win can you imagine him saying were going to be attacking mosul in four months to see if we can get their leaders and what theyre finding is theyre gone i told them that four months  what are you mentioning this for now if they would have said we will never ever attack mosul mosul is  no i would never do this me i would  because i always like to tell the truth but somebody could say we will never ever attack mosul and then the next day you hit them like youve never hit anybody  that would never do i wouldnt  i would not do it we have a bunch of babies running our country folks  we have a bunch of losers theyre losers theyre babies we have a president  all he wants to do is campaign his wife all she wants to do is campaign and i see how much his wife likes hillary but wasnt she

we are going to win the state of pennsylvania and we are going to win the white house  but you have to get out november th you have to get out  you just have to get out and vote otherwise weve all wasted a lot of time and energy ive wasted time energy and money so youve got to get out weve got to turn this thing around whats going on in our country today is a disgrace our opponents have spent more money than ever before in the history of campaigns raised from special interests and yet were leading in polls from rasmussen to the la times to investors business daily  leading nationwide leading  just came out just came out were leading nationwide together were going to deliver real change that puts america first  were going to renegotiate our terrible absolutely terrible horrible trade deals end illegal immigration stop the massive inflow of refugees reduce surging crime cut taxes big league cut regulations bigly end common core bring our education local   and repeal and replace obamacare disaster  your premiums are going up    percent and its only going to get worse and hillary clinton wants to do it more so  were going to repeal it were going to replace it with something much better at a fraction of the cost your jobs will come back under a trump administration your incomes will go up under a trump administration your taxes will go way down under a trump administration  your companies wont be leaving pennsylvania under a trump administration that i can tell you there will be consequences  were also going to rebuild our badly depleted military we have the greatest people on earth but theyve let it go our navy is the smallest its been since world war i my plan will be to build  ships we need a ship navy its much lower than that right now smallest since world war i can you believe that this will be the largest effort at rebuilding our military since ronald reagan and it will require a truly national effort and do we need that or what  the philadelphia navy yard is a perfect example i went to school in philadelphia i know philadelphia very well  i will instruct my secretary of the navy to study locations like philadelphia with a long history of service to our military and proximity to vibrant private industry and find ways to involve them in this national effort itll happen  as our fleet is rebuilt well need to invest in recruiting the skilled american craftsman that we need like welders and pipe fitters and so many more people that dont have jobs the greatest people well establish centers of excellence in places like philadelphia and port smith new hampshire and hampton rhodes virginia to produce the master craftsmen we need to rebuild our fleet and many other things  we will rebuild our navy and we will do it with american steel made right here in pennsylvania  and you see whats happened to our steel industry    as part of our plan for bold change to make your life better we will also rebuild our massively depleted infrastructure our roads our bridges our tunnels its all falling apart we have  trillion in debt and our roads and infrastructure are a disaster obamaclinton doubled the national debt in eight years but instead of rebuilding america the money was all lost and americas infrastructure is like that of a thirdworld country we spent  trillion in the middle east and its in far worse shape now than it was  years ago think of it we spent  trillion we could have rebuilt our country two times over imagine if we had spent this money rebuilding the inner cities of philadelphia instead we spent trillions on foreign countries and left our towns and cities to crumble how smart are our politicians these are stupid people stupid people  we defend other countries borders invest in their resources but abandoned their own think of it we fight for other countries borders and yet our body is like a sieve like water pours through  well have strong borders were going to have the wall dont worry about the wall were going to have the wall that i can tell you  we will build the wall and who is going to pay for the wall   thats right  they may not know it yet theyre paying for the wall  and i met with the president of mexico nice guy two months ago and we had a good meeting just the beginning but we had a very good meeting believe me and its very unfair we have a highway that goes right into mexico theyre taking our plants theyre taking our jobs theyre taking so much weve lost so much look at philadelphia look at pennsylvania look at whats happened to pennsylvania the jobs look at the steel industry in pennsylvania it was the greatest in the world and now its not so good its going to be good again its going to be great again not good its going to be great again  the plan im proposing targets substantial new investment here at home to fix americas transportation drinking water and other vital infrastructure this can be achieved through a focus on publicprivate partnerships proven financing programs and tax credits that incentivize companies to make major job and wealthproducing investments in your local economies it should be done  this means help for projects like the pennsylvania turnpike as well as the pennsylvania portion of the appalachian highway system it needs help needs help not in good shape amazing what it looks like now compared to  or  years ago isnt it look at your whole lives compared to  or  years ago my plan will also help pennsylvania upgrade replace bridges in the commonwealth that have been deemed structurally deficient its amazing what percentage are structurally deficient i said before sometimes you just want to swim and just relax and swim across the river get there safely  some are very very dangerous were also going to unleash  thank you i love you too  he sounds like a rough guy but i love him in my own way i love him were also going to unleash the power of american energy right here in pennsylvania shale oil natural gas and clean coal clean coal  were going to put our miners back to work folks and were putting pennsylvania back to work and were going to put the special interests  and who knows more about special interest than me but were going to put them out of work were going to renegotiate nafta stop the tpp which is a disaster and stand up to foreign product dumping and currency manipulation that make it impossible for your companies to compete  your city has lost onethird of its manufacturing jobs since bill clinton signed nafta a deal strongly supported by hillary clinton  listen to this number and ive been saying its a typo   not  or  or seven   factories have shut down or left the united states since china entered the world trade organization  that was another clinton mess and  jobs have been lost since she produced the deal the great deal with south korea  just a few miles from here theres a very famous bridge that says trenton makes the world tanks  under a trump administration i can promise you we are going to start making things in america again we are going to start making things in pennsylvania again  your products will be sent around the world not your jobs right now your jobs are dissipated were going to start making things again do you remember it used to say made in the usa or made in america where do you see that anymore you dont see it hillary is controlled by special interests who want to ship your jobs to other countries  shes the most corrupt person ever to run for the presidency of the united states  she bleached and deleted  emails after getting a congressional subpoena lied under oath to congress lied to the fbi obstructed justice made  iphones disappear some with a hammer and now we just learned that two boxes of evidence are mysteriously missing  and we just had a fourstar general highly respected general cartwright you heard what happened yesterday he could go to jail for five years because he supposedly told a lie to the fbi one lie  and i dont know that it was even a lie i dont know that our general cartwright  this is a fourstar general this happened yesterday could go to jail for five years and there have been nothing but lies to the fbi now from wikileaks weve just learned she tried to get  million from the king of morocco for an appearance one appearance more pay for play  thats why im proposing a package of ethics reforms to make our government honest once again its time to drain the swamp in washington dc    is there any place more fun to be than a trump rally right   one new proposal im outlining today will help us put the corrupt regulation industry out of business they are killing your steel they are killing your energy theyre really really hurting our country and we need regulation we need regulation for safety and we need regulation for the environment but we dont need whats happening with the regulation industry that i can tell you i will work with congress to require that for every one new regulation two old regulations must be eliminated  were losing  trillion in economic activity a year to regulations the only people getting rich are the lobbyists the lawyers and the special interests im also going to push for a constitutional amendment to impose term limits on all of our members of congress its time  not only will we in government  well do you think its time   right not only will we end government corruption but well end economic stagnation my plan lowers are business tax from  percent to  percent and lowers taxes for everybody straight across the board everybody as individuals and simplifies our tax code  were also going to rebuild our inner cities africanamericans and hispanics living in the inner cities are suffering the violence is unbelievable and unbearable you walk to the store with your child and you get shot theres no education there are no jobs theres no safety nearly  people have been shot in chicago since january st the beginning of the year homicides are up nearly  percent in washington dc and more than  percent in baltimore and its getting worse murder in the united states is up more think of it is up more than at any time over  years the highest level in  years you dont hear that from these dishonest people back there meaning the media look at them look at them the most dishonest people  they are the most dishonest people they are dishonest people   were living in a rigged system and believe me theyre a big part of the rigging those people believe me they dont tell the truth  so to the africanamerican and hispanic voters suffering in inner cities and other places that are so riddled with crime with no jobs with no education or very poor education i say what do you have to lose i will fix the inner cities i will fix education we will bring back jobs we will make the inner cities safe  some of the inner cities are as dangerous as the war zones you read about in the middle east we will do a great job we will also make our nation rich again we have to do that we have to do that  but to be a rich country we must also be a safe country national security begins at the border  speaking in secret to a foreign bank hillary clinton said her dream is for totally open trade and open borders and she denied it  and she denied it the other night in the debate but she turned out to be wrong who won the debate   that one  honestly that was not close except for a couple of dishonest groups they would say oh i think she won i think she  give me a break hillarys plan includes an open border with the middle east meaning generations of radicalism and terrorism spreading and growing within our shores not good she even wants a  percent increase in syrian refugees over obamas numbers to come pouring into our country  she wants   think of it  percent more than the thousands that are already coming in the great white horse you watch folks its a great white horse so let me state very clearly the fact that if im elected president i am going to keep radical islamic terrorism the hell out of our country  we will also stop the crisis of illegal immigration   boy what spirit pennsylvania i love pennsylvania  i

96,"Trump","wow tremendous wow thank you very much thank you unbelievable people dont know i worked in ohio did you know that  and i had a great experience  and if i didnt have a great experience starting out when i was very young maybe i wouldnt be here right now who knows you need that it was great for confidence also in  days were going to win ohio  and we are going to win back the white house  a brand new poll from remington research  highly respected  has just a few minutes ago come out and in ohio we are right now four points up  early voting is underway so make sure get out and vote we dont wanna  we dont wanna give this away   you know we have a movement going on like theyve never seen before in this country drain the swamps youve gotta a drain the swamp sign back there were going to drain the swamp believe me  but this is a movement like theyve never seen in this country before and every place is packed and the greatest people on earth and were going to turn our country around were going to turn it around fast  seventyfive percent of the people think our country is headed in the wrong direction we know its headed in the wrong direction were going to fix it were going to take our country back and its going to be put very quickly on the right track  real change begins with immediately repealing and replacing obamacare  its just been announced that americans are going to experience another massive doubledigit hike in obamacare you see that  including premiums like in the great state of arizona where theyre going to go up at  percent dont worry youll be there very soon unless i win in which case youre not going to have to worry about it  even bill clinton admitted that obamacare is quote the craziest thing in the world where people wind up paying their premiums which double and their coverage is cut in half   job killing  job killing obamacare is just one more way the system is rigged remember the name jonathan gruber the architect of obamacare  he said they could pass obamacare  when he didnt know he was being recorded  he said they could pass obamacare because the stupidity of the american voter will allow it to take place  the only stupidity was that incredible stupidity shown by our politicians when they forced this bill through over the furious objection to many politicians in all fairness many many politicians but really the american people and it was very very sad and in all fairness to the democrats had our president not lied  times  remember you can keep your plan you can keep your doctor it passed by this much  they would not have gone for it but they believed him too like everybody else believed him theyve caught them in a lot of lies lately folks hillary clinton talking about liars wants to double down  hillary clinton wants to double down on obamacare and make it even worse so here im going to repeal it replace it were going to have a replacement that is so much less expensive and so much better you dont even get to use obamacare  the deductible is so high and you know its just look it is so  it is so out of control youll never get to use it four or five thousand dollars before you can start taking just this and just happened hillary clinton declared that obamacare  do you remember this  not so long ago as one of the greatest accomplishments of president obama of the democratic party and of our county its a total disaster  here in ohio another five insurance companies are dropping out of obamacare good luck good luck in negotiations folks that means that all the residents covered by plans from these companies will be getting cancellation notices very soon obamacare is really  and you know this  a catastrophe  its a catastrophic event for ohio workers and is making it impossible for many parents to pay their bills support their families or get quality medical care to their children repealing obamacare is one of the single most important reasons we must win on november eighth  have to win real change also means getting rid of the corruption in washington dc  hillary clinton bleached and deleted  emails lied to congress under oath made  phone calls i mean   phones made them disappear sometimes with a hammer right wrong wrong lets get rid of these and then told the fbi she could remember  different times the clinton crew gave more than  to the wife of the deputy director of the fbi and the man who was overseeing the investigation into hillarys illegal server a server we now know obama knew about just found that out yesterday wikileaks the more emails wikileaks releases the more lies between the clinton foundation the secretary of states office and the clintons personal finances they all get blurred just today we read about clinton confidante doug brand  bragging that he had funneled tens of millions of dollars to bill clinton inc through the foundation donations paid speeches and consulting contracts mr band called the arrangement unorthodox the rest of us call it outright corrupt in fact the clinton foundation even hired a law firm to find out if their pay to play scheme would jeopardize their charitable status with the irs if the clintons were willing to play this fast and loose with their enterprise when they werent in the white house just imagine what theyll do given the change to once again control the oval office and weve had enough honestly i think weve had enough of the clintons in all fairness right dont you agree  had enough i mean at what point at what point do we say it hillary clinton is the most corrupt person ever to

ohio all right when we win right we are going to washington dc and we are going to drain the swamp  a lot of spirit in this room  its a good one that includes a constitutional amendment to impose term limits on all members of congress at the core of my contract is my economic plan that plan can be summarized in three very beautiful words especially for the people in this area and this room  jobs jobs jobs   no its terrible whats happened whats happened in this area whats happened in this country with jobs is terrible hillary clinton promised to bring upstate new york  jobs when she ran for senate instead the jobs left they didnt come in they left she been there for  years and hasnt fixed anything shes just made things worse except for herself and her husband fortyseven million americans are on food stamps and  million americans live in poverty nearly one in four americans in their prime earning years are not working or able to work seventy million american women and children are in poverty or on the brink of poverty and nearly half of africanamerican children under the age of six are living in abject poverty our national debt has doubled in eight years and our infrastructure throughout our country is crumbling bad shape our airports our roads our bridges our tunnels our schools our hospitals our trade deficit with the world is now nearly  billion a year we are living through the greatest jobs theft in the history of the world think of it and thats so true the single greatest jobs theft in the history of the world what our politicians have allowed to happen to this area but to all areas of our country nafta tpp they want to approve a disaster ohio has lost one in four manufacturing jobs since nafta a deal signed by bill clinton and supported strongly by hillary clinton remember every time you see a closed factory a wiped out community in ohio it was essentially caused by the clintons it was nafta it was caused by the clintons why a deal like that was allowed weve lost  factories think of that one  i tell everybody its a typo cant be  it is weve lost  factories since china entered the world trade organization another bill and hillarybacked disaster just this year eaton corporation in ohio closed its plant laid off  workers and moved their jobs to mexico and youve had many i could  i could name them all day long  under my contract if a company wants to fire their workers move to mexico or other countries and ship their products back into the united states we will put a  percent tariff on those products  and folks just in case you have any questions when that happens youre not losing your companies anymore and if you do at least the countrys gonna make a lot of money ok we will immediately begin renegotiating nafta and if we dont get the deal we want  right now its a oneway highway we lose our jobs we lose our companies we lose everything we lose our cash they get the cash they get the jobs they get the companies we get the drugs we get the unemployment thats what we get we get nothing we get less than nothing we will terminate nafta and get a much better deal for our workers if we cant renegotiate it properly were gonna get a better deal for our workers and for our companies because we cannot continue to be the people led by stupid people we cant we cant  as part of our plan to bring back american jobs we will lower taxes on our businesses from  percent down to  percent we will also cut taxes for middle class families by  percent and massively simplify taxes for all americans we will be a rich nation once again  but to be a rich country we must also be a safe country hillary clinton unleashed isis onto the world you know that story and spreading violently its spreading now into the united states there are now  open isis investigations in the united states isis is on a campaign of genocide against christians in the middle east or what they call the nation of the cross ok the nation of the cross they are crucifying drowning and beheading their victims this is something that we would read about in history books and not since medieval times right have you heard the beheadings and all the things that are happening so we have no choice we will stop isis and we still stop them fast  and unlike what theyve done in mosul which is turning out to be very difficult were not giving three and four months notice were coming in were coming in you think general george patton would say were coming in in three or four months get ready what a bunch theyre throwing people off buildings hanging their victims from meat hooks theyre hanging their victims from meat hooks the new york post just published reports about isis crushing children to death and burning adults alive now hillary wants massive immigration from the most dangerous regions of the world where isis operates including a  percent increase in syrian refugees over and above the thousands and thousands that president obama is taking  we dont want isis in our country the hillary refugee plan would leave us with generations of terrorism radicalism and extremism inside of our shores i only want to admit people who will support this country and love its people so important  keeping our families safe is the highest obligation of the president of the united states a trump administration is going to suspend immigration from terrorprone regions and we will suspend the syrian refugee program that was easy  were not going to take the risk when it comes to the safety of the american people no longer so let me state this as clearly as i can if im elected president i am going to keep radical islamic terrorists the hell out of our country    hillary also said she wants totally open borders  no one who supports open borders can ever serve as president of the united states totally open borders a trump administration will also secure and defend the borders of the united states and yes we will build a wall  have to we have to   and who is going to pay for the wall  one hundred percent mexico in terms of our trade deficits is making a fortune off the united states their leaders are doing a much smarter job but you know what well be happy with mexico mexicos gonna be wonderful were going to have a great relationship with mexico with china and with other  we dont even have good relationships now they rip us off and we still dont get along at least they should be nice to us theyre not even nice theyll be nice thousands of americans have been killed by illegal immigrants right here in ohio sixtyyear old margaret costleman was murdered in cold blood by an illegal immigrant earlier that day her killer shot another woman in the arm while she was with her children in a nearby park police encountered the man more than three weeks before the crime scene but federal authorities refused to take him into custody even though people were saying please please dont let him out please take him in then there is the case of year old earl olander a minnesota farmer who was brutally beaten by illegal immigrants and left to bleed to death in his home earls body was found with his hands bound behind his back with duct tape a blunt force injury to his head his killers had criminal records but they did not meet the obama administrations priorities for removal  but others that knew him and others that knew them were pleading were pleading dont let them out dont let them into our society i have a message for the cartels the drug dealers and the gang members when i win your long reign of crime and terror and horror will come to a very beautiful crashing end  we will also repeal obamaclinton defense cuts and rebuild our badly depleted military our air force is the smallest and oldest its ever been did you know that because i know what you have here you guys are good with wright patterson right what a great place but were very depleted we have old equipment we will build brand new modern state of the art planes to fly right at em right at wright patterson air force base we have a lot of veterans here today  i want to thank them for their service and let them know as president i have your back believe me  i have your back we will she just said make america great again mr trump we will make america great again dont worry about it we will and it wont take too long we will change our foreign policy hillary clintons policies in iraq syria libya threw the middle east into total turmoil were spending  trillion on wars in the middle east while our own country falls into total disrepair now hillary wants to start a shooting war in syria conflict with a nuclear power  russia  which could very well lead to world war iii and the way she talks about putin shes always said she has no idea but shes always saying  wikileak its russia and donald trump  i have nothing to do with russia she said maybe donald trump is involved in projects with the russians the answers no no but what she does she says donald trump and russia look look she speaks so badly of putin nuclear country she speaks so badly i say  and she uses it to keep trying to get votes i said to myself you know how do you speak so badly of somebody i mean how are they going to ever get along wouldnt it be great if we actually got along with russia and other countries  and we together went after isis and knocked the hell out of them wouldnt that be a good thing  because they want to get them out also  but she speaks very badly of putin and i dont think thats smart you know you can be very tough but you shouldnt be doing what shes doing as her own team has said in wikileaks she has terrible instincts to all americans i say its time for new leadership it really is time  it really is  can you imagine four more years of obama thats what you got to   its high taxes its high regulations all these companies they cant even breathe with the regulations unnecessary its isis all over the place you know she says shell stop isis let me tell you there was no isis there was no isis during her term she created with obama a vacuum in iraq isis formed and then obama called them the jv junior varsity right well theyre not the jv anymore folks theyre going to be no trouble we are going to knock them so hard but look look theyre not the jv and they werent them and now theyre in  different countries so shes saying we will get rid of isis she wants to go back home and go to sleep thats what she wants to do  did you see where she got upset yesterday because i took a little while just a few hours to cut a ribbon to make sure my kids did a good job we built the building by the way under budget and ahead of schedule  and she said donald trump got off the campaign trail i mean ive been doing six seven eight things a day every single day shes home sleeping half the time  i say shes definitely a low energy person i said where is hillary i watched after the last debate and after the second debate she was tired wow  she walked off that stage she had a lot of people around they had a lot of people around her which was smart everything will change in november just think about what we can accomplish in the first  days  were going to have the biggest tax cut since ronald reagan  were going to eliminate every unnecessary jobkilling regulation  were going to provide school choice and put an end to common core  were going to rebuild our military and take care of our vets  we will support the truly great men and women of law enforcement  we are going to save our second amendment which is under siege  and well appoint justices to the united states supreme court so important who will uphold and defend the constitution of the united states  americans are tired of being told by politicians they have to defer their dreams to another day but they really mean another decade its like our politics are caught in time loop we keep electing the same people over and over again clinton clinton oh clinton the impeachment the lying the whole thing were going to keep make the same mistakes if you keep doing that and we are going to continue to hear the same old excuses these career politicians keep telling us that things cant change that we cant find new solutions thats basically what they tell us well i have a message for them the future belongs to the dreamers not the cynics and not the critics the future belongs to the dreamers  im asking all americans to join me in dreaming big and bold things for our future im going to fight for every american of every background in every stretch of this nation im going to fight to liberate our citizens from violence and poverty and crime and fear and im going to fight for the inner cities and for the african american community and the way theyre forced to live in the inner cities with no jobs no education and no safety  im going to fight for every person in this country who believes government should serve the people not the donors and not

97,"Trump","thank you  thank you very much  we love new hampshire i can tell you that  i need to open with a very critical breaking news announcement   the fbi has just sent a letter to congress informing them that they have discovered new emails pertaining to the former secretary of state hillary clintons investigation    and they are reopening her case into her criminal and illegal conduct that threatens the security of the united states of america  hillary clintons corruption is on a scale we have never seen before we must not let her take her criminal scheme into the oval office i have great respect for the fact that the fbi and the department of justice are now willing to have the courage to right the horrible mistake that they made  this was a grave miscarriage of justice that the american people fully understood and it is everybodys hope that it is about to be corrected  so that is a big announcement that i heard  minutes ago and i guess obviously most of you folks have heard about and in all fairness for all of the people that have suffered for doing so much less including just recently fourstar general james cartwright general petraeus and many others perhaps finally justice will be done  with that being said the rest of my speech is going to be so boring should i even make the speech we will talk about borders right we will talk about trade well bring back our jobs well strengthen our military and lets get going ok  i want to thank general flynn hes a great general and i want to thank you for being here general thank you very much just before general flynn was going up we heard this news i said general get up there and keep them busy we want to digest what just happened here thank you general in  days we are going to win new hampshire    the state of my first victory and we are going to win back the white house  seventyfive percent of the american people think our country is on the wrong track and we are going to fix it we are going to get our country back on the right track and very very quickly real change begins with immediately repealing and replacing obamacare and that is  that is   we cant forget how big a news that is we cant lose track its a disaster just like everything else in this administration it has just been announced that americans are going to experience another massive doubledigit hike in obamacare premiums including a  percent premium hike to our very good friends in the great state of arizona  even bill clinton admitted obamacare is the craziest thing in the world where people wind up with their premiums doubled and their coverage cut in half in minnesota where the premium increase will be almost  percent the democratic governor said the affordable care act is no longer affordable jonathan gruber the architect of obamacare   admitted it was all a fraud and he said it was passed because of the stupidity of the american voter hey were doing a lot of good work arent we were catching all of these people were doing a good job jonathan gruber theres another see we didnt forget i never forgot jonathan gruber i said you know if i do this were going to run and his name came up and people forget after a week or two i said i am never going to forget jonathan gruber the architect of obamacare and what he said so we did not forget almost  can you imagine its like a little more than a week before the election we didnt forget the name jonathan gruber but the only real stupidity is that shown by our politicians who passed this monstrosity over the furious objection of certain politicians and the american voter jobkilling obamacare is just one more way the system is rigged what ive just announced previously it might not be as rigged as i thought right right  the fbi  i think theyre going to right the ship folks i think theyre going to right the ship  and theyre going to save there reputation by doing so hillary clinton wants to double down on obamacare destroying american health care forever she wants to expand obamacare and make it even more expensive i will repeal and replace obamacare and we will replace it with a much less expensive plan and a plan that is much much better  just this year hillary clinton declared obamacare is one of the greatest accomplishments of president obama the democratic party and our country well that was  thats turned out to be wrong do they do anything right we dont win anymore we dont  i mean youre going to have such a good time starting in  were going to start winning again were going to start winning again  because its turned out and ive been saying this from before it passed obamacare is a catastrophe beyond imagination insurers are leaving doctors are quitting companies are fleeing workers hours are being cut parttime jobs are all over the place those beautiful fulltime jobs that you used to have dont exist and deductibles are through the roof you dont get to use it we dont get rid of obamacare we have no choice but if we dont get rid of it our health care system is gone forever well never have another chance and by the way if we dont win this election youre never going to have another chance either that i can tell you never going to happen again repealing obamacare is one of the single most important reasons we must win on november th  but real change also means getting rid of the corruption in washington and again maybe thats happened  wow we have a big day   no think of it i won my first primary in new hampshire and i am getting here and the news this morning is  this is bigger than watergate this is bigger than watergate in my opinion this is bigger than watergate  hillary bleached and deleted  emails after receiving a congressional subpoena that alone to me  there were more serious things done but how does it get much more but that was so obvious she gets the subpoena and she bleaches and deletes  emails that to me  because it was so simple you know not  its not about the sale of the uranium that nobody knows what it means  i know what it means  to russia then she talks to me about russia  percent of the uranium in our country to russia but you know the deletion of  emails boy that just sort of is so out there after receiving a subpoena from the united states government she lied to congress she lied to the fbi she made  phones disappear some with a hammer the clinton crew gave more than  to the wife of the deputy director of the fbi   and the man who was overseeing the investigation into hillarys illegal server but maybe that takes care of itself right now that takes care of itself i think i think very proud that the fbi was willing to do this actually really very proud  just yesterday we learned that bill clintons righthand man pushed  for clintons foundation donors and other large corporations to funnel as much as  million in personal profit to bill and hillary clinton this man explained that the cozy relationship between his consulting firm to foundation and clintons personal income had helped bill and hillary enrich themselves and obtain inkind services including personal travel hospitality vacations and the like  the same people paying bill clinton for speeches were lobbying hillary clinton at the same  the same time same time  and  these people are seriously corrupt  terribly conflict hillarys pay for play included defense contracts take raytheon when the contractor wanted big foreign arms deals they hired three lobbyists that raised hundreds of thousands of dollars for hillarys last campaign and are raising money for her current campaign and by the way  to  in ads  to  and if you look at florida were winning ohio were winning iowa were winning  doing great in new hampshire i think were going to have a tremendous victory in pennsylvania  we better have a great victory in new hampshire please ok   in fact when this news  when this news of the fbis investigation when it just happened a little while ago they said mr trump i think theyd understand we could skip your speech in new hampshire this is so big i said i dont have the courage to skip the speech in new hampshire believe me i dont have the courage  im not skipping new hampshire i never will you know when i won and you remember because i go around and we had the big rallies and they said oh the big rallies will never work in new hampshire you have to sit down and have dinner with everybody i said thats like  thats a lot of dinners they dont expect that but you remember when we met and id have a lot of small meetings too with people wed  talk and new hampshire more than any other place taught me about drugs flowing into this country and your police department so great the police departments in new hampshire they told me i went to some i became friendly with some  and i never knew  i never knew honestly i knew it was bad i never knew it was so bad and i said to the people of new hampshire because more than any other place you look at the beautiful little roadways and lakes and streams and everything is so beautiful the trees and you say how could they have a drug problem here it doesnt fit but id sit down with groups and i said whats your biggest problem and i figured theyd say maybe the veterans which are suffering greatly in this area we understand that but it was always  and well solve that problem but it was always you know what it was always heroine id say heroine what do you mean and i learned so much and i said to the people of new hampshire that if i win which i did with new hampshire if i win and i also said and if i go all the way we are going to stop the inflow of drugs into new hampshire and into our country  percent  and i gave the people of new hampshire my pledge more than anybody else in this case because they really taught me about whats happening with the world of drugs pouring in hard to believe its just so so strange when you look and see the beauty of this place and then you see that heroin and drugs are your number one problem by far anyway with months these lobbyists sealed over  billion in foreign arms deals including over  billion in qatar some people would say qatar which happened to be off bill clinton  million as a birthday gift for a few minutes of face time  million the lobbyists one of whom was the sisterinlaw to hillary clintons current campaign chairman received hundreds of thousands of dollars in fees the contractor got billions of dollars in contracts and hillary clinton got her campaign cash and money for her foundation and you know im putting up tremendous amounts of money today i wrote another check for  million im spending money like crazy ill probably have over maybe close to or over  million of my money spent on the campaign but theres something nice about that unless i lose in which case i say what was that all about but were gonna do whats right for you not whats right for some contributor or special interest  hillary put the office of the secretary of state up for sale and if she ever got the chance believe me she would put the office  and you know what office im talking about  the office called the oval office up for sale too i propose a contract with the american voter which will end corruption and give government back to our great people i want the entire corrupt washington establishment to hear and heed the words im about to say and i never loved this expression but now i love it because its become  its become the hottest expression if we win on november th we are going to washington dc  when we win ok  and we are going to drain the swamp  at the core of my contract is my plan to bring back our jobs youve been suffering with the jobs the jobs have gone like candy being taken from a baby new growth numbers just released put the average growth rate for this year at a disastrous  percent if china goes down to  or  percent gdp you know its like a national catastrophe last quarter we were at  percent our job numbers last week were horrible they were anemic as the expression goes they like to say anemic that was the word they used obama is the first president in modern history not to have a single year of  percent growth and they say its hard because were a large county well india is a much larger country and theyre at  percent china is at  percent and chinas not happy so were at around  percent and we just keep going along just keep going along losing our jobs to mexico and every other place fortyseven million americans are on food stamps and  million people  think of it this is our country  are living in poverty meanwhile our trade deficit with the world is now nearly  billion a year you say who negotiates these contracts were living through obama its true you know instead of campaigning for hillary clinton he ought to be in the white house in the oval office negotiating trade deals beating isis taking care of our veterans which he does not do were living through the greatest jobs theft in the history of the world theyre stealing our jobs greatest in the history of the world  new hampshire has lost one in three manufacturing jobs since nafta a deal signed by bill clinton and supported strongly by hillary weve lost  factories since china entered the world trade organization another bill and hillary disaster the trump administration will immediately begin negotiating and we will start this negotiation so fast we will start a negotiation on nafta and if we dont get the deal we want we will terminate nafta and get a much much better trade deal  and i wont go into the details but because theyre different tax systems theyre under a vat system and were under our system but because of the fact that theyre under a much different tax system the day the deal was signed it was a defective deal with us having a massive at least  percent disadvantage so its complicated im not going to bother you or bore you with it but weve been working with a defective deal for years and nobody no politician ever went back to renegotiate it were going to get it done folks so easily  if a company wants to fire their workers and go to mexico or another country and then they think theyre going to ship their products back into the united states we will charge them a tax of  percent  so when you think these companies which right now are out there negotiating to leave here theyll leave new hampshire theyll leave pennsylvania theyre gonna leave ohio theyre gonna leave all of these places all of our great places and great states and right now as were talking theyre negotiating deals mexico is the eighth wonder of the world in terms of the new plants a friend of mine bill plante hes the biggest he said the eighth wonder of the world whats happening in mexico and i say and i tell this to people what about us he said meh not gonna be  its gonna be the other way around  but there will be consequences and you know when they realize that theyve got to now pay a tax all of that to come through our very strong border because there will be a strong border   with their product you know what theyre gonna say theyre gonna say lets say were not gonna move and theyre gonna stay its very simple but the politicians dont want to do that because theyre controlled  theyre controlled by the people that give them their campaign contributions and probably other things we will  does anybody know what i mean by that   we will also stand up to chinese currency manipulation and we will stop the transpacific partnership  we will become a rich nation again but to be a rich nation we must also be a safe nation hillary clinton unleashed isis onto the world and it has now spread into our country there are right now  open isis investigations across the united states more than at any time that weve ever had now hillary wants to increase by  percent   the massive number of syrian refugees flowing into our country thats over the obama numbers and those are thousands and thousands of people a trump administration will suspend the syrian refugee program  and well help them will safe havens and well get other countries over there like the gulf states who have nothing but money we have  trillion in debt well get them to pay they gotta do their share well lead it well help theyll pay but you know what we cant let people into this country that we dont know about  we dont know  let me state this as clearly as i can if im elected president i am going to keep  when  we love new hampshire i love this place i love this place by the way you know were leading in florida were leading in all these places the recent poll said were two down in new hampshire you know what i said i dont think so i dont think so  these polls these polls these are called dirty polls you know what that is these are false i dont think so she comes up here she has four people and its like oh we have a wonderful crowd i dont think so i think were winning new hampshire big  ok so well change it when im elected president   i am going to keep radical islamic terrorists the hell out of our country  a trump administration will also secure and defend the borders of the united states boy you people have energy youre great  well lets face it its been a long time right its been a long time youve been waiting a long time for the right person but you do have energy you know whats happening a lot of these places   a lot of the different places reports are coming out they hate to write it you know the dishonest media  but people  by the way great people oh theyre the worst theyre so dishonest they are so dishonest folks but a lot of these reports coming out in the early voting states people are coming up that have never voted these are great americans these are great people but theyve just never seen anybody that they wanted to like  theyve never heard people say were going to actually bring back your jobs were not going to let companies leave us and fire everybody and move and then let the product pour into our country with no tax no no just go ahead leave fire all our people move to mexico make the product sell your air conditioners  carriers an example theyre leaving  they might not leave theyre probably all about ready to change their mind but just let your product come right in no tax no nothing i mean how stupid is this how stupid and im a freetrader im a fair trader but we have the wrong people represent us so whats happening is these lines in florida are four blocks long they were never like that theyve never seen anything like it and in tennessee a great congressman been there for  years said to me ive never seen  we have never seen anything like it  people are coming out that havent voted in years people are coming out they literally  they hadnt voted in years so theyre not polled because you know unless you voted like in the last election they dont want to poll you so people are coming out that hadnt voted in years happening in texas they havent voted in years and people that have never even voted and yet theyre great americans they just never saw somebody that they wanted to vote for and theyre coming out and theyve got the trump shirt and theyve got the hat theyve got buttons all over the place you know  now who knows  who knows they may have all of the trump stuff and you never know maybe theyre voting for crooked hillary clinton but i dont think so right i dont think so  history has taught us that we dont think so so i think were doing great and yes on the border we have no choice we will build a wall and mexico will pay for the wall got to stop the drugs  got to stop the drugs remember my pledge to everybody but in particular to new hampshire because i know what youre going through with the drugs i know what your incredible law enforcement your police and your fire departments because i see where theyre helping so much believe me theyre  theyre not spoken about and how about where theyre shooting during fires theyre shooting at the firemen now this is a new phenomenon theyre shooting at firemen theyre shooting bullets at firemen going to fires and fighting fires so we have a divided country and were going to make our country love again were going to bring it like this room  countless americans who have died in recent years would be alive today if not for the open border policies of this administration this includes incredible americans like yearold sarah root youve heard that story youve seen it youve read about it the man who killed her arrived at the border entered federal custody and then was released into the united states community under the policies of this white house he was released again and again after crime after crime and now is at large sarah graduated from college just the day before with a  grade point average top in her class she was violently violently killed outstanding young woman i know her parents theyre incredible  also among the victims of obamaclinton open borders policy was grant ronnebeck a yearold convenience store clerk in mesa arizona he was murdered by an illegal immigrant gang member previously convicted of burglary who had also been released from federal custody and so many people said please please please dont release him hes violent and he shot grant through the head another victim who weve all read about and known about kate steinle gunned down in the sanctuary city of san francisco by an illegal immigrant  and this person was deported five previous times and now hes got a good lawyer and the case will go on and on and on hes got a lawyer i see them in court all the time the case will go on and on shot in the back while standing with her father great parents great brother then there is the case of yearold earl olander who was brutally beaten and left to bleed to death in his home the perpetrators were illegal immigrants with criminal records a mile long but who did not meet the obama administrations priorities for removal people begged that they be incarcerated or be moved out of the country but our geniuses wouldnt listen in california a yearold air force veteran marilyn pharis was sexually assaulted and beaten to death with a hammer her killer had been arrested on multiple occasions but was never deported people asked please please deport him this is what happened this is a crime wave that never ends i can tell you its thousands of cases like this when im president believe me it will end  not only will a wall keep out the dangerous cartels and criminals but will also keep out the drugs remember new hampshire and the heroin poisoning our youth our youth is being poisoned before they get a chance  and by the way ive met plenty of people in new hampshire that are not our youth that have a tremendous problem and i want to tell you were going to work with people were going to set up programs were going to try everything we can to get them unaddicted unaddicted  so as i said when i won

from  percent which is one of the highest in the world just about the highest down to one of the lowest in the world  percent  were getting rid of a lot of the regulations that are stopping growth tremendous amounts of regulation are killing your small businesses and your big businesses so were gonna have a very tax friendly country again and its gonna mean jobs its gonna mean expansion its gonna mean new companies growing we are going to create the border we are going to stop the drugs were gonna have people come into our country we want people to come into our country but they have to

during the tenure of obama and hillary clinton isis  you know she stands up and she says what shes gonna do well she was there it came out of the vacuum because we should have never gone into iraq but once we did we should have gone out the right way not the wrong way and the way they went out was so bad so bad including giving back mosul which now theyre fighting to take back and it would have been nice  the element of surprise do we agree does anybody not agree  the element of surprise we dont use the element of surprise we use the element of tell them everything we can possibly tell them

america once again but to bring back your jobs we must also must immediately repeal and replace obamacare  what a disaster  its just been announced that michigan residents are going to experience crushing doubledigit premium hikes congratulations  congratulations  in fact a number is so high i dont want to give it to you cause i want you to have a good time today ok i dont want to ruin your day ill just see you sort of slump out of here no by the way any place more fun to be than a trump rally   and honestly the subject right now isnt so positive because its whats going on with our country but were going to make it so positive  were going to make it so positive in minnesota where the premium  i mean you have to see what happens in minnesota but the increase is over  percent the democratic governor has said  and hes a big democrat  the affordable care act is no longer affordable he took a little heat for that hillary clinton wants to double down on obamacare make it even more expensive in fact much more expensive than ever before shes gonna double down in all fairness though folks  based on what were reading  in all fairness i think right now she has bigger problems than obamacare  and they finally have gotten wise to the clintons perhaps theyve finally gotten wise   wow thank you i love you too  and i have to give the fbi credit that was so bad what happened originally and it took guts for director comey to make the move that he made in light of the kind of opposition he had where theyre trying to protect her from criminal prosecution you know that it took a lot of guts i really disagreed with him i was not his fan but ill you what he did he brought back his reputation  he brought it back hes got to hang tough because theres a lot of  a lot of people want him to do the wrong thing what he did was the right thing im asking for your vote so that we can replace obamacare and save the healthcare  and look the healthcare in this country is in such dire straits we are going to save healthcare for every family in michigan for every family in our country  much less expensive much better healthcare repeal and replace we have so many alternatives so much better so much less expensive real change also means restoring honesty to our government  as you know the fbi has reopened its investigation into hillary clinton and discovered   and discovered  you heard this yesterday  its hard to believe  and discovered another  emails she lied under oath when she turned over all of her work related emails just one more lie out of so many and you know general cartwright a four star general lied one time  and i think he did it actually for national security purposes he lied one time he may go to jail for five years  shes lied so many times and the deletions this is the biggest scandal since watergate hillary wants to blame everyone else for her mounting legal troubles but she has brought all of this on herself hillary is the one who set up any legal private email server in a closet to shield her illegal activity hillary is the one who engaged in a corrupt payforplay scheme at the state department and now there are five fbi probes into the clinton foundation and their payforplay activities very very deep investigations hillary is the one who sent and received classified information on an insecure server putting the safety of the american people under threat thats what she did  sixhundredandfifty thousand  you know what i call that thats the mother load thats the  i think youre gonna find the  that are missing the  that are missing the bats  that are missing two weeks ago you know they had boxes of emails missing two weeks ago i think we hit the mother load as they say in the good old mining industry  hillary is the one who lied to congress under oath hillary is the one who lied on so many different occasions to the fbi and they know they know they know hillarys the one who made  phones disappear some with a hammer hillary is the one who destroyed  emails after she got the subpoena after before its no good but after no thats why something shouldve happened then but thats ok hillary is the one who broke the law over and over and over again we can be sure that what is in those emails is absolutely devastating and i think were gonna find out by the way for the first time  thank you huma thank you huma good job huma  thank you anthony weiner  and you all saw the statements i made him a year ago  about him a year ago you know in new york we knew  weiner and i made statements that were rough like how can she be allowed to live with this guy how can she have access to this important information and i was badly criticized right now theyre saying oh trump has good judgment wow  got good instincts i have good instincts  hillary is not the victim the american people are the victims of this corrupt system in every way and this is your one chance right now november th to change it  hillary is likely to be under investigation for a very long time one of her long time supporters a top democratic pollster good guy smart guy sharp guy doug schoen is now totally withdrawing his support hes supported their family for years  he wrote in an article  he wrote in an article quote im a democrat i worked for bill clinton but i cant vote for hillary and this is so important schoen writes im now convinced that we will be facing the very real possibility of a constitutional crisis with many dimensions and deleterious and we all know that consequences should secretary clinton win the election now i dont think thats gonna happen so hopefully   that happens we did a bad job out here folks schoen warns that if hillary is elected she would be under protracted criminal investigation and probably a criminal trial i will say so wed have a criminal trial for a sitting president in the meantime putin  who she likes to say bad things about  and all of the other leaders many of whom she says bad things about then you wonder why the world hates us but all of these people will sit back and they will laugh and they will smile the investigation will last for years the trial would probably start nothing will get done i can tell you your cars will continue to leave michigan your car production facilities like the ford facility will continue to leave michigan nothings gonna get done our country will continue to suffer shes unfit and unqualified to be the president of the united states and her election  would mire our government and our country in a constitutional crisis that we cannot afford folks we have to get back to work we have to get back to work  we need to be going to work for the american people we cant do what hillary would like to do and thats become president you cant take it i cant take it nobody can take it  and by the way we do not need four more years of obama that i can tell you right now that i can tell you   four more years of isis running wild four more years of no borders four more years of losing all of your jobs four more years of a depleted military were not building up our military for the great people in our military hillary  thats right hillary clintons corruption  eight more days  eight days youre right   is a threat to democracy and the only way to save our democracy is to get our and vote by the millions by the millions dont leave it to chance  were all hearing about our system is too honorable its to honest  both  right they say its so honest its so honest that you can name  places so can i but you hear so much about the honesty lets do this lets not worry about it get out and vote by the millions and we wont have to worry about whats taking place behind the scenes  remember this  million people that are dead are registered to vote you know they talk about oh thats a threat to democracy what im saying  million people  million people are registered to vote in two states so they vote here they go to another state they vote there theres so many things going on folks and obama the other day on television talk to you about the bedrock of our foundation and this is going to be so but the other day eight years ago when he was running for the first time he essentially was talking about how corrupt the election system is in chicago i saw it i said wait a minute hes telling us how trump shouldnt be saying these things and this guy eight years ago is on television last night talking about how corrupt it is and saying im lucky im from chicago in other words its corrupt its corrupt hes lucky hes the beneficiary of the corruptness folks get out and vote by the millions so they cant do anything we cant let them take it away  the clinton crime spree ends on november th its gonna end on november th and when we close the chapter on the clintons we open a bright new chapter focused on the american people  so we wanna now be a little uplifting because you know what we have such tremendous potential tremendous potential in our country my contract with the american voter begins with a plan to restore honesty and accountability in our government  i want the entire corrupt washington establishment to hear and to heed the words we are about to say get ready when we win on november th we are going to washington dc and we are going to drain the swamp were gonna drain the swamp  and speaking of draining the swamp donna brazile did it again wikileaks today she gave the questions to a debate to hillary clinton and that was from a couple of weeks ago happened again but this time far worse she gave the questions to a debate to hillary clinton now theyre all blaming donna brazile and frankly i think she just got fired from the network  she should be fired from the dnc by the way could you imagine if i did that bobby what would happen to be if i did that electric chair i think the electric chair if i did that can you imagine so donna brazile got fired from the network but heres the real problem uh oh    theres only one theres only one bobby knight   thank you thank you bobby thank you what a great place to be thank you bobby and you know we also have the endorsement of a great great guy jack nicklaus jack nicklaus you talk about winners jack is such a winner bobby is such a winner we have so many endorsements we have so many endorsements from such great great winners we love jack at the core of our contract is my plan to bring back your jobs michigan has lost more than one in four manufacturing jobs since bill clinton signed nafta a deal strongly supported by hillary clinton  before nafta went into effect there were  auto workers in michigan today that number is only  thousand and believe me its going down and going down fast our country has lost  listen to this   factories  bobby do you heard that seventythousand i thought it was  i thought it was    factories since china entered the world trade organization another bill  that was another bill and hillary disaster we get nothing he said what do we get we get  we get loss and unemployment we have nearly  billion in annual trade deficits with the world  billion we do all of this trade we have a trade deficit of  million we are living through the greatest jobs theft in the history of the world and the people of michigan perhaps almost more than any other place know that our trade deficit with china grew almost  percent during hillarys tenure as secretary of state its massive her trade deal with south korea you know all about that one she was pushing it so hard instead of making  it killed  american jobs so when you look around michigan and you see the rusted out factories the empty buildings and the long unemployment lines remember hillary clinton did much of this to you she wasnt there and during the debates you watch the debates  did i win the debates by the way  the debates i love those debates but you know i watch  im going to do this and im going to do that i say hillary youve been there for  years why didnt you do it shed say im going to change the tax code so that donald trump cant do that well what she doesnt say is all of her donors are doing the same thing but i said to her i dont mind if you do that then change the code why dont you do it nothing gets done the reason shell never do it is because her donors dont want it done ok and ill have over  million in my campaign which means  million of people that arent giving me money i will tell you this on the internet people   average sixtyone dollars were setting records setting records  its amazing hillary got rich selling your jobs to the same special interests who pushed the jobs out of america are the people who have given countless millions to her shes not gonna change hillary gets rich making america poor look at the devastation here delphi laid off  workers you know that and you know where they moved different places most of those jobs went to mexico by the way mexicos doing very well if shes working for mexico i think shes doing a great job were going to fight for the workers at delphi anybody here from delphi a few they dont want to raise their hand this guy had his hand sort of partially up are you  he was like uh in other words  dont worry youll be proud of it very soon they got a raw deal and they deserve better gm laid off  workers at the lake orion assembly plant in  because of imports from the south korean trade deal pushed by hillary that was her baby lear corporation laid off many people in rochester hills and moved their jobs to south korea fte automotive laid off  people in auburn hills place i know well their jobs went to mexico chrysler laid off  workers those jobs went to mexico china and india and numerous other countries ford laid off  workers their small car division is out theyre gone they moved to mexico now ford is moving a lot of different  a lot of different production facilities to a lot of different areas but when you look at whats going on in our country we want them here   a trump administration will stop the flight of american jobs if ford or another company announces they want to move their jobs to mexico or to another country then i will pick up the phone and if i have to ill do it personally even though some people would say its not presidential do i care  its not presidential sir but i have some of the greatest business leaders  carl icahn we have some of the greatest business people in the world endorsing me they will do it unbelievably well believe me but we will have  and we will use our great business people well use our great  we have the greatest negotiators in the world we dont use them we use political hacks to make trade deals our trade deal with mexico nafta is a defective deal it was defective almost from the beginning because we have different tax systems theyre on a vat system were on our system well theres a   almost a  percent difference so every deal that we make we are behind  percent before we even start people have known that for years and years and years and its a defective agreement nobodys ever changed it believe me its going to get changed very quickly ok  i will call the executives and i will tell them that if they want to do that where theyre taking their factories and theyre taking their everything and theyre moving it and they think theyre gonna sell their cars or their air conditioning units back into the country we will charge them a  percent tax when they try to ship their products back across what will end up being an extremely strong border  and you know what just the fact that were going to do that or we would do that theyll never move theyre gonna stay in michigan nobody ever told them that if somebody went to them said look please stay please stay you know well go this that then they say no were leaving were going to mexico then you say all right theres the story no more mr nice guy you make your cars you make your air  you know carrier air conditioning indianapolis great place fourteenhundred people laid off violently i mean  people worked there  years they laid them off so all i say is this you want to build your plant in mexico have a great time but if you think youre gonna ship your product across the border  which will be a very strong border by the way  you think youre gonna ship your stuff across the border for no tax no nothing so we end up with unemployment and end up  we end up with empty plants and factories and you end up with the money the jobs and the plants you can forget it and you know what would happen if you said that right up front nobodys leaving folks you stop it right away the politicians dont want to say that because most of them are too stupid to even understand it  but the ones that arent are taken care of by the special interests and their donors because they want those companies to move because its to their benefit it used to be that cars were made in flint and you couldnt drink the water in mexico now the cars are made in the mexico and you cant drink the water in flint not good  but were gonna turn it all around and were going to rebuild flint i was to flint recently and ill tell you what its gone down a long way and were going to help you rebuild detroit  and mr gilbert  has done a great job by the way friend of mine done a great job and were going to rebuild michigan and were going to keep your jobs and lots of other things so id like to share a special message with the africanamerican community of michigan which has been so terribly harmed by the policies of the clintons and a lot of the democratic politicians look at the city of detroit take a look it used to be the manufacturing hub of the world now nearly half of detroit residents dont work it has the secondhighest violent crime rate in the united states and the children are trapped in failing horrible government schools yet as the people of detroit suffer hillary wants to spend trillions of dollars on government benefits for illegal immigrants and refugees pouring into our country  ive outlined a plan for urban renewal which i believe so strongly in its called a new deal for black america  that deal includes a plan to use the money we will save by securing our border and curbing refugee admissions to invest in communities like flint and detroit were gonna bring in big numbers of jobs tremendous incentives  it includes a pledge of school choice for africanamerican children  my plan also includes a promise to cancel billions and billions of dollars in climate change spending for the united nations  its insane a number that hillary wants to actually increase and instead use that money to provide for american infrastructure including clean air and clean water  you saw this recently were gonna to spend billions and billions and billions of dollars for a plan that we dont even know where the moneys going and in the meantime our companies wont be able to compete because theyre being regulated and restricted theyre not gonna be able to compete and im an environmentalist i will tell you ive received many environmental awards but i want clean air i want crystal clean water and i want safety and we dont have to give hundreds of billions of dollars away to people that are probably laughing at us and not going to do  you know where the moneys going not gonna happen my plan also includes a pledge to reduce violent crime every child in this nation has a right to grow up in safety and in peace  and my plan includes a pledge to restore manufacturing in the united states were going to start making things again hillary and the democratic party have run the inner cities for years and only produced more poverty more crime worse education the time has come for real change i am asking you for the honor of your vote so together we can turn decades of political failure into generations of lasting access for your children and your grandchildren  hillary on the other hand wants to destroy whats left of manufacturing in michigan with the transpacific partnership by the way a disaster its a disaster  a trump administration will stop the transpacific partnership and by the way were going to have tremendous trade deals but were not gonna have a deal thats  pages long that ties in all of these countries together you have to see a bar chart lines all over the place if somebody does something wrong you cant do were gonna have single lines going to single  single different countries and if they dont do good by us we send them whats called a letter of termination  days and during that  days theyll call and well probably make a new deal and itll be even better simple deals folks you have to see this crazy transpacific partnership and they dont take care of monetary manipulation which is the single biggest weapon that foreign countries use to kill us especially china theyre grand masters we will renegotiate nafta and if we dont get the deal we want we will terminate nafta and get a much better deal well make a much better deal  we are going to lower taxes on american business from  percent to  percent  we are going to massively cut taxes for the middle class  we will unleash american energy including shale oil natural gas and clean coal were going to put our miners back to work  the obamaclinton war on coal is going to cost this state  jobs at least and you have a war on your steelworkers too folks your steelworkers are suffering we will also work to restore and protect the great lakes we are going to become  we are going to become a rich nation again but to be a rich nation we must also be a safe nation hillary clinton wants a  percent increase in syrian refugees pouring into this country  hillarys immigration plans mean generation of terrorism extremism and radicalism spreading into our schools our communities and every other place right here in michigan and all throughout the united states when we win we will suspend the syrian refugee program  and we will keep radical islamic terrorists the hell out of our country we have no choice  and well build safe havens for them in syria were going to get the money from the gulf states they have plenty of money they dont do their share well get the money from the gulf states well lead the effort because we all have heart we see whats happening but we cant do this we dont want to be the great trojan horse of the future its not gonna happen to us folks you see whats happening in germany you see whats happening in paris people dont even go to paris anymore my friend used to go to paris oh donald i love paris its just so beautiful for years  i said to him the other day hows paris he said we dont go there are you crazy no were not going to be the stupid people anymore folks were gonna be the smart people  a trump administration will also secure and defend the borders of the united states and yes we will build a wall and you know that we received  so important you have to have it i dont know if you know hillary wanted a wall did you know that and you know why they didnt it a big fence wall you know why they didnt build it they couldnt get their environmental impact statements can you believe it the united states of america wants to put up a wall in   hillary was in favor of it they couldnt get the approval to build the wall can you believe this and then you see china in the middle of the south china sea building a massive fortress and you know what happened they said sunday evening lets do it you know when work started monday morning i jokingly said to a friend of mine in china how long did it take you to get the environmental impact statement approved he looked at me and said youre kidding arent you i said yes im kidding so theyre building theyre ripping it up with the biggest excavators youve ever seen and theyre ripping it up and theyre building  theyre not supposed to be doing it by the way the only reason theyre doing it is because they have no respect for our president whos out campaigning all the time this guy ought to spend more time in bringing jobs back to michigan and less time  and less time fighting for somebody whos under criminal investigation which he shouldnt be doing  weve received the firstever endorsement from our ice and border patrol officers  border patrol officers the first time theyve ever done it because they know we know what were doing they tell us the border crisis is the worst its ever been its a national emergency they also warn that americas plan under hillary clinton is the most radical proposal  quote radical proposal in us history when i become president we will end illegal immigration deport all criminal aliens we have people in this country that are serious serious criminals and we will put america first you know we have some very very rough people and we want to deport the people while she was secretary of state and they bring these people back to their countries and the countries very intelligently they said no we dont want a murder no we dont want a drug dealer we dont want the head of a gang in los angeles they call up the secretary of states office they said oh thats ok bring them back so we release them right into our country how stupid are we and i promise you  its wellknown  i promise you whether its four years or eight years well figure that out there wont be one time  there wont be one time when any of these thugs come back into our country not one time  we will also repeal the obamaclinton defense sequester and rebuild our badly depleted military we need a new foreign policy that puts america first and were going to have it very very quickly hillary led us to disaster in iraq in syria in libya then after benghazi she looked the families of the fallen in the eye and lied she blamed their deaths on a video which was a lie  remember when she back to bosnia under fire remember oh it was under fire it was so dangerous seriously under fire remember but they had a video clip she landed and these beautiful little girls were handing flowers and they  she came under fire it turned out not to be true she apologized she apologized but you have to ask her the media  the most dishonest people they have to ask her  they have to ask her   they have to ask her they have to ask her when donna brazile who i told you just got fired when donna brazile gave her the questions to the debate  asked this question to her why didnt she report it she accepted those questions she accepted those questions to the debate she had the questions to the debate forget about donna  i dont care about donna brazile why didnt hillary clinton report that she was given essentially unethically probably illegally why didnt she report that she had the questions hillary and our failed washington establishment have spent  trillion on wars in the middle east and now its worse than its ever been before had obama and others gone to the beach obama could have gone to the golf course we would have been in much better shape we shouldnt have gone into the war and she thinks im a hawk oh donald trump we shouldnt have gone in and we certainly shouldnt have gotten out the way we got out because she created a vacuum isis formed now shes im going to get rid of  shes going to rid of isis she has zero chance she is dreaming isis is dreaming about her becoming president and she also  you know shes going to fix it there was no isis when she was secretary of state she and obama created it through the vacuum that they created by stupidly the way they got out even mosul  were trying to retake mosul for a second time because we essentially gave it up so now were going in and we gave them  did we give them enough advanced notice four months is enough time right general did we give mosul enough advanced notice i think so four months and i keep saying whatever happened to the element of surprise the element of surprise and were trying to retake mosul a second time we essentially gave it up did we give them enough advanced notice four months is enough time general did we give mosul enough advanced notice i think so four months and i keep saying whatever happened to the element of surprise the element of surprise imagine if some of the money had been spent  trillion in the middle east on building new schools and roads and bridges right here in michigan now hillary trapped in her washington bubble thats blind to the lessons wants to start a shooting war in syria in conflict with a nucleararmed russia that could drag us into a world war iii ok folks she  i will tell you what she will get us into world war iii she will get us into world war iii i will tell you that shes incompetent she will get us into world war iii the arrogant political class never learns they keep repeating the same mistakes over and over again they keep telling the same lies they keep producing the same failed results how can hillary manage this country when she cant even manage her emails  its just one disaster after another one scandal after another one betrayal after another to all americans i say it is now time for new leadership all of them  and just in finishing up in finishing up just think about what we can accomplish in the first  days of a trump administration we are going to have the biggest tax cut since ronald reagan hillary is increasing your taxes we will eliminate every unnecessary job killing regulation were going to cancel every illegal obama executive order  we will rebuild our military and we are going to take great care of our fantastic veterans its about time  twentytwo veterans a day commits suicide can you believe that number twentytwo veterans a day are committing suicide they wait on line for seven eight

99,"Trump","thank you very much great people great state thank you everybody so we have thousands of people outside but rather than wait lets get started right  we have almost  people theyre going to be coming in as we speak but i think we get going right now is that correct they are being checked out i want to begin by thanking the great wisconsin leaders who are here with us today chairman reince priebus who gave a very inspirational speech senator ron johnson i hope you all going to get out and vote for ron were going to  were going to repeal and replace obamacare  a great athlete people dont know that great athlete and a wonderful guy hes been with me right from the beginning congressman sean duffy   and your party chairman whos done an incredible job we all know brad courtney thank you brad thank you  thank you everybody a special thank you to governor scott walker   who has done a fantastic job in wisconsin i want to tell you i ran against him he is tough he is brutal i want to be very respectful he is one tough cookie so to governor walker i want to thank you tremendous tremendous competitor   and were with him forever thank you scott thank you most importantly i want to thank all of you here in attendance today and everyone who is part of this magnificent movement to make america great again that is what were going to do  in just one week we are going to win the great state of wisconsin  and we are going to win back the white house its going to happen folks a lot of good polls out there today we just got one were seven up in north carolina  seven up north carolina were way ahead in florida way ahead in ohio wow were doing great ohio and florida were doing great iowa way up in iowa were getting tremendous help from governor branstad were sort of way up everywhere you know they were saying texas is going to be close it looks like texas is in play guess what total blowout we love texas  we love texas were way up in georgia that was another one that said it looks like georgia might be in play guess what were way up so thats the way it is  i also want to thank some of our great people that were here tonight mayor giuliani who is incredible and hes been so loyal  and how about coach bobby knight he did pretty well against you folks but we still respect we want winners right were on the cusp of something incredible  historic change that transfers power from a failed political establishment and returns that power to our families communities and citizens its going to happen real change that begins with immediately repealing and replacing obamacare a total disaster total disaster  its just been announced that the residents of wisconsin  congratulations  are going to experience a massive doubledigit premium hike you know that right  im not going to tell you what it is because i want you to leave here happy i dont want you to be depressed but dont worry about it were going to get rid of it so youre not going to have to worry about it  in the great state of arizona premiums are going up more than  percent theyre not too happy  more than threequarters of the counties in wisconsin are losing obamacare insurers next year lots of luck in your negotiation with whoever is left in minnesota where premiums are going to be increased  whos from minnesota  wow wow  great great thats so nice look at that man and you look fantastic he says minnesota cancer patient for trump youre going to get better ok youre going to get better youre going to get better fast you look beautiful thats cool and you know we just had news that in minnesota we are doing fantastically well i didnt know well have so many people  thats great were going to do our job for it the premium increase will be close to  percent  you know that   percent in minnesota and a lot higher following so thats pretty bad the democratic governor has just said the affordable care act in minnesota is no longer affordable premiums are surging companies are leaving insurers are fleeing doctors are leaving and deductibles are through the roof other than that its a wonderful thing many americans are now paying more for health care than for their mortgages or their rent  a first in the history of america first time thats ever happened obamacare is a disaster its a  its a total catastrophe yet hillary clinton wants to double down on obamacare making it even more expensive and its still wont work  im asking for your vote so we can replace obamacare and save health care for every family in wisconsin and for every family in our country  real change   thank you everybody thats so nice you know this is a movement like has never been seen in this country before  and if i said that and if it werent so those extremely dishonest people the media the worlds most   dishonest people horrible people untruthful people they would be saying he said this he said that he said this let me tell you they are extremely dishonest and yet we are leading with all of the dishonesty were leading and i think were leading big and i think on november th it will even be bigger  real change also means restoring honesty to our government as you know the fbi has reopened its investigation into hillary clinton  this is the biggest scandal since watergate and now its been reported that there are fbi inquiries probing virtually all of hillary clintons inner circle  she wants to blame everyone else   you know somehow i think that obamacare is not going to be her biggest problem does that make sense  she wants to blame everyone else for her mounting legal troubles but she has really no one else to blame but herself hillary is the one who setup an illegal private email server to shield her criminal activity you know that she knows it hillary is the one who engaged in a corrupt paytoplay scheme at the state department hillary is the one endangered national security by sending classified information on an insecure server  hillary is the one who lied so many times to congress and to the fbi   times to the fbi and each lie  i mean each time she said  remember she does  right she said sorry i dont recall i dont recall  times well each time she said that that was also a lie and im not even including that hillary is the one who made  phones disappear some with a hammer it was hillary who destroyed  emails after receiving a subpoena from the united states congress   after and she is also the one  this just came up recently by the way if that were reince or me or somebody it would have been the biggest story in the world she also accepted debate questions given to her in advance and then used them to cheat against bernie sanders   instead of reporting this terrible  say terrible breach right instead of reporting this terrible breach of ethics to the public or to somebody she used it you notice they keep talking about donna brazile donna brazile well donna brazile cheated and frankly she should resign from the dnc  she was just fired from the networks she should now resign from dnc think of that can you imagine if reince got the questions for a debate gave them to me and they found out you know what it would be a double electric chair right it would be on the front page in the new york times the washington post its hardly covered can you believe it she got  i mean to me its such a breach you know being a student being a believer in so many different things  to me its such a breach she got the questions and didnt report nobody even talks about that they talk about donna brazile but they dont talk about hillary hillary got the questions in a debate against bernie sanders and she didnt report it  surreal cheating and it was hardly covered but we know the answer so get out and vote on november th remember  hillary is not the victim the american people are the victims of this rigged and corrupt system in every way and this is your one chance to change it  its your one chance i dont think youre going to have another chance folks we have an election coming up youre not going to have another chance in four years you can forget it if she were to be elected it would create an unprecedented constitutional crisis and the work of government would grind to an unbelievably unglorious halt she is likely to be under investigation for many years probably concluding in a very largescale criminal trial  in a newly released email john podesta has been caught saying we have to dump all of those emails can you believe this thats wikileaks  and he also said to me it has made a big  a big statement john podesta  ill tell you what if he worked for me i would fire him so fast he is such a nasty guy  he would  i would fire him like the apprentice john youre fired  amazing nasty guy hes a nasty guy   hes a nasty guy but he said you know you dont like to say bad things you work for people he said hillary has bad instincts bernie sanders said she has bad judgment shes got both theyre pretty similar when you think about it as it also turns out one of the top department of justice officials the assistant attorney general is a close associate of podesta the two met for dinner after clinton testified about benghazi and podesta described him as the man who kept him out of jail works for the justice department has our country ever had a situation like it is going on right now have we ever had anything like it  this is a good time to make an important public service announcement because a lot of things have happened over the last few days this is a message for any democratic voter who have already cast their ballots for hillary clinton and who are having a bad case of buyers remorse  in other words you want to change your vote wisconsin is one of several states where you can change your early ballot if you think youve made a mistake a lot of stuff has come out since you voted so if you live here or in michigan or pennsylvania or minnesota those four places   you can change your vote to donald trump well make america great again ok  she is not going to make america great she will never make america great the clintons are the sordid past we are the bright future i say we  we its we i am a messenger  i am only a messenger remember im only a messenger but you have to say im doing a pretty good job as a messenger  but im the messenger my contract with the american voter begins with a plan to restore honesty and accountability to our government finally  i want the entire corrupt washington establishment to hear and heed the words we are all here to say when we win on november th we are going to washington dc and we are going to drain the swamp    youre not told  ive said this before but it was very interesting because when i first heard the statement i said give me a break i hate it  i said  i said it the people went crazy then i went to a rally with  people i said it they went totally crazy and then i said it again and again this has only been going on for about a week and a half and now i love it i love the statement and it is very active it is very active  at the core of my contract is my plan to bring back our jobs  right now  million american women and children live in poverty or near the brink of poverty forty  thats so true can you believe in this country fortythree percent of africanamerican schoolaged children live in poverty thirtytwo percent of hispanic schoolaged children live in poverty this is our country this is unacceptable in america i will fix it  i will fix it  i will fix it  ive been saying a lot and ive been saying and speaking very openly about the inner cities and saying to the africanamerican community the hispanic community ive been saying what do you have to lose its such a disaster what do you have to lose  thank you were going to fix it were going to bring back great schools were going to stop the crime the crime is unbelievable we are going to bring back your jobs what do you have to lose we are going to fix it as your president i will go into the poorest communities and work on a national plan for revitalization  we will replace decades of failure with generations of success were going to have generations of success america has lost one third of its manufacturing jobs since bill and hillarys nafta you know about that  onethird of your jobs  you know we have a highway oneway highway right into mexico in these other countries they get the jobs they get the plants they get the money we get the unemployment and the drugs not a good deal thats going to be changed around folks its going to be changed here  i mean you listen to this where america has lost  were going to build a wall dont worry about it were going to build a wall  thats not even close and mexico is going to pay for the wall and they understand that they understand that  america has lost  listen to this because its impossible i have been saying for two weeks  i just got this stat  for two weeks ive been saying thats a typo thats some kind of an error it cant be possible america has lost  factories   i thought they meant  i said you have a mistake here maybe  america has lost  factories because of politicians that dont know what they are doing or they are controlled by their special interests since china entered the world trade organization  another bill and hillarybacked disaster  we are living through the greatest jobs theft in the history of the world thats whats happening to our country were being treated like were stupid people we have leaders who do not know what they are doing we have leaders that dont have a clue its the single greatest jobs theft in the history of the world thats whats happened to us hutchison technology laid off  workers right here and moved their jobs to thailand honeywell laid off  workers making printed circuit boards in chippewa falls their jobs  you wont be clapping for this  their jobs went to china this is a federal problem because scott and these people have kept so many places but theyre  its very hard its very hard because we dont fight with real tools meaning you make your product you want to come back not going to be so easy youre going to pay a nice big fat tax on that product coming in  ttm technology laid off  workers and most of them went into mexico and other places lots of jobs going to china lots of jobs going to japan lots of jobs going to south korea and unbelievable numbers of jobs and plants and factories and everything else going into mexico a trump administration will stop the jobs from leaving america and we will stop the jobs from leaving wisconsin well work with your governor who is a great great governor and were going to stop it  we are going to stop it the theft  and thats what it is  of american prosperity will come to a very rapid end from now on its going to be america first    a donald trump administration will renegotiate nafta and we will stand up to foreign product dumping all over currency manipulation and all of the unfair subsidy behavior thats going all over our country makes it impossible  impossible for our businesses to compete theyll be competing very soon  we will also immediately stop the job killing transpacific partnership that will be a disaster  as part of our plan to bring back jobs we are going to lower taxes on american businesses from  percent down to  percent were the highest taxed nation in the world  we will become a rich nation again but to be a reach nation we must also be a safe nation in chicago  people have been shot since january st of this year can you believe that thats worse than the places you read about and see in the middle east these are war zones we have places that are more dangerous in milwaukee homicides have risen to the highest level in more than  years nationwide murders have experienced their largest single year increase in  years you dont hear that from the dishonest media they dont tell you that  they dont tell you that  they dont tell you that theyre there for one reason they want to protect certain people like hillary its getting hard to protect her fellows its getting very  getting very very hard to protect her  getting very hard to protect her shes out of control a trump administration will work with local and federal law enforcements to end this growing crime wave we have a crime wave every child in america has the right to grow up in safety and in peace  and we will also keep you safe from terrorism hillary clinton wants a  percent increase in syrian refugees flowing into our country  who cant even believe it her plan would mean generations of terrorism and extremism spreading into your schools and throughout your communities when i am elected president we will suspend the syrian refugee program we have no choice  and we will keep radical islamic terrorists the hell out of our country  a trump administration will also secure and defend the borders of the united states and as i said and as you know were not playing games yes we will build the wall    and the fact that its  degrees in this room i dont care  think of it as a sauna this room was not designed for this many people think of it as a sauna and to use a sauna you have to pay money we get this for nothing we have received the first ever endorsement from our ice and border patrol officers first time they have ever done it  great amazing people they tell us the border crisis is the worst its ever been its a national emergency its the worst its ever been right now you know you try and get some stats they dont want to give you the stats  the worst its ever been right now just about as bad as it gets hillary has pledged totally open borders there goes your country   which truly would mean the destruction of the united states in a true sense the immigrant officers warned in a letter when they endorsed me that hillarys plan is quote the most radical immigration proposal in united states history and that it would quote lead to the loss of thousands and thousands of lives as secretary of state hillary clinton allowed thousands of the most dangerous and violent criminal aliens to go free because their home countries very intelligently would not take them back they dont want to take back murderers drug lords gang members they say no and let me just tell you something they would bring them to their country their country would say no get them out bring them back to the united states where your leaders are stupid people bring them back to the united states let me tell you that wont happen whether its four years or eight years that wont happen once if i am president not once  one such criminal was set free on hillarys watch went on to kill a young american girl a fantastic young woman named casey chadwick you probably read about her the killer who had already been convicted for shooting a girl in the head previously and who people were begging to incarcerate or send out of our country should have been sent home instead he was set free and stabbed casey in the face and neck  different times and stuffed her body in a closet people were begging that he be sent out  were going to make america safe again believe me  thats one of many thats one of many so many different stories hillary also strongly supports sanctuary cities   like in san francisco where the incredible kate steinle incredible young woman was killed in her fathers arms by a fivetime deported illegal immigrant a trump administration will cancel all federal funding to sanctuary cities  we will deport all criminal aliens stop the drugs from pouring into our communities and we will end this long nightmare of violence like weve never seen before  we will also appeal the obamaclinton defense sequester and re build our badly depleted military we have no choice  we have no choice that includes great support for nearby fort mccoy  i am honored to have the endorsement of more than  top admirals and generals and  medal of honor recipients  its a great group nobody has like we have whether its law enforcement the military the veterans and we are going to take care of our veterans folks  our new foreign policy will put america first hillary brought disaster to iraq  just total disaster to iraq syria libya she empowered iran and she unleashed isis with the great void that was created by the way her and president obama  the campaigner  i call him the campaigning  he ought to focus  instead on campaigning for hillary clinton where hes probably now got a conflict in campaigning for her  he ought to focus on bringing jobs back to our country focus on getting rid of isis focus on lots of other things  now hillary wants to start a shooting war in syria a conflict with a nuclear armed russia that could frankly for all we know to trigger world war iii for what hillary and her failed washington establishment have spent six trillion dollars on wars in the middle east that never end and that we never win remember that they never end and we never win and now the middle east is in worse shape than ever before we could have built our country twice we could have rebuilt the united states with six trillion dollars we could have rebuilt it twice they dragged us into foreign wars that have made us less safe they have left our borders wide open at home and they have shipped our jobs and wealth to other countries  to all americans i say it is now time finally for new leadership for change  thank you in closing just think about what we can accomplish in the first  days we are going to have the biggest tax cut since ronald reagan  and she is going to raise your taxes substantially remember we are going to eliminate every unnecessary job killing regulation  we will cancel every illegal obama executive order there are plenty of them  there are plenty of them  there are plenty of them we will rebuild our military and we will take care of our great great veterans were going to take care of them they have been treated terribly  terribly our veterans have been treated terribly   thank you we are going to provide school choice and put an end to common core were bringing our education local  we will support the great men and women of law enforcement that will take place quickly  the national rifle  you know this right the national rifle association nra endorsed me  the earliest endorsement theyve ever given to anybody running for president  we are going to save our second amendment which is totally under siege were going to save our second amendment  and appoint justices to the united states supreme court who will uphold and defend the constitution of the united states  hillary wants us to think small wants us to believe things cant change and wants our lives to revolve around washington dc  i am asking you to dream big to push for bold change and to believe in a movement powered by the people and by their love of this great country  i am tired of politicians telling americans to defer their dreams to another day when they really mean another decade america is tired of waiting the moment is now  there has never been a movement like this in our countrys history there never will be again perhaps but we have to take advantage of it on november th were going to turn things around and rapidly and rapidly all we have to do is stop believing in our failed politicians and start believing in each other and in our country  there is no challenge too great and no dream outside of our reach there is not there is no dream outside of our reach dont let anyone tell you it cant be done the future lies with the dreamers not the cynics and not the critics  hillary clinton has been there for  years and she has accomplished nothing shes just made things worse  she is the candidate of yesterday we are the movement of the future we are we are  our movement represents all americans from all backgrounds and all walks of life we are asking for the votes of republicans democrats independents and firsttime voters of which there are many there are many  we are asking for the vote of every american who believes truth and justice not money and power should rule the day for our country  and i have been on the other side and i understand the other side perhaps i understand it better than anybody else but i love our country and i saw what was happening to our country and i made the right decision because boy did i become an outsider quickly that i can tell you  we are fighting for every citizen who believes that government should serve the people not the donors and not the special interest  we are fighting to unlock the tremendous potential of every american community and every american family who hope and pray and yearn for a much better future and it will happen with your vote we are just  listen to this after all of this time one week  one week do you believe it  this started on june th   june th thank you   thank you thank you everybody i

100,"Trump","thank you very much thank you  i would like to thank my incredible running mate governor mike pence thank you  and i love you too  we have a lot of very enthused and excited people in this campaign so i really do thank all of you  i would like to thank my incredible running mate mike pence on the tremendous job hes done and hes a fantastic leader and a leader on health care issues and to have him involved is just my very great honor believe me  id also like to thank dr ben carson  not only a great man and i dont say that about a lot of people but one of the toughest competitors ive ever faced people dont know how well he did during those primaries and i just kept looking back and i just kept seeing him and boy ill tell you but even more importantly hes a brilliant physician and i hope he will be very much involved with my administration in the coming years  thank you id also like to recognize the distinguished members of congress in attendance who have all been at the forefront of health care and have been so helpful to me congresswoman ellmers lummis congressmen price harris burgess and desjarlais  and let me give a special thanks to senator barrasso a terrific doctor a senate leader who did incredible work chairing our platform committee just unbelievable work so i want to thank you very much senator fantastic job  and been very very loyal to what were doing and what we represent so thank you senator  when we win on november th   and elect a republican congress we will be able to immediately repeal and replace obamacare have to do it  i will ask congress to convene a special session so we can repeal and replace and it will be such an honor for me for you and for everybody in this country because obamacare has to be replaced and we will do it and we will do it very very quickly it is a catastrophe the president said if you like your plan you can keep your plan if you like your doctor you can keep your doctor   which may go down as one of the great political lies of the century even the skeptical democrats believed him and approved the legislation there were democrats that were very much against it but they believed him and they approved it no one ever read or certainly very few people the  page bill to this day nobody understands it the obama administration has just announced massive double digit and triple digit obamacare premium hikes everywhere all throughout the country here in pennsylvania premiums are going to increase more than  percent and thats nothing compared to what will happen in the future of course in the future im president there wont be obamacare so you wont have to worry about it  that means parents wont have enough money to pay their bills or get medicine for their kids in the great state of arizona a wonderful place i just left premiums will go up even higher than  percent other states are going up more than     percent deductibles can go to    even  in other words your health care wont even be usable youre paying all this money you wont even get to use it people all across the country are devastated in many instances their health care costs are more than their mortgage costs or their rent which by the way is a first in american history this is particularly unfair to millennials and younger americans generally who will be totally crushed by these massive health care costs before they even get started on their journey through life onethird of the counties  think of this onethird of the counties in pennsylvania will have only a single insurance company left if you have that that includes philadelphia where i went to school the associated press found that some of the  pennsylvania consumers who buy insurance through healthcaregov will face some of the highest premium increases in the nation the people of philadelphia  insurers are leaving premiums are soaring doctors are quitting companies are fleeing and deductibles go through the roof workers hours are being cut hiring is frozen  totally frozen  and wages are being slashed obamacare means higher prices fewer choices and lower quality yet hillary clinton wants to expand obamacare and make it even more expensive she wants to put the government totally in charge of health care in america if we dont repeal and replace obamacare we will destroy american health care forever its one of the single most important reasons why we must win on november th we must win  thank you  thank you   thank you very much everybody thank you our replacement plan includes health savings accounts a nationwide insurance market where you can purchase across state lines and letting states manage medicaid dollars so much better we will create quality reliable affordable health care in a free market where parents can make the health care decisions that they really wanna make for their families it will be a much better health care at a much less expensive cost weve also outlined detailed solutions on so many other issues to make life better for every american family and while this is really  thank you  while this is really a meeting and thats what it is its a meeting of very very special people and i appreciate you all being here but its a meeting talking about health care and obamacare our plan for other things also include the bringing back of manufacturing jobs we have to do it  were gonna bring back your manufacturing were gonna bring back our jobs that formed the backbone of the american middle class and our country as a whole our jobs are being stolen pennsylvania has lost almost  percent of its manufacturing jobs since nafta a deal signed by bill clinton and supported by hillary clinton the city of philadelphia has lost more than onethird of its manufacturing jobs since china joined the word trade organization another bill and hillarybacked disaster a trump administration will renegotiate nafta believe me and we have the greatest negotiators in the world we will use our great negotiators  well  have a fair deal but well have a deal that goes in two directions not one direction right into mexico and these other places  and stand up to foreign product dumping currency manipulation and unfair subsidy behavior  we are going to bring manufacturing jobs lots of jobs back to pennsylvania were gonna do it and it wont even be difficult  were going to open modern mines and take care of our great miners our miners have been mistreated horribly  we will be producing clean coal oil natural gas and shale energy  were also bringing back our steel workers who have been so badly hurt so badly hurt  whose jobs have been stolen by the dumping of steel all over the state and frankly all over this country by china and other countries nobody has been treated worse than these workers but that will change on january th of next year believe me it will change  were also going to provide the children of the state with school choice so important  that means parents can spend and take care of their children but they can send their kids to public school to private to chartered to magnet to religious or to home school its going to be their right and its going to be something thats so so good for your children and for the education of your children  we will also totally eliminate common core and bring education local were gonna bring it local  people do not like common core in this country that i can tell you   and our system is failing so its obviously not working were gonna eliminate common core were gonna bring it local our tax plan will provide a  percent tax cut to middle class families with two kids as an example you have two kids a  percent cut so desperately needed our middle class has not been properly respected that i can tell you  we will let parents deduct childcare expenses from their taxes and create taxfree childcare and elder care savings accounts with matching contributions for low income families  we will eliminate the obamaclinton defense sequester and rebuild our badly depleted military when did we ever need it more greatest people on earth in our military but its badly depleted    thank you people love this country dont they isnt it beautiful right beautiful  its a beautiful thing to watch and see and i see it all over the country no matter where we go and every time i say we are going to rebuild our depleted military its always the same response its an incredible response  our navy is the smallest its been since world war i think of that smallest since world war i and rebuilding it will require a national effort thats why i will ask my secretary of the navy to review facilities like the philadelphia navy yard i know it well  with a long history of service to our navy proximity to vibrant private industry and room for expansion to enlist them in the rebuilding of what will be a great fleet again  to recruit master craftsman  this buildup requires and we will establish centers of excellence at locations like the philadelphia navy yard vocational training is a great thing we dont do it anymore we dont do it anymore  and i must tell you so often in going to college right down the road and going to college we have people that were brilliant and we had other people that werent as brilliant in that way but were brilliant incredible when it came to fixing a motor when it came to fixing something that i had no idea what was happening and other great geniuses had no idea what was happening and they could take it apart blindfolded  and we dont do that anymore vocational training for our country is so so so important  and just in closing  and they loved it they loved it they didnt want to be doing what i was doing they loved it they were so good at it and they loved it so vocational training were going to start it up big league  we will rebuild our military and we will rebuild our country im not a politician my only special interest is you the american people thats why ive done this   thank you very much  the guiding rule of the political class in washington dc is that they are looking out only for themselves only for themselves with the exception of these few people  i feel guilty as im looking theyre staring me in the eyes so i have to say with these exceptions they will say anything and do anything and cling to their power and prestige at your expense im running to change and reverse decades of failure and to work with the american people to create generations of success im running  im running to restore honesty to our government and safety to our communities we need safety and by the way our law enforcement officials these are great great people  thank you and we are going to give great prosperity to our economy i want to go into our poorest communities and work on a national plan of revitalization the inner cities  and ive been working with so many africanamerican groups these are such incredible people weve been talking about it working on it were going to bring jobs into the inner cities were going to bring safety were going to bring education good good schools into the inner cities  the spirit of the people in the inner cities is beyond the spirit of anybody and its gonna work its gonna work you watch americans are tired of being told to defer their dreams to another day but politicians for the most part really mean another decade because thats what theyre talking about enough waiting time is now but to accomplish our goals we must cut our ties with the small  bitter petty politics of the past we must declare our independence from a failed establishment that has squandered  trillion on foreign wars in the middle east that never end that we never win and that have made us far less safe think of it   think of all the money thats spent all the lives that have been lost  and were far less safe today than we were before we started theyve left our borders wide open at home and shipped our jobs and wealth to other countries its time for new leadership    ive led a great life and i truly love our country so now i want to give back to the country thats been so good to me thats why im doing this  all i see everywhere i travel in this nation and ive been everywhere is untapped potential waiting to be realized the people are amazing the people are amazing if we unlock the potential of this country and its incredible people no dream is outside of our reach  if we stopped believing in our failed politicians and start believing in ourselves then anything anything is possible  im asking you to dream big to push for bold change and to believe in a movement powered by our love for each other and our love for our country  that is how we will truly make america great again  thank you very much thank you everybody god bless you thank you"
101,"Trump","thank you thank you  i love that sign blacks for trump i love that sign thank you  there are a lot of those signs thank you women for trump  hispanics for trump  theres one women and hispanics for trump  thank you very much in six days we are going to win the great state of florida and we are going to win back the white house  percent  were on the cusp of an incredible historic change that transfers power from a failed political establishment and returns that power to our families communities and citizens to you the system is rigged remember that the system is rigged right now its rigged were going to change it theres some breaking news about that subject that were going to discuss right now as i mentioned yesterday on of the  and you probably saw this and maybe some of you have just read it  one of the top department of justice officials involved in the email investigation assistant attorney general peter kassig   is a close associate of john podesta the two met for dinner after clinton testified about benghazi and podesta who by the way said hillary clinton has terrible instincts on wikileaks described him as the man who kept him podesta out of jail kadzik is also the one who helped lead the effort to confirm attorney general loretta lynch now today in a newly released e mail  through wikileaks again  we learned that kadzik was feeding information about the investigation into the clinton campaign and that   right and that kadzik said quote it will be a while before the state department posts the emails remember they were waiting for the emails  podesta forwarded the emails to clintons top staff and said additional chances for mischief these are the people that want to run our country folks  the spread of political agendas into the justice department  theres never been a thing like this that has happened in our countrys history  is one of the saddest things that has happened to our country but with your vote you can beat the system the rigged system and deliver justice so show up early and vote show up early you know the lines are incredible the polls are all saying were going to win florida dont believe it dont believe it get out there and vote pretend were slightly behind you got to get  we dont want to blow this this is the one chance we have itll never happen again its not going to happen in four years its not going to happen  it cant happen again this is a movement like we have never seen in this country before these crowds the enthusiasm the love  got to get out and vote real change begins with immediately repealing and replacing obamacare  and hillary is not going to be the answer because she wants to make it more expensive shes doubling down its just been announced that the residents of florida  sorry to tell you this folks  are going to experience a massive massive double digit premium hike  now i know what that hike is but i want you to leave here happy i want you to be happy people i want you to think about the future after we take back the white house so im not going to tell you what your hike is but let me just say its going to be very substantial and obamacare doesnt work on top of everything else as an example in the great state of arizona  which i just left  premiums are going up more than  percent its out of control over  percent of the counties in florida are losing obamacare insurance next year lots of luck in your negotiation in minnesota where the premium increase will be close to  percent the democratic governor said the affordable care act is no longer affordable premiums are surging companies are leaving insurers are fleeing doctors are quitting and deductibles are absolutely through the roof wasnt supposed to be like this but i said it was going to be like this before it was passed because i understand how business works  obamacare never had a chance its a catastrophe yet hillary clinton wants to double down on obamacare making it even more expensive its going to go up a lot people arent going to be able to afford it so im not sure that it matters theyre just not going to be able to pay im asking for your vote so we can replace obamacare and save health care for every family in florida and the united states  real change also means restoring honesty to our government as you know the fbi has  did you hear about this little event the fbi reopening the investigation  theyre reopening the investigation into crooked hillary clinton  crooked hillary shes crooked    she is a crooked one theres no question crooked hillary clinton you know that term has really stuck everyones calling her  has anyone seen crooked hillary clinton today  thats going to be a great term for a president right boy oh boy what a mess this is the biggest scandal since watergate and now its been reported that there are fbi inquiries probing virtually all of hillary clintons inner circle and many of the things shes done over the years its about time remember its a rigged system remember its about time she wants to blame everyone else for her mounting legal troubles but she really has no one to blame but herself hillary is the one who set up the illegal private email server to shield her criminal activity the woman screaming exactly exactly it is exactly hillary is the one who engaged in a corrupt payforplay scheme at the state department and who ripped off the people of haiti the people of haiti were ripped off  and i met with the people of little haiti anybody here these are great people great thank you hillary is the one who endangered national security by sending classified information on an insecure server hillary is the one who lied so many times to congress and the fbi hillary is the one who made  phones disappear some with a hammer  and shes the one who destroyed  emails after receiving a congressional subpoena  she also accepted debate questions given to her in advance by donna brazile   and then used those debate questions to cheat its cheating the worst level instead of reporting this breach to an ethics committee or whoever would listen to the breach so she got the answers cheating she got the questions cheating and then she  rather than reporting them rather than saying this shouldnt be happening  she used them against bernie sanders can you imagine  she probably got them against me too except we won the debate so easy i dont think it mattered we won those debates  did you see her at the end of the debates folks she was exhausted you know what she did she immediately went home and went to sleep  hillary is not the victim and the american people frankly are the victims of this rigged and corrupt system in every way but this is your chance finally to change it november th now in floridas case earlier now just so you understand record turnout unbelievable numbers unbelievable were doing great with the africanamerican community  were doing great with the hispanic community  and the lines are four five and six blocks long theyve never seen anything like it and the polls have just come up were way up in florida i shouldnt say that because i want you to go vote  ok ready were going to pretend were down were down pretend right well pretend were down no we got to win we got to win big we got to beat her got to beat her were up in ohio were up in iowa were up in north carolina  i think were doing great in pennsylvania from what i hear  folks youre going to be so proud youre going to be so proud were going to make america great again youre going to be so happy and youre going to be so proud of your country again if hillary clinton were to be elected it would create an unprecedented and protracted constitutional crisis  havent we just been through a lot with the clintons right remember when he was impeached for lying he cant practice law he doesnt have the right to practice law didnt we just go through this and the last thing we need is another four years of obama thats the last thing  and this will be worse that means isis that means high taxes that means bad health care that means no border without a border we dont have a country the work of government would grind to a halt if she were ever elected shell be in court for her entire tenure and shell be convicted because look the first time  i mean frankly forget about this time the first time she gets a subpoena from the united states congress and she deletes everything there shouldnt have been a second time but i have respect that the fbi has given it a second chance and this time i have no doubt that in that  emails  did you see where they said oh were not worried theyre duplicates how can there be duplicates if there are hundreds of thousands more than you started off with   so today i guess wikileaks it sounds like is going to be dropping some more and if we met tomorrow ill tell you about it tomorrow but one beauty thats been caught was and this was just recently newly released where they say having a dump were having a dump of all of those emails  in another communication bill clintons chief of staff says foreign government  right this should be another one just like swamp  you know the swamp little statement   this one this one do you remember what it is right all the money is in right they said all the money is in theyre talking about foreign money pouring into their pockets they said all the money is in  this is what is running for office honestly she should be ashamed of herself she should be ashamed of herself my contract with the american voter begins with a plan to restore honesty to our government that includes a ban on foreign lobbyists raising money for american elections makes sense i want the entire corrupt washington establishment to hear and to heed the words we all will be saying right now when we win on november th we are going to washington dc and we are going to drain the swamp  gonna drain the swamp were gonna drain the swamp folks were gonna drain that swamp   another important issue for americans is integrity in journalism these people are among the most dishonest people ive ever met spoken to done business with these are the most dishonest people  there has never been dishonesty  there has never been dishonesty like weve seen in this election theres never been anywhere near the media dishonesty like weve seen in this election dont worry they wont spin the cameras and show the kind of massive crowds they wont do that   the very talented michael goodwin of the new york post just wrote today that  presidential race will mark the lowwater mark of journalism that is worthy  think of it  of the first amendment never before have so many media organizations old and new abandoned all pretense of fairness to take sides and try to pick a president  its unbelievable its unhonestly  for instance we have a great story we give it out to the media theyll make it look as bad as possible  as bad as possible parenthetically   so sad parenthetically and very sadly earnings for the new york times are down  percent this year they just announced that  so bad i feel so badly for them just announced   percent oh theyre doing great and then they tell you who to vote for you know who to vote for they want crooked hillary this isnt about me its about all of you and our magnificent movement to make america great again all over this country and theyre talking about it all over the world at the core of my contract is my plan to bring back jobs  right now  million american women and children live in poverty or near the brink of poverty fortythree percent of african american schoolaged children live in poverty thirtytwo percent of hispanic schoolaged children live in poverty this is america this is the united states this is unacceptable as your president i will go into the poorest communities and work on a national plan for revitalization  we will replace decades of failure with generations of success florida has lost one in four of its manufacturing jobs since nafta a deal signed by bill clinton and supported by hillary  and heres a number that you should remember because its not even a believable number and its correct america has lost  factories since china entered the world trade organization another bill and hillarybacked disaster we are living through the greatest jobs left in the history of the world our jobs are going to mexico our jobs are going to other countries china and others are making our product we dont make it anymore a trump administration will stop the jobs from leaving america and we will stop the jobs from leaving florida  my second home you know that im here all the time my second home great place the theft of american prosperity will end so they are stealing our prosperity horribly stealing our prosperity a trump administration will renegotiate nafta and well stand up to foreign product dumping all over the place  currency manipulation by china and many other countries and all of the unfair subsidy behavior thats going on all over the world against us we will also immediately stop the jobkilling trans pacific partnership a disaster  and hillary wants it to happen she called it the gold standard then she rejected it but shes going to approve it then she lied during the debate right she lied  she lied during the debate she said she never called it the gold standard she lied and she lied about the line in the sand right she lied as part of our plan to bring back jobs were going to lower taxes on american business from  percent to  percent  we will also cancel billions in global warming payments to the united nations   and use that money to support americas vital environmental infrastructure and natural resources were spending hundreds of billions of dollars we dont even know whos doing what with the money were gonna spend the money here were gonna work on our own environment  that includes repairing the herbert hoover dike at lake okeechobee and protecting the florida everglades  we will become a rich nation again but to be a rich nation we must also be a safe nation  a terrible tragedy today has occurred in iowa you read you saw early this morning two iowa police officers outstanding outstanding people were murdered ambushed ambushed violently while sitting in their squad cars we send our thoughts and prayers to the family of the fallen i just left iowa most beautiful place the treatment was so incredible the crowds the police officers were so incredible the job they did now two of them are dead an attack on our police is an attack on all of us  law enforcement is the line separating civilization from total chaos you have to remember that  according to the national law enforcement officers memorial fund firearm related police  were up  percent this year the highest theyve ever been and there have been  ambush style attacks this year alone never had anything like this and what it is is a lack of respect for our nation its a lack of respect for our leadership to all the great men and women of law enforcement i want you to know were with you we support you and we will stand by you  we will restore law order and justice in america  justice   thank you thank you so good luck to the people of iowa we will also work with our federal and local law enforcements to keep america safe from terrorism  hillary clinton wants a  percent increase in syrian refugees pouring into our countries  her plan would mean generations of terrorism and extremism spreading in your schools and all throughout your communities when im president we will suspend the syrian refugee program   and we will keep radical islamic terrorist the hell out of your community  now we all have heart and were gonna build safe zones and were gonna have some of the gulf states that have nothing but money theyll put up the money well lead it well build safe zones but we have enough problems in our country she wants to increase the thousands and thousands that are pouring in right now she wants to increase that number by  percent and then you wonder why podesta says she has bad instincts and you wonder why bernie sanders says shes got bad judgment theyre right shes got bad judgment personally i think shes a very unstable person if you wanna really know the truth  and were gonna repeal and replace obamacare but you wanna know something honestly i think for herself shes got much bigger problems right now than obamacare shes got bigger problems  lets see whats on all those emails that they just found see whats on those emails   thank you its too bad those cameras arent turning around to see this incredible group of people with thousands more outside isnt it too bad  they dont do it but you know if hillary speaks and theres  people in the line they say the crowd is massive  shes never had a crowd like this in her life  president obama shouldnt be campaigning for any longer its really a conflict right he oughta be working on jobs on the border on building up our military instead of campaigning for crooked hillary clinton is what he oughta be doing  hes in north carolina but were going to north carolina right after this so  but we have a few more today in florida and we have massive crowds theres something happening theyre not reporting it katie youre not reporting it katie  but theres something happening katie theres something happening katie a trump administration will also secure and defend the borders of the united states and yes we will build the wall  thank you  weve received the first ever endorsement from our ice and border patrol officers first time theyve ever endorsed a presidential candidate  they tell us the border crisis taking place right now is the worst its ever been now in all fairness people probably figure that im going to win  so theyre racing across the border i dont know im sorry to do this to you folks  hillary has pledged totally open borders meaning you dont have a country anymore and she strongly supports sanctuary cities like in san francisco where  right where kate steinle was killed by a five time deported illegal immigrant  the immigration officers warn that hillarys plan is the most radical immigration proposal in us history and that it will lead to the loss of thousands of lives and i believe that as secretary of state hillary clinton allowed thousands of the most dangerous and violent criminal aliens to go free because their countries would not take them back  countless innocent americans have been killed by illegal immigrants last year as an example yearold starlett pitts her boyfriend and her mother were stabbed to death in their lee high acres home by an illegal immigrant the killer had been convicted of assaulting a police officer and was wanted for double murder and robbery and the people that knew him were begging that he be incarcerated they were begging he was released from custody pending his court appearance enabling him to commit murder a trump administration will stop illegal immigration deport all criminal aliens and save american lives    and i want to thank by the way i see all these signs  cubans for trump cubans i love cubans  so they gave me last week the bay of pigs association right you know they gave me their award last week and it was a great honor and were gonna fight very hard for the cubans and were gonna fight very very hard for the hispanics because they have not been properly taken care of  whats happened with the hispanic population in our country is not right whats happened with the inner cities of our country the africanamerican community the hispanic community is very very unfair  thank you thank you were going to take care of it the crime is horrible the education is terrible and you cant get a job were going to fix the inner cities  were going to fix the inner cities thank you fellows thats so good blacks for trump thats so nice we will also repeal the obamaclinton defense sequester and rebuild our badly depleted military  that includes total support for homestead air reserve base a trump administration will stand in solidarity with the suffering people of cuba and venezuela all surrounding dural   all surrounding dural  against the oppression of the castro and maduro regimes you know what im talking about we will cancel obamas onesided cuban deal made by executive order if we do not get the deal we want and the deal that people living in cuba and here deserve   including protecting religious and political freedom right im honored to have the endorsement of over  top admirals and generals and  medal of honor recipients  you know its really called peace through strength peace through strength thats what were going to have well hopefully have to get rid of isis  were going to get rid of isis dont worry were getting rid of isis but we have to get to rebuild our country weve spent six trillion dollars in the middle east  six trillion dollars and its in far worse shape by a factor of  from when we started six trillion  we lost lives the most incredible great people our new foreign policy will put america first hillary brought disaster to iraq and syria and libya and she empowered iran remember shes got bad judgment and she unleashed isis came right out of the vacuum now she wants to start a shooting war in syria in conflict with nucleararmed russia frankly it could lead to world war iii and she has no sense shes got no instinct but thats decided  hillary and our failed washington establishment theyve spent that six trillion dollars i mean id love to have that money back but id much rather have all those lives back  rather have all those lives  love to have those lives back but the middle east is in bad shape folks and its getting worse totally getting worse theyve dragged us into foreign wars that have made us less safe theyve left our borders wide open at home and theyve shipped our jobs and wealth to other countries and these are foreign wars that we dont win  we dont win we dont win anymore we dont win with trade we dont win with wars we dont win anymore were going to start winning again you watch were going to start  to all americans i say its time for new leadership just think about what can be accomplished in the first  days of a trump administration were going to have the biggest tax cut since ronald reagan  and she is going to raise your taxes very substantially i think you know that  we will eliminate every unnecessary jobkilling regulation cancel every illegal obama executive order rebuild our military and take care of our great veterans  provide school choice and put an end to common core were bringing our education local  support the men and women of law enforcement  were going to save our second amendment which is under siege   and appoint justices to the united states supreme court who will uphold and defend the constitution of the united states  clinton wants us to think small wants us to believe things cant change and wants our lives to revolve around washington i wonder if shes going to be there much longer what do you think  i dont think so i dont know im not sure shes going to be there but she wants  she wants our lives to revolve around washington dc im asking you to dream big to push for bold change and to believe in a movement powered by the people and by their love for this great country  im tired of politicians telling americans to defer their dreams to another day when they really mean another decade america is tired of waiting the moment is now all we have to do is stop believing in our failed politicians and start believing in each other and in our country  there is no challenge too great no dream outside of our reach dont let anyone tell you it cant be done the future lies with the dreamers not the cynics not the critics certainly not the media  hillary has been there for  years and she has accomplished nothing shes just made things worse look at her record shes the candidate of yesterday we are the  right is that right   we are the movement of the future our movement represents all americans from all backgrounds and all walks of life we are asking for the votes of republicans and democrats and independents and first time voters and believe me there are a lot of first time voters that are standing on line right now  were asking for the vote of every american who believes truth and justice not money and power should rule the day and i understand the other side very well ive been there for a long time but i love our country and i understand what has to be done we are going in the wrong direction and if we keep going in this direction we wont have a country any longer  were fighting for every citizen who believes that government should serve the people not the donors and not the special interests were fighting to unlock the potential of every american community and every american family who hope and pray and yearn for a better future with your vote we are just  think of it  six days away  this started on june th of last year its a long time seems like a long time ago but were six days away from the change youve

thing will never happen again theres never been a movement like this in the history of our country  theres never been a movement like this   thank you thank you there has never been a movement like

tomorrow  the new la times poll highly respected has us up six points nationwide and i have some more really interesting and great breaking news to share with everyone here today no its not that  but that will be that its just been announced that in the month of october weve raised over  million in small donations i dont think thats ever been done has that ever been done before  that sounds more like a democrat thing not a republican thing right thats a great honor that means there are a lot of people out there that want us to really get this done and ive contributed a tremendous amount of money but when we have those small dollars  and  and  when that money comes in and then we raise around  million thats a tremendous compliment to everybody here it really is it really is these are donations from everyday patriotic americans who love their country and want a better future for their children who are going to have it  our movement is about borders and is about bringing back our jobs you know about that from this area  its about reducing taxes and raising incomes our movements about defeating isis we have no choice we have no choice  we want to rebuild our country but theyre chopping off heads theyre drowning people in steel cages we have no choice and keeping our country safe from radical islamic terrorism  its a movement about restoring respect for america and for the american flag  were disrespected right now all over the world but that will change very very quickly it really will it really will well get along with a lot of countries that right now we do not get along with and that frankly take advantage of us from now on it will be america first folks america first  finally its a movement about taking our government back   thank you thank you theres an amazing love for our country i see it all over this great land   thank you i love you too thank you  its a movement about taking our government back from the donors the lobbyists and the special interests and giving that power back to the people  and in case you didnt know ive been on the other side for a long time and i saw where the country was going it was headed in the wrong direction and i love this country and i just said were going to have to do it its not easy its not easy i have to put up with some of the most dishonest people in the world the media  they never show crowds like that look at that it goes all the way back they never show crowds they dont show crowds  but i guarantee you one thing folks i guarantee you one thing if we had a small crowd if for some reason a little small group of people showed up it would be the biggest story out there that i can tell you  these are really dishonest people and they are not happy with whats going  this was not in their game plan folks they are not happy  dishonest media among the most dishonest people and i was sad to see the new york times lost  percent down profits  percent  ninetyseven percent down and then they tell you who they want for president right we know better real change begins with immediately repealing and replacing obamacare  its just been announced that the residents of florida hate to tell you this are going to experience massive doubledigit premium hikes i know what those hikes are  should i tell you lets keep it  i want you to leave happy tonight knowing that were going to make america great again ok  and in the very near future its going to be gone obamacare so dont worry but i wont tell you what the number is youre not going to be happy when you hear the number in the great state of arizona premiums are going up more than  percent i just left arizona great people unbelievable place their premiums are going up more than  percent all of the counties in the florida panhandle will have only one single obamacare insurer to choose from next year good luck with that negotiation not so lucky dont worry dont worry its going to be gone fast but think of it now do you know how much theyre going to make this is what they dream of they all wanted to be on theyre all gone theyre all gone youre going to have one to deal with its a disaster in minnesota where the premium increase will be close to  percent the democratic governor has said and hes gotten a lot of heat for saying this the affordable care act is no longer affordable that was last week premiums are surging companies are leaving insurers are fleeing doctors are quitting and deductibles are going through the roof other than that its actually quite good  what a shame and i said it from the  ive said a lot of things from the beginning you have to say you know they said about hillary shes got bad instincts right you know who said that podesta i would fire podesta so fast i mean the way he talks about her you know whether true not true who cares he speaks so badly about her of course he didnt know that there was a thing called wikileaks right he didnt know about that  but he said shes got bad instincts and she does have bad very bad instincts and bernie sanders what did he say got bad judgment shes got bad judgment shes got bad instincts shes got bad judgment thats not going to be your president if we dont get rid of obamacare it will destroy american health care forever yet hillary clinton wants to doubledown on obamacare making it much more expensive than it already is  im asking for your vote so we can replace obamacare and save health care for every family in florida and the united states  real change also means restoring honesty to government do you think hillarys going to restore honesty to government i dont know  i dont think so folks as you know the fbi has reopened its criminal investigation into hillary clinton    all right is your sound turned back up  you know what they do they turn the sound down when youre doing that are you guys back did you put your sound back up  hillary wants to blame everyone else for her mounting legal troubles but she has no one to blame but herself hillary is the one who set up an illegal private email server to shield her criminal activity hillary is the one who endangered national security for you your family by sending classified information on an insecure server hillary is the one who lied so many times to congress and to the fbi hillary is the one who made  phones disappear some with a hammer and who destroyed  emails after receiving a congressional subpoena thats after after unbelievable but i have a feeling those    emails  i have a feeling those emails are going to be  whoa there are going to be some beauties in there can you imagine shes been deleting all the time deleting and then they say yeah we have a problem what they just found  emails now you cant have  for the wedding and for the yoga right you cant its too many  no thats a big number you know when you hear that many e mails then you wonder why she never gets anything done i guess thats part of the reason hillary is the one who accepted debate questions given to her by donna brazile   in advance of a debate and now its turned out to be two debates with bernie sanders can you imagine bernie sanders if that happened to me it probably did although we won the debates anyway i dont think it matters i dont think it matters  but can you imagine that bernie sanders keeps supporting her i think eventually hes going to say i cant do it i mean honestly if somebody got the debate questions on me and i found out about it and they only found out about it through this whole deal with wikileaks but if somebody found out that for me i would never want to be speaking with that person again i would imagine its only a question of time hopefully before the election that bernie sanders says thats one of the most dishonest acts because hillary never reported it as a breach she got the questions and she never reported it and they dont say that these people all they do is talk about donna brazile who cares about donna brazile who cares about her its not donna brazile she was dishonest by the way did you see her on television the other night trying to answer that one that was called choking let me out of the studio please  oh boy oh boy oh boy what a country but were going to make it respected again were going to make it great again im telling you  but hopefully at some point bernie sanders will do the right thing and some of his people have told me how can he continue to support her when she cheated  when she cheated  on the debates hillary clinton is the most corrupt person ever to seek the presidency and if she were elected it would create an unprecedented constitutional crisis you know whats going to happen and in all fairness we went through it with the husband he was impeached his law license was taken you know he cant represent you if you want a lawyer you cant even use him his license was taken away folks do we want to go through this again   and do we want for more years of obama thats what its going to be   you know what that means isis running around all over the place higher taxes no borders a depleted military no were going to change it around hillary is likely to be under investigation for many years probably concluding in criminal trials  and through wikileaks today its just been shown that this is as ive been saying a rigged system with more collusion possibly illegal between the justice department the clinton campaign and the state department right you saw that just came out the emails show that the assistant attorney general who is involved in the investigation has been feeding information directly to john podesta who he knows very well and the clinton campaign folks folks its a rigged system ok its a rigged system then they say oh isnt that terrible when donald trump you know like  its a rigged system my contract with the american voter begins with a plan to end government corruption  it includes a ban on foreign lobbyists raising money for american elections i think we can keep them out we have enough problems with our elections lets keep them out my plan also includes a constitutional amendment to impose term limits on all members of congress  i want the entire corruption washington establishment to hear and heed the words we all have to say  we all and by the way folks im a messenger im just a messenger this is a movement like theyve never seen by the way i have been an effective messenger in all fairness but that also  but im a messenger im a messenger when we win on november th we are going to washington dc and we are going to drain the swamp   believe me i told people you know over the last week andahalf ago that came out i said i cant say that that is so hokey  i said im not going to say it anyway so a weekandahalf ago i said it the place went crazy i said whoa then i said it at the next meeting we had a tremendous rally someplace and i said it and the place went totally crazy  and then i said it again same thing and then i said to myself boy im glad i thought of that expression thats a great expression  i tell this story frank sinatra frank sinatra didnt like my way he didnt like my way but he sang it and the place went nuts then he did it again and again and again then it became number one and you know what he decided he loves that song very much  at the core of my contract is my plan to bring back our jobs  florida has lost one in four of its manufacturing jobs since nafta a deal signed by bill clinton and supported by hillary clinton  heres a fact thats so hard to even fathom america has lost  factories since china entered the world trade organization another bill and hillarybacked deal and i have to say about china i do a lot of business with china i do a lot of business with china we can do great with china and i dont disrespect them im not angry at them because theyve taken advantage of our country im angry at our leaders for allowing them to do it  our leaders have allowed them to manipulate their currency devalue their currency theyre masters theyre grand masters nobodys ever done it like china others do it japan does it brilliantly also but nobodys ever done to us what china has and we have  the biggest bank in the world is a tenant of mine in manhattan its a china bank its the numberone bank in the world and i do business with china in the bank of america building in san francisco through china and so many things and dealing with china is fine but you have to have people that are knowing what theyre doing because what china has done to our country they have taken our money they have taken our jobs they make our product and we owe them  trillion thats sort of amazing right they take our money and we owe them so thatll all change and you know the amazing thing now in the south china sea theyre building a massive massive fortress probably like nobodys ever seen right in the middle of the sea and i dont think they asked for environmental impact statements do you do you think they went through the twoyear review period   you know what they went through about a minute review period but theyre building right in the middle of the south china sea they shouldnt be doing that and we treat them very well because we let them do all these things that we could stop very easily and by the way we have tremendous power but we dont know how to use it so were going to get along better with china were going to get along better with mexico what mexico is doing to us between the border and the kind of trade deficits we have with mexico and by the way so many other countries were going to be the smart people again were going to be the smart people again  were living through the greatest jobs theft in the history of the world we really are a trump administration will stop the jobs from leaving america and we will stop the jobs from leaving florida  the theft of american prosperity will end theyre taking away our wealth a trump administration will renegotiate nafta and we will stand up to product dumping unfair subsidies and currency manipulation and well win well win it wont even be hard  we will end the foreign cheating and protect every last american job we will also immediately stop the jobkilling transpacific partnership that hillary clinton would love  thatll be the end of your jobs completely thats a disaster certainly the way its structured is a total disaster as part of our plan to bring back jobs were going to lower taxes on american business from  percent to  percent  we will also cancel billions in global warming payments to the united nations  and we will use that money for american and its so important for american environmental infrastructure we want folks we want clean air crystal we want clean water crystal i want crystal clean water clean air we want safety beyond that thats what we want the rest of the world they take our money they laugh at us our businesses can no longer compete because some of the restrictions we want clean air we want clean water we want safety we spend billions and billions of dollars  and well be replacing unless you dont want to do it the  mile bridge do you want to do that do you care because if you dont care lets save the money ok should we do it or not tell me should we do it  well youre more excited about building the wall that i can see  and we will unleash the power of american energy including shale oil natural gas and clean coal were going to put our miners back to work and were going to put our steelworkers back to work  we will become a rich nation again but to be a rich nation we must also be a safe nation  hillary clinton wants a  percent increase in syrian refugees   and virtually unlimited immigration from the most dangerous places in the world to come into our country her plan would mean generations of terrorism radicalism and extremism spreading in your schools and throughout your communities when im elected president we will suspend the syrian refugee program  and we will keep radical islamic terrorists the hell out of our country i can tell you that weve got enough problems  we have enough problems and you know what we all have a heart and we see whats going on the world is unbelievable whats happening and well build safe havens and well get the money from the gulf states they have so much money they dont know what to do with it and they havent exactly been putting up so well get the money from  we owe  trillion if you dont mind im going to lowkey it a little bit ok does that sound ok to everybody   but well get the money to the area well get it over there and well build safe havens   i think hes on our side that guy right i always say friend or foe usually its friend other than the ones that the clintons hired the thugs right for  apiece   and a cell phone go and try and beat up as many people as you can remember that around chicago and then theyre blaming me donald trumps rallies are very very violent and you hardly heard about that story and honestly those people should be prosecuted you had policemen walking out with gashes in their head those people should be prosecuted because we have the friendliest rallies we have such love at our rallies those people should be prosecuted  did you see the guy who was in charge of that program visited the white house like  times did you see that  he visited the white house i think it was  times right but he said yeah but i only saw the president  times oh well thats ok so im sure the president didnt know anything about the violence right and hes got to stop campaigning for crooked hillary hes got to go back go to the office and hes got to produce jobs and hes got to help the military build up i mean depleted hes got to look at the borders i mean this guy all he wants to do is campaign for hillary its unbelievable i think he may be hurting her more look the bottom line is nobody wants four more years of obama  a trump administration will also secure and defend the borders of the united states and yes we will build what were going to build the wall   and heres a little quiz im sure youre never going to be able to guess this who is going to pay for the wall   how did you guess they dont know it yet but theyre paying for the wall we received the firstever endorsement from our ice and border patrol officers a tremendous number of people first time theyve ever done it  the immigration officers warned that hillarys plan is the most radical immigration proposal in us history and that it will lead to the loss of thousands and thousands of lives thats a quote as secretary of state hillary clinton allowed many many people the most dangerous and violent criminals aliens to go free because their home countries intelligently said we dont want them back and were not going to take them back so our guys would be over theyd bring them there theyd say we dont want them were not taking them get out and shed accept them back and then put them on the streets and you know whats happened you know whats happened i promise you this whether its four years or eight years not once when we bring criminals back to a country not once will that country say take them back not once believe me  not once hillary wants totally open borders there goes your country and has pledged mass amnesty in her first  days very unfair to all of the people that want to come in and by the way i want people to come in i want tremendous numbers of people to come in and were going to have that big beautiful door in the wall but you know what they have to come in through a process they have to come in legally  they have to come in legally and well have merit involved too wouldnt it be nice if we went a little bit on the merit system we take people that are really going to help us grow our country wouldnt that be nice  somebody said you cant say that thats not politically correct well i just said it folks  hillary strongly supports sanctuary cities like san francisco   where incredible kate steinle was murdered by an illegal immigrant who had been deported as least five times a trump administration will cancel all federal funding to sanctuary cities  we will end illegal immigration keep the drugs from pouring into our communities and deport all criminal aliens from our country we will also fully eliminate the obamaclinton defense cuts and completely rebuild our badly depleted military which we desperately need  that includes brandnew modern aircraft for pensacola naval air station wouldnt that be nice for your great young pilots  i watched a documentary a couple of months ago and i saw that it was a documentary on how old our aircraft is our fighter craft and they cant get parts they dont make parts anymore these are fighters that were currently using these great great people that fly these planes they cant get parts because they dont make them anymore they get the parts from the museums they get the parts from the airplane graveyards and i said this the united states the enemy has plans that are far better than ours so were going to change all of that so get ready get ready pensacola  and we will always ensure that the blue angels  i love the blue angels   continue to inspire our nation the blue angels i mean those guys are serious fliers i never quite  when the wings are that  i never quite got it but they have great talent no different than anything else theyre great theyre blessed with great great talent we will also build the ship navy that our country has been asking for and our admirals have been asking for  and well have an active duty army of  troops  our military policy will be based on three very important words peace through strength  we dont want to use it we want to have it we dont want to use it we do have to get rid of isis folks but we dont want to use it other than that im honored to have the endorsement of more than  top admirals and generals and  medal of honor recipients and a lot more coming a lot more coming  our new foreign policy will put america first hillary brought death and disaster to iraq syria and libya she empowered iran and she unleashed isis you ever notice where she says we will fight isis during the debates you know then she walks out and not good not good she left wasnt good but shes going to fight isis shes the one that let it start so isis started as nothing then obama called it the junior varsity you remember and now its in  countries and shes going to stop it next hillary wants to start a shooting war in the syrian conflict with a nucleararmed opponent named russia that could seriously lead over syria to world war iii and putin does not like her and she is just not respected   that was quite funny the woman screams we dont like her either  who said that thats pretty cool who said it you you look so innocent i cant believe it wow we dont like her either no we need strength hillary and our failed washington establishment have spent  trillion on wars in the middle east wars that we never win wars that just cause death destruction we never win we dont win anymore we dont win with wars we dont win with trade we dont win were going to start winning again like you havent won in a long time  and now the middle east after spending this  trillion   trillion we could have rebuilt our country twice  and now the middle east is in worse shape than its ever been before its a mess i mean its not even its not even its far worse than it ever was theyve dragged us into these endless foreign wars that have made us much less safe theyve left our borders wide open at home and theyve shipped our jobs and wealth to other countries to all americans i say its time immediately for new leadership it is  and just in closing think think were all leaders were all doing this together   thank you thank you thank you very much its a great honor to be with you tonight i have to tell you this is a great area this is an amazing area somebody said oh thats trump all the way that whole area i love this area this is an amazing area  they did a poll of your area and ill tell you we are through the roof  in fact i have to be honest my geniuses said mr trump sir dont come there everyones voting for you there you dont need to go there youve got their vote i said thats why i want to go there dont you want to reward people for being your friend right  dont go there i want to go here its true see people forget you know its one of those things i want to be here this is  i think you people are amazing you built this country folks you built this country  just think about what we can accomplish in the first  days of a trump administration were going to massively cut taxes for the working and middleclass americans hillary is going to raise your taxes substantially by the way its right there  we will eliminate every unnecessary jobkilling regulation we will cancel illegal and you know its crazy the illegal obama executive orders theyre all over the place theyre pretty bad  we will rebuild our military and take care of our great veterans  we are going to provide school choice and put an end to common core bring our education local  we will support the great men and women of law enforcement i met a lot of them backstage well save our second amendment which is totally under siege got to get out and vote thats a big thing  the national rifle association gave me their earliest endorsement that theyve ever given and wayne and chris and all of the people there i want to tell you folks people can dispute people can argue but they love this country the national rifle association and i know the top people they love this country they really do they love the country so just remember that when people go after them and you know so often but they really do have a great love and i want to appoint and were going to appoint justices to the united states supreme court who will uphold and defend the constitution of the united states  the time has come to cut our ties with the failed petty policies of the past hillary clinton has been there for  years and shes accomplished nothing shes just made things worse during our debate she complained about my taxes i said hillary you were there change it but she wont do that because all of her donors do the same thing as i do so shes never going to do it so i felt very strongly i said hillary youve been there for years change it shes not going to change it she doesnt do anything she complains she complains shes the candidate of yesterday we are the movement of the future  were asking for the votes of republicans democrats independents and firsttime voters of which we have a lot of them im telling you we have a lot  all you have to do is look at those long beautiful lines all over florida and youre going to see a lot of them have hats that have a little phrase right what does that phrase say make america great those lines are long and theres  by the way last poll has us up four but i think they really know its much higher than that you know they dont even have to poll now all they have to do is look at the lines right they dont want to do that were asking all americans to join this incredible movement were fighting for every citizen who believes that government should serve the people not the donors and not the special interests were fighting to unlock the potential of every american community and every american family who hopes and prays and yearns for a much better future were going to bring back our jobs folks were going to bring back our jobs  im asking you to dream big because with your vote we are just do you believe this six days away six days  six days i started this in june june th of last year it seemed like it would take forever of course you know the pundits all said donald trump has no chance hes got no experience at this  well every once in a while some of them that knew us theyd say be careful what you wish for a couple of them said it i wont mention their names but i was complimented they said be careful and then one by one right one by one by one by one and then we have some great people ben carson has been so incredible  so many chris christie has been great but we have great support mike huckabee i watched him on television the other day hes been so great  no no we have great support we have great

and my father great people  i had great parents great parents i know theyre up there watching i just felt that nice breeze its hot but i just felt that nice breeze   so theyre helping us out and i just want to say thank you to both of them special special people ive had a great life and now i want to give back to the country that i love its time we have to  we have to give back folks   ive seen how the career of politicians the big donors and the special interests have bled this country dry and stripped our middle class and stripped our companies of its jobs and its wealth but were just six days away from delivering justice for every forgotten man woman and child in this country  justice for every child trapped in poverty in the inner cities for every family thats born  and you know that theyve been born into a situation in some case they cant get out of it were going to get them out of it were going to get them out of it we have endless wars every communitys hopes and dreams have been shattered and were not going to let that happen our inner cities are going to come back and  theyre going to come back strong and your going to see what i mean  and the africanamerican community and the hispanic community are really understanding whats going on and you see that right now you see that right now in  whats happening at the polls were winning in florida were winning in ohio were winning in iowa in north carolina were doing great in pennsylvania a lot of people are saying pennsylvanias looking very good so many different places we just got a poll  with three  up  in virginia  but we are seriously up in florida thats very important so  and i will never ever let you down real change begins immediately with repealing and replacing obamacare a  disaster  a disaster  it is a disaster its just been announced that the residents of florida are going to experience a massive double digit premium hike  i will not tell you what the number is i know the number very well but i want you to leave happy you dont want to hear the number go home relax wake up good and strong tomorrow morning youll learn youre not going to like it in the great state of arizona where we just left the  premiums are going up more than  percent  over  percent of the counties in florida  and by the way in the primaries i won  out of  primaries thats good  i was going to try and exaggerate and say i won them all but i cant do  that  over  percent of the counties in florida are losing obamacare insurers next year theyre leaving theyre all leaving in minnesota where the premium increase will be close to  percent the democratic governor has said the affordable care act is no longer affordable obamacare is a total catastrophe   yet hillary clinton wants to double down on obamacare making it even more expensive   im asking for your vote so we can replace obamacare and save healthcare for every family in florida so important  real change also means restoring honesty to our government  as you know the fbi has reopened its investigation into crooked hillary clinton  hillary wants to blame everyone else for amounting legal troubles and i dont see if youve watched her last few speeches over the last few days she has become totally unhinged unbelievable what shes saying and what shes doing is actually its unbelievable but she has no one to blame but herself hillary is the one who set up the illegal private email server to shield her criminal activity hillary is the one who engaged in a corrupt pay for play scheme at the state department hillary is the one who lied so many times to congress and to the fbi hilary is the one who made  phones disappear some with a hammer and who destroyed  emails after  after after after receiving a congressional subpoena think of that   unbelievable   and as you know they just found  listen to this and i guess you know it  emails   and i would say that classified confidential i think theyre probably all over the place i think theyre  i think theyre gonna find a treasure trough i cant even imagine in fact they said well this is ok theyre duplicates how could there be duplicates when its many more times what we thought was stolen in the first place right you know when they deleted  i thought that was a lot they have  hillary is the one who accepted debate questions given to her in advance and used them to cheat   instead of reporting the breach thats a big deal you know to me thats a big deal some people say oh thats fine thats a big deal thats really  thats a real cheater ok thats a cheater and she was given the questions by a woman that frankly should resigned from the dnc or be fired   but thats a really big deal and you notice they never  the dishonest prospect the most dishonest    if you notice they never go after hillary they always talk about donna brazile donna brazile didnt do it but can you imagine if i got  can you imagine they gave the questions to donald trump before a debate  you know it would be the electric chair theyd reinstitute the electric chair no itd be headlines all over the world this isnt headlines i bring it up its brought up a little bit but this isnt like a big deal she got the debate questions and answers but she got the debate questions prior to a debate now bernie sanders should be angry right shouldnt he be angry now ill tell you what the system is rigged the system is rigged ive been saying it for a  its rigged and were gonna straighten it out but the system is rigged hillary is not the victim the american people are the victims of this system  so corrupt in so many ways and this is your one chance to change it because you know what in four years not gonna happen theres no way the numbers wont work in four years theres no way hillary clinton is the most corrupt person ever to seek the presidency and if she were to be elected it would create an unprecedented constitutional crisis i mean before you go into phase two  lets call what happened on friday phase two phase one shes so guilty she shouldnt be allowed to run for the presidency thats why i say the system is rigged she shouldnt be allowed to run but i have a feeling in the  emails theyre gonna find things that you will not even believe who knows  emails no wonder she cant do anything no no how do you work how do you do it  theyll have to explain that to us some day but theyll have some things in there that i can just imagine are going to be unbelievable hillarys likely to be under investigation for many years probably concluding in a criminal trial out today wikileaks just came out with a new one just a little while ago its just been shown that a rigged system with more collusion possibly illegal between the department of justice the clinton campaign and the state department you saw that the emails show that the assistant attorney general whos involved in the investigation has been feeding information directly to john podesta and the clinton campaign can you believe this  she shouldnt be allowed to run by the way behind me the great johnny damon the curse of the yankees but ultimately he helped the yankees johnny damon stand up   now ill tell ya george steinbrenner was a good friend of mine oh he didnt like johnny too much then he ultimately signed him and then he was fine he did great but johnny damon was a champ he was a winner and he loves this area you know that my contract with the american voter begins with a tough ethics reform and it ends  ill tell you what we are going to end  we have no choice we really have no choice  government corruption its going to end  i want the entire corrupt washington establishment to hear and to heed the words we all will say right now when we win on november  we are going to washington dc and we are going to drain the swamp  at the core of my contract is my plan to bring back our jobs florida has lost one in four of its manufacturing jobs since nafta a deal signed by bill clinton with the support of crooked hillary  america has lost  this is so hard to believe   factories since china entered the world trade organization another bill and hillary backed disaster we are living through the greatest jobs theft in the history of the world a trump administration will stop the jobs from leaving america and we will stop the jobs from leaving florida theyre leaving were going to stop it and you have an excellent governor by the way hes fighting hard for you folks i dont know  i dont know all i can tell you is he is a worker he is a worker and hes fighting very hard the theft of american prosperity will end and itll end ill tell you we are  it is being stolen from us folks it is  we have a oneway highway right into mexico right into other countries and were going to stop it from now on its going to be america first  america first  its going to be america first   a trump administration will renegotiate nafta and we will stand up to foreign product dumping currency manipulation and all of the unfair subsidy behaviors its horrible whats happening to us our politicians dont have a clue they dont know what theyre doing  or other things ok we will also immediately stop the job killing transpacific partnership as part of our plan to bring back jobs were going to lower taxes on american business from  percent to  percent were the highest taxed nation in the world killing our jobs our companies are leaving killing our jobs we will become a rich nation once again but to be a rich nation we must also be a safe nation in orlando the murder rate doubled you know that doubled last year can you believe it we will support our police and i met you police of orlando they are unbelievable people and theyve been through a lot i met the police and these are unbelievable people we will bring this crime wave to an end we will also keep our community safe from terrorism just a short time ago orlando was the victim of the worst mass shooting in american history during the islamic terror attack on the pulse nightclub it was also the worst attack on the lgbtq community in our countrys history cant let it happen cant let it happen hillary wants to increase by  percent syrian refugees pouring into our country  her plan would mean generations of terrorism radicalism and extremism spreading in your schools and throughout your communities when im elected president we will suspend the syrian refuge program  and we will keep radical islamic terrorists the hell out of your community  got to keep them out and well build safe zones in syria we have to help the people were going to build safe zones but the gulf states havent been doing their thing and believe me they have plenty of money theyll help us theyll fund it im sure theyll be thrilled theyre going to be funding it and that will be ok we want to help people but we have enough problems in this country we dont need orlando and problems we dont need what happened in san bernadino we dont need whats happening in paris in nice and in germany  which is a disaster we dont need it we have enough problems right now do we agree we have enough problems we dont need it a trump administration will also secure and defend the borders of the united states  and yes we will build a great wall    we received the first ever endorsement from our ice and border patrol officers great people the officers that warned that hillarys plan is the most quote radical immigration proposal in united states history and that it will lead to the loss of thousands and thousands of lives quote as secretary of state hillary clinton allowed thousands of the most dangerous and violent criminal aliens to go free because their home countries were intelligent they wouldnt take them back we bring them to their countries  murderers drug dealers gang members wed bring them to their countries and their countries would say get them out were not taking them back they call up the state department and the state department under hillary clinton would say oh bring them back we dont want to make waves i guarantee you whether its four years or eight years that will not happen once under a trump administration  hillary wants totally open borders and strongly supports sanctuary cities like san francisco where kate steinle  incredible young woman  was murdered by an illegal immigrant who had been deported five times a trump administration will cancel all federal funding to sanctuary cities immediately we will end illegal immigration deport all criminal aliens  the ones we just spoke about  and we will save american lives we will also repeal obamaclinton defense sequester and rebuild our very badly depleted military  that includes major new investments in resources from pensacola naval air station at macdill air force base have you ever heard of those places pretty good places a lot of people here lot of people im honored to have the endorsement of   more than that now much more than that  top admirals and generals and  medal of honor recipients great people ive met so many of them theyre incredible incredible people our new foreign policy will put america first hillary and our failed washington establishment have spend  trillion on wars in the middle east that we never won and that never end and its now in worse shape than ever before the middle east is a catastrophe its far worse off than had we spent nothing theyve dragged us into foreign wars that have made us less safe theyve left our borders wide open at home and theyve shipped our jobs and wealth to other countries and its  its disappearing our country in a certain sense is disappearing prosperity  real prosperity is disappearing we owe  trillion our trade deals we lose  billion a year on trade we have trade deficits think of that who negotiates these deals you know who does stupid people stupid people  with very stupid leadership who by the way they campaign all the time hes campaigning right now for crooked hillary  why is he campaigning shes under federal investigation and weve got a president campaigning for her and thats all he does is campaign he ought to be working on your jobs that are leaving and going to mexico and your military  ill tell you what first of all shes got bigger problems but four more years of obama we cant take it folks four more years of isis thats what it is four more years of no jobs now she wants to start a shooting war in syria and conflict with a nucleararmed russia that could very well lead to world war iii russia is heavily armed doesnt like her putin does not respect her doesnt like her what are we doing folks shes a mess to all americans i say its time for new leadership  just think about what we can accomplish in the first  days of a trump administration  thank you its so beautiful over there i just noticed the water lets go in for a swim its about  degrees out there anybody want to go swimming lets go  we are going to have the biggest tax cut since ronald reagan and hillary wants to increase your taxes by a tremendous amount you know were already the highesttaxed nation in the world she wants to increase your taxes if you can believe that one were going to eliminate every unnecessary jobkilling regulation killing your companies killing them one of the reasons theyre leaving cancel every illegal obama executive order  were going to rebuild our military and take care of our great great veterans theyre not being taken care of you know that a lot of veterans here were going to take care of our veterans finally they have been mistreated for many many years were going to support the men and women of law enforcement  we will save the second amendment which is as you know under tremendous siege  we will appoint justices to the united states supreme court who will uphold and defend the constitution of the united states  we will show the world that there is no challenge too great no dream outside of our reach theres no dream  no dream outside of

just say theres some good ones ok there are some good ill tell you what you take a look at the media these are the most dishonest people anywhere  these are the most  they  the media  the media is a part and one of the vital cogs in the rigged system under which we live theyre a big fat cog in the  and they never show the crowds they never show whats happening but you know what you hear  when you hear  sometimes  when you hear people sounds like youre at an ohio state football game  but they never show it they never show it  they never show it people of florida we love you all we have to do is

almost everywhere i think  give us two more days i think were going to be winning everywhere  and im almost starting to think that the least important problem that hillary has is the fact that were winning i think shes got perhaps bigger problems than even that  were fighting for every citizen who believes that government should serve the people not the donors and nor hillarys special interests  we are fighting to unlock the potential of every american community and every american family who hope and pray and yearn for a much better future  i am asking you to dream big  i got to dream big

minutes ago the new rasmussen poll has up  up right now  up nationwide  were leading in florida were leading in ohio were leading in iowa i think were leading in north carolina  which is big doing well in pennsylvania right there but we are leading all over i tell you what we are going to have something thats going to be very special get out there on tuesday dont fail who has already voted by the way  thats pretty good its about  percent  got to vote were on the cusp of something thats so amazing its historic change a transfer of power from a failed political establishment were going to return that power to you the american people  there is more breaking news that id like to share with you right now  it was reported last night that the fbi is conducting a criminal investigation into hillary clintons    pay for play corruption during her tenure as secretary of state in other words the fbi is investigating how hillary clinton put the office of secretary of state up for sale in violation of federal law  the investigation is described as a high priority  its farreaching and has been going on for more than one year it was reported that an avalanche of information is coming in  the fbi agents say their investigation is likely to yield an indictment    but just remember the system is rigged just remember that  and reports also show the political leadership at the department of justice is trying to protect hillary clinton and is interfering with the fbis criminal investigation  by comparison fourstar general just last week james cartwright highly respected is in very serious trouble for doing a tiny fraction of what clinton did may go to jail for up to five years think of it general cartwright last week fourstar general respected by everybody a tiny tiny fraction may go to jail for now five years and general petraeus life and reputation has been destroyed for doing nothing nothing by comparison to what hillary clinton did she shouldnt even be allowed to run for the office of president  she shouldnt be allowed and that is where the system is rigged she shouldnt be allowed it was also reported that the laptops of clintons top aides which had been slated for destruction were not in fact destroyed good job by the fbi  and that the fbi has been successfully using them to gather information for their criminal investigation  further they have found new emails as part of the  e mails just recently found can you imagine  see what do these people do no wonder nothing gets done in government   i guess shell say those  remember the  well the  also the wedding and some yoga right  finally it is believed that no less than five foreign intelligence agencies successfully hacked into clintons illegal insecure server which contained classified information creating an ongoing security threat to the united states   think of what happened to so many people for doing so little by comparison think of it   hillary clinton has engaged in a massive farreaching criminal conduct and equally farreaching coverup she created an illegal email server to shield and guard her activity so simple so simple shoulda happened a long time ago folks now were going through phase two which sounds like its even worse than phase one shoulda happened in phase one but she was protected by the department of justice  she illegally transmitted confidential information and then lied about it to congress she illegally destroyed federal records including  emails after receiving a congressional subpoena   and she made  phones disappear some with a hammer  who in this room has gotten rid of a phone and then smashed the hell out of it with a hammer anybody raise your hand please raise your hand i see one hand over there i see a hand there what business are you in i want to know no i dont wanna know i dont wanna know i dont wanna meet him  she engaged in corrupt pay for play at the state department for personal enrichment she lied to the fbi and she lied to the american people many many times  remember she lied  times i dont recall i dont recall well those are all lies because she recalled every one of them these are sad events for our country a highranking government official has been caught selling her public office threatening national security and engaging in a massive criminal coverup if she were to win it would create unprecedented constitutional crisis   here we go again with clinton you remember the impeachment and the problems shes likely to be under investigation for many many years also likely to conclude in a criminal trial this is not what we need in this country folks we need somebody thats going to go to work to bring our jobs back to take care of our military to strengthen up our borders  this is not what we need its going to be a mess and they say it they say it this is going to be a mess for many years to come before they figure it all out we dont need that we need a president thats gonna go in and do their job  and i just left by the way miami and in leaving i see air force one so i said to myself i wonder who that could be  and its our president  and hes down here campaigning for crooked hillary  now why why isnt he back in the office sometimes referred to as the oval office why isnt he back in the white house bringing our jobs back   and helping our veterans   right why why isnt he back working hes campaigning every day and i actually think considering that she is under criminal investigation i think hes actually got a conflict  and one of the things it taught us wikileaks he knew she had a lot of wrong things going on you know that that also came out obama knew what was going on by the way just in case you didnt know he knew this guy oughta be back in the office working hes not gonna be there very long thank goodness but he oughta be back in the office working  we dont win anymore as a country we dont win with our military we dont win on trade this guy oughta get back to the office and stop campaigning  if we win on november th we will once again have a government of by and for the people  real change begins with immediately repealing and replacing obamacare  its just been announced that the residents of florida are going to experience a massive doubledigit premium hike whos got their number yet does anybody know  should i tell you do you want me to depress everybody you just put your head down start crying and leave i wont tell you i dont want to tell you you know why because if i do youll be so depressed i dont like people leaving a speech early crying  youre not going to like it folks in the great state of arizona though as an example premiums are going up more than  percent and it doesnt work obamacare doesnt work im repealing it were gonna replace it with something so much better and so much cheaper  hillarys going to double up over  percent of the counties in florida are losing obamacare insurance next year think of it good luck in that negotiation in minnesota where the premium entries will be close to  percent the democratic governor said the affordable care act is no longer affordable oh did he take heat him and bill clinton did bill clinton take heat he said its crazy obamacare he said its crazy they lied to us the president lied to us  times he said you can keep your doctor you can keep your plan remember he kept lying and lying and lying  premiums are surging companies are leaving insurers are fleeing doctors are leaving and deductibles are through the roof sometimes  in other words you have to spend  before you start using it obamacare is a total catastrophe yet hillary clinton wants to double down on obamacare she doesnt want to terminate it she doesnt want to get rid of it she wants to double down making it much more expensive than it is right now and its right now ridiculous  its your number one cost right now bigger than your mortgage its bigger than your rent first time thats ever happened im asking for your vote so we can replace obamacare and save healthcare for every family in florida and our country  so important real change also means restoring honesty to government hillary was given the debate questions in advance by donna brazile by the way  can you imagine if those questions because the dishonest media  among the worlds dishonest people by the way  its not even a big story mainstream media hardly covers it they hardly talk think about it she got the debate questions against bernie sanders probably got the ones against me too but we won that debate very easily those debates  we won those debates  i dont care if she got em except that it shows how dishonest but think of this supposing i got the debate questions it would be front page of the washington post it would be front page of the new york times he must immediately withdraw from the race what he did is disgraceful ill tell you what they dont even write about it so donna brazile was fired from cnn  thats good but why wasnt she fired from the dnc because what she did was totally dishonest did you see her on television the other night she couldnt answer uh well where did he get em where did he get em where did you get em shes going thats the questioner was asking that where did you get those questions where did you get em well uh i got em well i got em  i dont know where i got em i tell you what she should be fired she should be fired but much more importantly hillary clinton should be fired  hillary clinton  because donna brazile couldnt answer the questions she looked like a fool on television but she couldnt answer the questions but you know what was worse she took the questions and gave em to crooked hillary    thats cheating and crooked hillary instead of saying im sorry i cant accept them we have to report this incident she took the questions went in and had good answers for bernie at some point doesnt bernie sanders get tired of it theyre calling him all these names theyre cheating on him doesnt he tell his supporters to go vote for trump at some point right  and i havent seen one story where hillary clinton  they blame donna brazile a little bit very little but seriously can you imagine if it was me that got those questions  you know what ive been saying they would reinstitute the electric chair right front page news front page news shes a very dishonest person probably the most dishonest person ever to run for the office of president i really believe  i believe that  the clintons are the sordid past and someday theyll start writing about these dishonest people back there someday they will ask the question and they will do a front page headline why didnt hillary clinton report that she got the confidential guarded questions to a debate and someday these dishonest people are going to write a story about it in mainstream media  but were the bright future my contract with the american voter begins with a plan to end government corruption  we understand that i want the entire corrupt washington establishment to hear and heed the words we all have to say we all of us its a lot of us theres a lot of us this is a movement theyve never seen this before in this country thats why we dont want to blow it now tell them because youre allowed to vote early but we dont want to blow it on november th because this is a movement like theyve never seen before all of em even the ones that dislike me of which there are quite a few of those people but all of em this is a movement like theyve never seen in the country   but it will end quickly it will end quickly if we dont go out to vote on november th so lets not let it end lets keep it because were going to make america great again folks  were going to make america great again  when we win on november th we are going to washington dc and we are going to drain   the   swamp   right at the core of my contract is my plan to bring back our jobs theyve been stolen  florida has lost one in four of its manufacturing jobs since nafta a deal signed by bill clinton and supported by his lovely wife hillary  america has lost  listen to that number i thought it was a typo for weeks ive been saying it  factories since china entered the world trade organization another bill and hillary backed deal were going to get em back folks dont worry  were living through the greatest job theft in the history of the world its what it is greatest  think of it greatest job theft in the history of the world a trump administration will stop the jobs from leaving america and we will stop the jobs from leaving the state of florida i can tell you quickly very quickly  the theft of american prosperity will end and we dont mind that its  degrees in this room right do we mind    it is hot in this room but you know what thats ok we lose a couple of pounds not the worst thing in the world right from now on its going to be america first  a trump administration will negotiate nafta and we will stand up to foreign product dumping currency manipulation and all unfair subsidy behavior which is a lot  we will also immediately stop the jobkilling transpacific partnership a disaster another disastrous potential deal  as part of our plan to bring back jobs were going to lower taxes on american business from  percent to  percent  we will also cancel billions in global warming payments to the united nations billions and billions of dollars  and use that money to support americas environmental and national infrastructure  by the way folks were sending billions and billions of dollars were making our companies noncompetitive other companies are  throughout the world are killing us and other countries dont adhere to whatever theyre supposed to do but were sending all of this money heres what we want we want crystal clean water  we want immaculately clean air  and we want great safety  above that folks lets go to town and lets employ a lot of people  were going to spend a lot of money on our infrastructure including the deepening which you need of the harbor at jackport  do we all know jackport   we will become a rich nation once again but to be a rich nation we must also be a safe nation  in chicago  people have been shot since january st think of that think of that almost  people  people have been shot since january st   nationwide murders have experienced their largest single year increase in  years now the press doesnt tell you that because the press is guarding hillary clinton and the press doesnt want them and doesnt want you to know the real facts about your jobs about all of the things  about our military which is now bogged down in mosul remember i said why cant we ever like go in there quietly secretly and do the job right  remember i said the element of surprise and they came oh what does trump know about  i know plenty believe me theyre bogged down its a tough situation four months ago were going into mosul i kept saying every time i turn the television off i say oh why do they have to say it were going to get the leaders of isis were going  and its four months were going in because we believe the leaders of isis are in mosul four months  three months ago we are going into mosul were gonna get those leaders problem is after we said it the first time within about  minutes they were gone  we are led by stupid people remember that stupid people  stupid people  wouldnt it be nice if we didnt talk we did the job and you had the news conference a week later wouldnt that be nice  to announce good results these are not good results a trump administration will work with local and federal law enforcement to end this growing crime wave its very substantial every child in america has the right to grow up in safety and in peace  we will also keep you safe from terrorism  hillary clinton wants a  percent increase in syrian refugees coming in to the country  theyll be pouring into the country thats above obamas unbelievable thousands and thousands coming in her plan would mean generations of terrorism and extremism spreading across our schools and your communities and thats one of the reasons we have all those women for trump signs ok believe me  the women dont want this and by the way i have to tell you i think i have tremendous support from women tremendous very tremendous  look we have tremendous support  were going to keep our country safe you know they say well what will you do for women i say start off with were going to keep our country safe is that good is that a good starter  i think were going to do tremendously with women were doing tremendously with africanamericans you see that you see whats going on you see it  you see whats going on theyre very  you know these characters in the back theyre very discouraged because all these lines people with hats on saying make america great buttons shirts  but big reports about tremendous support from groups that i was not supposed to have as much support from its throwing  its throwing them a little bit off balance theyre not happy theyre not happy the protected one is not being very well protected  when im elected president we will suspend the syrian refugee program and we will keep   we will keep radical islamic terrorists the hell out of our country ok believe me well keep em out  and well build safe havens and well do things over in syria well get other countries to pay for it we have  trillion in debt but well get the gulf states they have a lot of money they got a tremendous money theyll pay for it i promise  because we have to take care of people but honestly we have enough  hey folks we have enough problems in this country look at whats happening to germany look at whats happening to france look at paris  i have a friend every year he goes to paris i havent seen him in a while paris oh the city of lights he used to tell me for years paris paris i see him like a month ago how was paris this summer oh i dont go to paris you kidding me  its no longer paris he hasnt been there in a long time were gonna have our country be great again folks ok were gonna to have smartness   were gonna do it  were gonna do it properly were gonna do it properly were gonna  were gonna do it through love were gonna do it in a lot of different ways but were gonna have our country be great a trump administration will also secure and defend the borders of the united states  and yes we will build a great wall    and mexico which is making a fortune with us just a fortune at the border and through trade deficits our trade deficit with mexico is enormous just in case you  well its enormous with everybody why should they be any different in all fair  mexico will pay for the wall ok believe me they will pay for the wall   percent  they might not know it yet but theyre paying for the wall we received the first ever endorsement from our ice and border patrol officers  they tell us the border crisis is the worst its ever been its a national emergency the immigration officers warned in a letter that hillary clintons plan is the most radical immigration proposal in us history and that it will lead to the loss of thousands and thousands of lives thats what they wrote us as secretary of state hillary clinton allowed many many people the most dangerous and violent criminals in the world to go free because their home countries very intelligently wouldnt accept them back so we take a killer a drug lord a vicious gang member bring them back to their countries and theyd say turn that plane around and get em out of there  and hillary clintons state department would say oh well thats too bad oh well well accept em and they go in our streets and they kill people  hillary clinton supports  and i guarantee you one thing    in four years or eight years i guarantee you one thing there wont be one instance not one where one of these murderers or drug people or gang members not one instance folks where that plane will come back with that person on that plane i guarantee you that there wont be one instance  hillary clinton supports totally open borders there goes your country and strongly supports sanctuary cities like san francisco where kate steinle was murdered by an illegal immigrant who was deported at least five times  and were putting very very strong language in its going to be submitted the first day im in office when they come in once we deport em when they come in twice they go to jail for five years  when they come in another one itll be  years and you know whats gonna happen sort of pretty simple they here they get caught again they go to jail for five years just whats gonna happen theyre not coming back folks  now our people dont want to do it our weak weak politicians dont wanna do that a trump administration will cancel all federal funding to sanctuary cities  we will end illegal immigration we are going to stop drugs from pouring into your communities and poisoning our youth and everybody else   and we will deport all criminal aliens quickly from our country we will also repeal the obama clinton defense sequester and rebuild our badly depleted military  were gonna rebuild it  our navy is the smallest it has  have you heard this i mean to me this is sad and then you wonder why china whos making a fortune with us they make our product they take our money and theyre fine i have a great relationship ive made a fortune with china i had the biggest bank in the world is a tenant of mine in new york china biggest bank in the world from china but you know what you know what theyre building right now a tremendous fortress in the south china sea theyre not supposed to be doing it but theyre doing it because they have no respect for obama they laugh at hillary they think  they think hillarys a joke shes a joke  she is a joke you know what they dream they dream they go to sleep at night these tough leaders you know theyre tough and smart theyre smart and really tough they go to dream at night they go to sleep and they dream that hillary clinton becomes president thats what their dream is  ive made a lot of money with china im not sure they like the idea of me ill be honest but thats ok and well get along great with china well get along with china better now i guarantee they wont be building forts in the middle of the sea totally against everything you know theyre so  what theyre doing is such a big violation but they have no respect for obama and they no longer respect our country our navy is the smallest it has been since world war i we will build the  ship navy that our country needs and desires and must have  that means brand new stateoftheart ships in places like mayport right here in jacksonville  im honored and this is a great honor for me to have the endorsement of more than  top admirals and generals and  medal of honor recipients  im also honored to have the greatest temperament that anybody has because we know how to win  she spends  billion she spends so much money i see these ads people that know me they say how can they say that now we have  you know what we have a temperament because  we have a certain temperament its a temperament of knowing how to win  its knowing how to win the leaders of our country boy you talk about temperament and interestingly whether its podesta or bernie sanders podesta said hillary has bad instincts and ill be honest ive read the things that he has said about hillary on the wikileaks  and if i were hillary i would fire podesta so fast he says such demeaning things about her shes got bad instincts i mean youve read some of the things its incredible you know how do you have people working for you and then you have to deal with them and it was all behind her back he must be a bad guy i dont know but to say the things he said about her she should look at him say podesta youre fired  but she cant do that she probably needs him as a witness in the criminal case so she cant do it  our new foreign policy will put america first hillary brought death and disaster to iraq syria libya she empowered iran and she unleashed isis you know she wants to get rid of isis shes the one that started it it came through the vacuum now its in  countries and i watched her during the debate meekly talk about isis and i said to her youve been here for  years hillary you started isis you were secretary of state when it started why are you going to get rid of it you cant get rid of anything you dont know what youre doing now she wants to start a shooting war in syria in conflict with a nuclear armed russia that could very well lead to world war iii and remember putin has no respect for her either has no respect for her   doesnt like her doesnt respect her doesnt respect obama and doesnt like him hillary and our failed washington establishment have spent  trillion on wars in the middle east wars we never win and now its in worse shape than ever before wars we never win folks theyve dragged us in to foreign wars that have made us lessly  and they took us they opened up our borders you know its interesting we fight for their borders but at home we have open borders try and figure that one out we fight like hell for their borders we spend trillions of dollars to do it but at home we have open borders  and theyve shipped our jobs on top of everything and our wealth to other countries thats gotta end very quickly  our jobs are coming back and our companies arent leaving and if our companies wanna leave there are consequences if they wanna go to mexico or some other country or build a plant and make air conditioners like carrier is doing or build cars like ford is doing ford is moving an entire mess of division down all small car production they wanna do that you tell them very nicely im sorry you know i always joke that i wanna make those calls so badly i dont want to put anybody in charge of those calls theyre so easy  and theyre short and our politicians should have done this for years but you tell them that when you make your air conditioner or your car whatever it might be you build in mexico enjoy the weather when that car or that product comes through our very strong border now it will be a very strong border there will be a  percent tax  and you know whats going to happen nobodys going to leave folks now the politicians know this but theyre all taken care of by those special interest groups that want that to happen but there will be a  percent tax and nobodys leaving and the ones that do leave thats ok too well make a lot of money but nobody says it does anybody say it like trump right   so simple to all americans i say its time for new leadership just think about what we can accomplish in the first  days of a trump administration  were going to have the biggest tax cuts since ronald reagan and hillary is raising taxes very substantially shes raising your taxes were going to eliminate every unnecessary jobkilling regulation we will cancel every illegal obama executive order  were going to rebuild our military and take care of our great great great veterans  theyve never been taken care of properly  suicides a day not gonna happen were gonna take care of our veterans and i appreciate all the support i get from the military theres a big article today on the front page of the new york times and they say why does trump have support from the military and by the way and law enforcement and by military i mean including big leagues our  our veterans you know how many veterans are here right now  a lot  yeah a big big story the veterans the military and law enforcement were going to provide school choice and were going to put an end to common core were going to bring our education   we are going to support the great men and women of law enforcement were going to support em  were gonna save our second amendment which is under siege  great people you know we have the endorsement of the nra its great these are great people  the earliest theyve ever given and we will appoint justices to the united states supreme court who will uphold and defend the constitution of the united states so important so important  it is time to cut our ties with the failed and bitter politics of the past   hillary clinton has been there for  years and she has accomplished nothing  just words and just made things worse   she is the candidate of yesterday its going to be really interesting to see what happens to her    i wonder so let me ask you let me ask you she shouldnt be allowed to run based on the email scandals and all them ok  so let me ask you this questions ive never done this before will justice be done or not will justice be done yes or no  hard right i dont know i dont know im not sure anybody knows the answer   theyre protecting her and its very  we are the movement of the future our movement represents all americans from all backgrounds and all walks of life  were asking for the votes of republicans democrats independents and firsttime voters of which there are many  we are fighting for every american who believes in truth and justice not money and power ill tell you we are going to rule the day this group we are going to rule the day this group and many many many like you every place we go every place we go the love of this country is incredible   thank you we are fighting for every citizen who believes that

105,"Trump","thank you very much everybody thank you these are wild times  these are wild times wow what a beautiful building and place and all these people but honestly we always have a lot of people they just want to see this country do the right thing again you know that were going to do the right thing  were going to be a smart country again very soon i want to begin by thanking my amazing wife melania i dont know if anybody saw her today she got up and gave an incredible speech and she  she did a great job that takes  takes a lot of courage takes a lot of courage in five days were going to win the great state of north carolina and we are going to win back the white house  great state great people and the polls have been amazing one just came out the rasmussen poll were three points up nationwide  were leading in ohio were leading in iowa were leading in florida were leading in north carolina which is  were leading  just came out two minutes ago two polls were leading in new hampshire  were sort of leading all over the place its a great honor  its a great honor honestly and this is not an easy thing to do you know that but we had to do it you have to do it we have to do it were all doing it together so i just want to thank you its like we have no choice we have no choice  well hopefully you voted or youre going to vote early but youre going to vote but remember november th so important and you get out there early if you can real change begins with immediately repealing and replacing obamacare you know that  its just been announced that the residents of north carolina are going to experience a massive doubledigit premium hike  in the great state of arizona  where i just left  premiums are going up  percent theyre not happy ninetyfive of  north carolina counties will only have one insurer in the obamacare exchange next year which is a catastrophe frankly lots of luck in that negotiation by the way folks dont worry about it itll be dead well kill it and were going to start all over again with a great one  youll be spending a lot less money for much much better health care much much less money in minnesota where the premium increase will be close to  percent the democratic governor said the affordable care act is no longer affordable premiums are surging companies are leaving insurers are fleeing doctors are quitting and deductibles are through the roof you know some people have   deductible yet hillary clinton wants to double down on obamacare making it even more expensive  itll be much more expensive   did you ever see anything like whats going on right now if we dont get rid of obamacare it will destroy health care in north carolina and all over the united states it will be the end im asking for your vote so we can replace obamacare and save health care for every family in north carolina and frankly in the united states  real change also means restoring honesty to government where we have a problem with hillary  there is important breaking news from last night it was reported that the fbi is conducting a criminal investigation into hillary clintons payforplay   corruption at the state department this is in addition to the fbis criminal investigation into her emails   emails they say the federal bureau that its likely to yield a very very serious charge or an indictment im just saying thats what the newspapers are saying  thats what the reports say however it was also reported that the political leadership at the department of justice is trying to protect hillary clinton  telling fbi agents to stand down and is interfering in the fbis criminal investigation  perhaps thats what happened the first time i would imagine thats whats happened further its believed that no less than five foreign intelligence agencies successfully hacked into hillarys illegal insecure server in other words hillarys corrupt criminal scheme put the safety of every american family in danger thats whats happened hillary clinton is engaged in farreaching criminal conduct and in an equally farreaching criminal cover up including the destruction of  emails after receiving  after  after can you imagine can you imagine if i did that they would say he must immediately leave this race oh boy thirtythree thousand emails were deleted after receiving a congressional subpoena that alone folks  thats not the new group thats the old group that alone is big problems for which she got away with murder honestly she has no right to be running you know that no right  but now shes got bigger problems if she were to win it would create an unprecedented constitutional crisis that would cripple the operations of our government she is likely to be under investigation for many years and also it will probably end up  in my opinion  in a criminal trial i mean you take a look who knows but it certainly looks that way certainly being spoken of americans deserve a government that can work and really has to work for them from day one well do that my contract with the american voter begins with a plan to end government corruption  the plan includes a constitutional amendment to impose term limits on all members of congress  it also includes a lifetime ban on government officials becoming lobbyists for a foreign government id say that makes senses  that sort of makes sense right i think so makes sense i want the entire corrupt washington establishment to hear and heed the words we  we as a group  all say right now when we win on november th were going to washington and we are going to drain the swamp  were going to drain the swamp at the core of my contract is my plan to bring back your jobs that have been taken away  theyve been taken away north carolina has lost nearly half of its manufacturing jobs since nafta a deal signed by bill clinton and supported by hillary  the worst trade deal ever signed in the history of the world believe me america has lost  i never believe number when i give it  but americas lost  factories   you wouldnt think its possible seventy thousand factories since china entered the world trade organization another bill and hillarybacked disaster were living through the greatest jobs theft in the history of the world we are nobody has every lost jobs like we do defective contracts negotiated by political hacks we have the greatest business people greatest negotiators in the world in this country we dont use them we use political hacks that gave a contribution or a campaign contribution they end up getting jobs this is whos dealing with china with  how about iran how about the new iran deal done by  started by  started by hillary clinton and finished off by our great bicyclist our great bicycle racer  hes in a bicycle race he breaks his leg in the middle of the negotiation i promise you i will never enter a bicycle race i promise i swear i swear  i now have nearly  and think of this one cause i cant even believe it  we have an   almost   billion a year annual trade deficit with the world ok eight hundred billion whos negotiating these deals whos  whos negotiating these deals dont worry itll change  itll change weve got carl icahn weve got the greatest negotiators in the world itll change so fast and these guys  i have some of the best business leaders in the world they do it for sport they dont want money they  theyll do it for sport  the same special interests who shipped the jobs out of america are the people whove given hundreds of millions of dollars to hillary clinton  now i just got back from florida i was begging for like a regular commercial ivory snow heinz ketchup every commercial was a hit on trump hit hit hit and almost all of them were untrue some were pretty good actually but the most negative  its horrible and really i mean so much fabrication when you see the rusted out factories and empty buildings here just remember hillary clintons policies and the policies of her people did this to you just look at the devastation pillowtex laid off  people and took their jobs to mexico and other countries freightliner one of your companies laid off  people in mount holly and moved their jobs to mexico you know mexico i was there three months ago i met with the president of mexico nice guy really good well have a great relationship but mexicos like a oneway street its a one  they take the money the jobs the factories you know we get drugs and unemployment is what we get flextronics    all right its a little early in this speech but i promise we will build the wall believe me  little early i wasnt up to that part but you know what i wont be able to shut you up unless i say that right we will build the wall and what mexico will pay for the wall  flextronics laid off  workers in charlotte and moved their jobs to mexico and china and various other countries a trump administration will stop the jobs from leaving america there will be consequences  and we will stop the jobs because you people have been affected much more than most from leaving north carolina and i have great successful place in north carolina in charlotte right outside of charlotte right trump national its great lot of employees i pay them a fortune theyre very happy they do an unbelievable job its a real success look at this  look at this my members i have members i have  good do i do a good job do i do a good job  wow thats fantastic thank you thats so nice i didnt know that sort of interesting i bought it for very little i didnt you know i just  i bought it out of a bankruptcy its this gorgeous job they did a good job but they  they got caught and i fixed it ii spent a lot of money on it right i fixed it and now its so successful and everybody loves it she said on schedule under budget  its true its true thank you shes right about that thats good well its great to have you here thank you very much you know its a great success and its just a great state you know its very interesting so i have a lot of workers theyre all over the country and when i buy things  though i dont think im going to doing this too much longer im going to be running something else much more important  but these workers they travel theyre all over and they travel to different place even to different countries theyre great theyre crews and theyll come in and they came to north carolina and i said howd you do felix  howd you do leo  how are you hows it going they said mr trump when we retire we want to come to north carolina they loved it its funny they never said that  theyve been to so many different places so theres something about north carolina thats special and that area that is so good so we love it the theft of american prosperity will end on november th believe me from now on its going to be america first if a company wants to fire their workers in north carolina or in this country move to another country and try to ship their product back into the united states we will apply a  percent tax to those   and you know whats going to happen right theyre not leaving they wont leave when that happens they will not leave and if they do thats ok too cause were going to make a fortune all right although their formula wont work  their formula wont work its so simple to do its so simple to stop and these people havent wanted to do it a lot of reasons number one in some cases theyre not smart but in other cases theyre getting so much money from the special interests and the donors that want it to happen because they may own the company et cetera et cetera that theyre not looking for the best interest of our company and you know what im going to have over  million in this campaign i dont care about these people you know the special interests i used to be the ultimate special interest i mean in all fairness i know the other side very well i also love our country and our country was going bad it was going bad no more deals with iran where we give them  billion back  where we give them  billion in cash how about that one you know what that would be thats like you fill it up to the ceiling i tell you what its hard to believe so  so we did this and were happy we did it and weve created a movement remember this like nobody has ever seen in this country before ever newt gingrich was on and he was talking well if you go back  years there was a movement you know im saying  years but its  its been a great honor i have to tell you its been a great honor and a great pleasure and ive gotten to know the people of this country and they are unbelievable  theyre unbelievable right theyre unbelievable people and were going to  and i say it every once in a while were going to have apple and other great companies start making their product in the united states ok  were going to do it a trump administration will renegotiate nafta and if we dont get the deal we want we will terminate nafta and get a much better deal for our workers much better and by the way just to set the record straight because the crooked media  you talk about dishonest people these are the worlds most dishonest people i believe in free trade  they have a very low rating right now folks hopefully ive helped in that you could have done the greatest thing in the world its like this total thing  im looking forward tomorrow to read those newspapers or im looking forward to seeing it on television something you do really really well and then you see it and they say man that was bad boy they made that look bad you know they are bad people ill tell you that  and they try so hard they try so hard to protect hillary clinton and you know what i think the gig is up i dont think its working any more dont think its working  no its not working too good we will also immediately stop the jobkilling transpacific partnership thats going to take the rest of your companies out as part of our plan to bring back jobs were going to lower taxes on american business from  percent to  percent  were the highest taxed nation in the world and were going to massively cut taxes for the middle class hillary clinton is going to raise taxes how can you do it were the highest taxed nation in the world she wants to raise taxes not going to happen folks were going to create something thats so beautiful the biggest since ronald reagan  biggest tax decrease we will also unleash american energy including shale oil natural gas and clean coal were going to put our miners back to work and were going to put our steel workers back to work our plan will end the epa which is a  hey look its all wonderful but its a disaster epa intrusion into your family farms and stop the double taxation of family farms at death you cant even pass them down to your children you cant pass small businesses down to your children very importantly we will also work to rebuild from the damage in your great state caused by hurricane matthew that was a rough one we will take care of our people were going to take care of the people of the united states we will become a rich nation again but to be a rich nation we must also be a safe nation hillary clinton wants a  percent increase in syrian refugees flowing into our country  not going to happen her plan would mean generations of terrorism and extremism spreading in your schools and throughout your communities when im elected president we will suspend the syrian refugee program  and we will keep radical islamic terrorists the hell out of our country  sorry we have no choice we have no choice right  a trump administration   great people a trump administration will also secure and defend the borders of the united states  be nice right be nice it would be nice to have borders dont you think right and we will build the wall as i  we will build it  itll be a great wall and the harder they fight the taller it gets ok i give you that im telling you the harder they fight the tougher it gets you know they tried to build a wall in like  you know that and hillary clinton was in favor of it and they couldnt get  you wont even believe this story  they couldnt get their environmental impact statement approved did you know that so here you have china in the south china sea building one of the great one of the biggest fortresses anywhere in the world ripping the hell out of the sea excavators they say the biggest ever used ripping the sea they conceived of the idea  listen to that you ok back there no no they conceived of the idea lets say on a monday night they started construction on tuesday morning right now they shouldnt be doing it theyre not supposed to be doing it it against everything we sort of have with them but they  boy this is a great group   say whoa  but china has no respect for us and russia has no respect for us and certainly no respect putin has no respect for hillary clinton he dreams  he dreams of her becoming president you know who else dreams of hillary clinton isis because isis formed while she was secretary of state in the vacuum that they left we should have never been in iraq but we should have never gotten out the way we got out and thats  that was the birth of isis now theyre in  countries and i watched her during debates the debates  did you see she had the debate questions to the other debate right  how about if donald trump had the debate questions right the electric chair right headlines trump to leave race we demand trump get out now they had donna brazile  she cheated did you see her on television she was unable to speak where did you get those questions but she cheated and they fired her from cnn which they should have but why arent they firing her from the dnc she cheated now but  but i have a much bigger question cause forget donna brazile she gave the questions to crooked hillary clinton right so  and this is two or three times dont forget they caught them like twice so they gave the questions she gave them to crooked hillary why didnt hillary clinton report it why didnt hillary clinton go to some ethics group  why you know why do you know why do you know why i know the answer you want to hear the answer because shes crooked hillary clinton  right very simple very simple crooked hillary   and then she does these phony commercials about me this and that give me a break crooked hillary we received the first ever endorsement from our ice and border patrol office first time theyve ever endorsed a presidency  they tell us the border crisis is the worst its ever been and i can see that although a lot of people are probably flowing in because they think im going to win so they say we better get this done right now the immigration officers warned in a letter that hillarys plan is the most radical immigration proposal in united states history and that it will lead to the loss of thousands of lives i see that its the most radical immigration plan in history as secretary of state hillary clinton allowed many many of the most dangerous and violent criminal aliens to go free because their home countries very intelligently would not take then back they didnt want killers they didnt want drug lords they didnt want gang members so we fly them into their country and their country says turn that plane around  or whatever theyre taking them in get out of here we dont want them cant blame them but i promise you that never once  whether its four years or eight years  never once  never once will we come back with somebody in that plane or whatever it may be when those people get out theyre getting out  and theyve hurt a lot of people hillary wants totally open borders there goes your country and strongly supports sanctuary cities like san francisco   where kate steinle was murdered by an illegal immigrant who had been deported probably more than five times in nearby landis north carolina yearold leanna newman and her unborn child were killed by an illegal immigrant drunk driver with two prior deportations leannas killer had two pair of dui convictions three convictions for driving with a revoked license a conviction for assault and numerous other charges and people that knew him said please incarcerate him a trump administration will impose tough mandatory minimum prison sentences for deported illegal immigrants  very tough requirements minimum sentences for deported illegal immigrants who come back into our country now if they come back in and we tell them youre out good luck dont come back but if you come back its five years then if they come back a second time its  years and then a third time its  years guess whats going to happen theyre not coming back right theyre not coming back  sort of simple its amazing what common sense can do isnt it we will also cancel all federal funding to sanctuary cities  and this crime wave its a tremendous crime wave will come to an end we will repeal obamaclinton defense sequester and rebuild our badly depleted military which we need so much  greatest people on earth in our military north carolina will be a major part of this effort with new advanced flying beautiful planes isnt it nice to have nice new planes from seymour johnson air force base anybody know it yes  marine battalions at camp lejeune  ive been to camp lejeune  and more troops and resources we will supply for fort bragg  im honored to have the endorsement of more than  top admirals and generals and  medal of honor recipients so we have many more coming  theyre not thrilled with hillary that i can tell you our new foreign policy will put america first hillary brought death and disaster to iraq syria libya she empowered iran and she unleashed isis with the vacuum  through the vacuum they came remember obama called them the junior varsity now she wants to start a shooting war in syria in conflict with a nuclear armed russia that could trigger world war iii she always talks about me see what i have is a winning temperament i have a winning temperament  hillary is an unstable person she is an  i think shes probably spent  million on phony ads the best thing i have is my temperament we know how to win  we know how to win  you got to know why you want to win too she has no idea and she doesnt win we dont win any more as a country we dont win at trade we dont win with our military  we cant beat isis  we cant beat isis isis will be defeated quickly you watch  and when we go in an attack a mosul if we have to do it  which we shouldnt because if we got out the right way we already had mosul and ive been complaining for four months from the time i heard it we will be attacking mosul in four months i said no dont tell me that maybe theyre not meaning it the element of surprise folks and you see how tough it is now were going to be attacking mosul because we think isil leaders are in mosul and if we attack them we will capture those leaders its four months right go i said why are they saying this these leaders  i mean look lets face it theyre pretty smart people right so i said why are they saying this whatever happened to the element of surprise why are they saying this and then three months go and then two months  and then i hear in two months now its one month and finally about a week two weeks ago i heard next week at about  were going to start the attack  these people are stupid theyre stupid people  and its turning out to be tough  its turning out to be tough because theyre tough as hell and theyre prepared theyre using human shields can you imagine this this is like not since medieval times chopping off heads drowning people in steel cages we have to do it killing christians if youre christian forget it killing everybody but why arent we fighting the right way why arent we fighting to win why arent we  why arent we doing things right hillary and our failed washington establishment have spent  trillion on wars in the middle east that we dont win and now its our worst nightmare weve spent  trillion we could have built our country twice  we could have rebuilt our infrastructure our country twice and forget about the  trillion the lives that have been lost the tremendous number of lives is there a doctor in the house please a doctor ok yes take your time please thank you thank you these are great people some of these people have been here for seven hours ok keep that fan going thats good thats good darling you

borders we fight for their borders but our borders we leave open explain it and theyve shipped our jobs and wealth to other countries our politicians to all americans i say it is time immediately for new leadership  so in concluding just think about what we can accomplish in the first  days of a trump administration were going to have the biggest tax cut since ronald reagan  were going to eliminate every single  every unnecessary job killing regulation the businesses youre  theyre putting them out of business and hillarys going for big big tax increases folks enjoy them were going to cancel every illegal obama executive order  were going to rebuild our very depleted military with the greatest people on earth working in our military  and speaking of great people we are going to finally take proper care of our veterans ok  its about time about time  were going to have school choice and were going to put an end to common core once and for all were bringing our education  we will support the men and women of law enforcement  these are great people   save our second amendment which is under siege   and appoint justices of the united states supreme court who will uphold and defend the constitution of the united states  its time to cut our ties with the failed and bitter politics of the past hillary clinton is the candidate of yesterday hey can we take another four years of obama   i dont think so  i dont think so remember three weeks ago they had  people that they were going to deport rough ones  these were rough ones these were rough ones they were all set and somebody made a mistake congratulations they became citizens of the united states of america  but that wasnt the only mistake because of  it became  people and i said that he said send them back i

106,"Trump","thank you very much thank you folks you know this is where it all began new hampshire this is where it all began  first victory this was our first victory and ive never forgotten it and i made a promise to you were going to keep the poison out you know what that is the drugs were gonna stop those drugs  right  right here is where i learned more about it than in any place else and we are gonna stop the poison from coming into this country  you watch you watch in four days we are going to win the great state of new hampshire   and we are going to win back the white house and weve had incredible polls youve probably seen the new rasmussen poll just came out were three points up nationwide and going like a rocket  many many polls i wont even go over all the polls but were leading in ohio and iowa all over the place  i think were doing great in north carolina i think were doing great in pennsylvania too by the way and florida looks beautiful florida looks beautiful we have so many great polls but you have to get out and vote on november th you have to do that were on the cusp of historic change that transfers power from a failed political establishment and returns that power to you the american people thats whats gonna happen  thats whats gonna happen theres more breaking news as you probably heard that id like to share with you right now is that ok  as you know the fbi now has multiple open criminal investigations into hillary clinton  this includes the discovery of another  emails and also a farreaching criminal investigation into her pay for play scheme at the state department last night cbs news just confirmed that the  emails include brand new emails not previously seen by authorities  she said she gave them all in right she said gave them all in well when we saw  we figured i guess there has to become surprises wait till you see what they find in those  too it wont be pretty hillary clinton lied to congress under oath when she said she turned over all her workrelated emails and that she didnt send classified information on her illegal server meaning she may now face major problems for perjury  how can hillary manage this country when she cant even manage her emails did you ever see  hey folks lets forget all of the stuff  what a mess  what a mess all she had to do was follow the rules and assume people are watching or listening who cares right what a mess and for what now were going to have her running the country for four years  what a  honestly what a terrible terrible mess over  over what over nothing over what should have been nothing all she had to do was follow the rules unbelievable and now she is going to run the country she will be under investigation for years she will be with trials our country we have to get back to work right   well one of her top people i guess her top person said  wikileaks said she has bad instincts what a bad thing bad instincts she should fire him honestly that would be good instincts but she should fire him john podesta in an email said hillary has bad instincts do you want that for your president then bernie sanders said  bernie sanders said bad judgment but in all fairness he was running against her so he said bad judgment but the guy thats running her campaign says hillary really has bad instincts then were going to say lets make her president the fbi agents say their investigation is likely to yield an indictment however the report also shows that the political leadership at the department of justice is trying as hard as it can to protect their angel hillary clinton why didnt they protect general cartwright and why didnt they protect general petraeus why didnt they protect a kid whos taking a couple pictures of a submarine  thats an old submarine and they put him in jail  they put him in jail  lovely family lovely mother they put him in jail because he wanted to have some remembrance of where he worked its an old submarine believe me they have pictures of that submarine that nobody knows about probably right they put him in jail and you see what she does and shes allowed to run for president folks do you know what it tells you the system is rigged and ive been saying that for a long time  the system is rigged she shouldnt be allowed to run hillary is engaged in massive criminal enterprise and coverup she created an illegal email server to shield her criminal activity and corrupt pay for play she illegally transmitted confidential information  youre just not allowed to do that forget about the second go round what shes in now the first go around youre not allowed to do it youre not allowed to delete after you get subpoena she illegally destroyed federal records including  e mails which she deleted after getting that subpoena from congress if she were to win it would create an unprecedented constitutional crisis what a mess i mean we went through it with him with the impeachment and the lies arent we tired of this stuff   she is likely to be under investigation for a long time concluding in a criminal trial our president america deserves a government that can go to work on day one and get it done  real change begins with immediately repealing and replacing the disaster known as obamacare  and obama you know he is campaigning all over the place i left miami yesterday there was the plane he is campaigning  he ought to be in the white house working and getting our jobs back and building up our military and creating some semblance of a border  which we dont have now its just been announced that americans nationwide are going to experience a massive double digit premium hike in obamacare in the great state of arizona  where i just left and ill be back  premiums are going up more than  percent arizona  percent over  percent of the counties in new hampshire are losing obamacare theyre losing the insurers and thats going to be next year so lots of luck negotiating folks  percent premiums are surging companies are leaving insurers are fleeing doctors are quitting and deductibles are going through the roof other than that its a fantastic health care fantastic  its really fabulous isnt it it was bad before they even did it you have to say im pretty consistent  i called a lot of things over the years right but i said obamacares not going to work before it was even approved and he got it approved  he got it approved by lies because he said you keep your doctor you keep your plan and even democrats that didnt want it they said all right well then and he got people  they wish they didnt approve it now believe me it is a catastrophe yet hillary clinton wants to double down on obamacare making it even more expensive than it already is and it doesnt work im asking for your vote so we can replace obamacare and save health care for every family in new hampshire and every family in this country  real change also means restoring honesty to government my contract with the american voter begins with a plan to end government corruption which theres plenty  first thing we have to do is keep hillary clinton out of office  that will be a good start i want the entire corrupt washington establishment to hear and heed the words we  all of us together  are about to say when we win on november th we are going to washington dc and we are going to drain the swamp    thank you thank you thank you very much at the core of my contract is my plan to bring back our jobs about time the terrible jobs report that just came out shows the number of people not in the workforce increased by another  people last month thats why you see these phony numbers about five percent unemployed people are stopping theyre not looking for work anymore because they cant get a job then they take them off the rolls these numbers are an absolute disaster labor force participation has fallen to its lowest level in nearly  years thats whats happening nearly one in four people in their prime working years are not working they want to work theyre not working after eight years obama is the first president in modern history not to have a single year of three percent growth were growing at any average of probably one to two percent nobody even knows and nobody believes the numbers anyway the numbers they put out are phony as far as im concerned for millions of americans its an economic nightmare new hampshire has lost one in four of its manufacturing jobs since nafta a deal signed by bill clinton and supported by hillary clinton  this is the one thats hardest to believe of all america has lost  factories since china entered the world trade organization you people know  new england boy do you know it another bill and hillarybacked disaster we are living through the greatest jobs theft in the history of the world and thats what it is when you think we have a one way highway right into mexico and these other places they take our jobs and they take our money they take out cash you know what we get out of it drugs and unemployment its going to end dont worry about it folks dont even think about it its going to end  dont forget  and i have to say this because i tell this story all over the place i learn so much in new hampshire because i see this place its so beautiful to me its one of the most beautiful places on earth you  nice beautiful winding roads  even the roads everythings so  the trees and the little lakes and streams and i sat down because i have so many friends up here because i worked hard during those primaries  remember i was supposed to lose the primary i won in a landslide right  remember they had the story  the day before it looks like trump could lose new hampshire and the numbers came out it was a land slide but what i learned is  because it was so  it was sort of shocking because i considered  you know i love this kind of look and i consider with the trees and the whole thing  so beautiful and i sat down with groups of people you know it wasnt always big rallies because id sit down with people say whats the problem every single group said heroin i said heroin because it didnt make sense to me you know you look at the streams and the lakes and the trees and then they say heroin and it was shocking thats why ive never forgotten it i never forgot those meetings in every single group and then i met with your police you have the great  you have such great law enforcement up here but they said the same thing  and so much of their crime is caused by drugs they come from the southern border largely and i said to you  i said to you and you remember this if i make it we are going to stop that problem and then were gonna work on all of the people who are so seriously addicted and there are things happening  you know there are things happening with medicines that the federal fda is not even releasing theyre not even releasing there are things that come out that potentially could really help but were gonna work on the people that have become so seriously addicted because its tremendous its not only our youth you know i say poisoning our youth but its a lot of other people but i learned that from new hampshire then i go to other states and they say very similar things but honestly never as much fervor as drugs in new hampshire and it just really had a great impact i said to you im gonna solve the problem if i get there and boy are we are getting close now were getting close right  true were gonna solve it when you see the rusted out factories and empty buildings just remember this hillary clintons policies and others like her her friends did this to us all of us just look at the devastation rockwell laidoff  people in manchester and moved their jobs to mexico fisher  and these are recent fisher scientific laidoff  people in hudson and moved their jobs to mexico the woman  i just overheard her say i didnt know that right now you know now you know she was a little louder than she thought thats ok  she didnt know now she knows car component technologies laidoff  workers in bedford and moved their jobs to canada and to mexico a trump administration will stop the jobs from leaving america believe me and we will stop the jobs from leaving new hampshire  the theft of american prosperity will end they have taken away our prosperity from now on its going to be america first  therell be consequences there will be consequences if a company wants to fire their workers leave new hampshire move another  you know to another country wonderful enjoy yourself right and then ship their products back into the united states they will pay a  percent tax ok  and let me just tell you a little  right now they move they build they have lots of fun and they just send it right through a very weak border first of all theyre gonna have to send through a very strong border but thats ok but theyre gonna have a  percent tax heres whats going to happen theyre not gonna move because it doesnt work anymore theyre not gonna move theyre gonna stay in this country theyre gonna stay in new hampshire theyre gonna stay in this country its so simple but the politicians will never approve that because the special interests and their donors want them to be able to go and  you know its  good for them but its not good for us a trump administration will renegotiate nafta and if we dont get the deal we want we will terminate nafta and get a much better deal for our workers we have to have jobs  you know i  i said before its a one  its a onelane highway we have to have a lane coming in our direction too folks we have nothing we get nothing we will also immediately stop the jobkilling transpacific partnership thats gonna be the next disaster  thats another beauty thatll take the jobs you have left as part of our plan to bring back jobs we are going to lower taxes on american business from  percent to  percent and well keep our business   were right now the highest taxed nation in the world and remember hillary wants to raise taxes big league we will massive cut taxes for the middle class she wants to raise them big league doesnt even make sense we will also  thats right  billion   billion   trillion not a  trillion youre right nobody can even believe it one point  go ahead   thats right he read the  he read her page and if she says that its going higher you know that  trillion can you  its inconceivable were the highest taxed nation in the world remember that we will also cancel  were gonna save ourselves altogether ok  he says save us were gonna all save ourselves this is a movement  ill tell you this is a movement like has never been before and you know id say it all the time and they dont even question it because the dishonest media among the worlds most dishonest people  they dont even question and now were gonna  were gonna  were gonna be so strong again and so smart again were gonna be  you dont have to worry about saving its gonna be well beyond saving ok we will also cancel billions in global warming payments to the united nations money that we dont even know what they do with it  we dont even know what they do with it and use that money to support americas environmental infrastructure for instance up here what we want we want crystal clear clean water right everybody we want beautiful  right we want beautiful air to breath we want safety other than that thats all we want the rest we want are companies to go out and compete with oil they cant compete because of all of these restrictions but we want clear water clean air and we want safety thats to me what i like and thats to me  and ive won many environmental awards by the way im  ive actually been called an environmentalist if you can believe that  that includes protecting the great bay and the white mountains of new hampshire were gonna protect them  theyll be protected theyll be better protected than they are right now with a lot less intrusive nonsense  our plan will end excessive federal regulations that are harming fisherman on the sea coast you know all about that theyre making it impossible theyre making it for the miners for the fishermen theyre making it impossible for the steel workers with all the dumping of steel all over the place we will become a rich nation again  a truly rich nation some people think that doesnt sound nice  its not politically correct we have to  but to be a rich nation we much also be a safe nation hillary clinton wants a  percent increase in syrian refugees flowing into our country  thats over and above the thousands and thousands being let in right now by obama her plan would mean generations of terrorism extremism and radicalism spreading into your schools and throughout your communities when im elected president we will suspend the syrian refugee program  and we will keep radical islamic terrorists the hell out of our country sorry  had no choice we have no choice and we all have a heart and will build safe zones in syria well help them we all have a heart but we see whats happening to germany and to france and to all of these  its a disaster its a disaster look at nice this summer look at whats going on in paris and all of these  all of these different places were gonna work but were  you know we owe  trillion were not gonna spend the money ill get the gulf states to put up the money they have tremendous money they need us they have to step up to the plate they need us well get them to put up the money well lead the effort and well build safe zones all over syria and well take care of it well get other people to pay well get other people to pay  who said that who that statement could only be made in new hampshire i have to tell you you people if the press hears that statement youll be in trouble but somehow i think hell be able to handle it a trump administration will also secure defend the borders of the united states  and yes we will build a great wall  we received the firstever endorsement from our ice and border patrol officers we will work with them  these are great people but the way wouldve been a lot easier if they didnt  look if hillary got in all theyd have to do is stand there and let people walk right in front of them  these are great people they know what is happening to our country they see whats happening to our country we will work with them to stop the drugs from pouring into new hampshire and throughout the country and poisoning our youth the immigration officers warned in a letter that hillarys plan is the most radical immigration proposal in us history and that will lead to the loss of thousands and thousands of lives its a quote from them as secretary of state hillary clinton allows many many people  she allowed so many people the most dangerous and violent criminal aliens to go free because their home countries  very intelligently  wouldnt take them back we get these people that werent supposed to be here that are violent criminals drug dealers gang members heads of gangs we put them in a plane we send them back their countries say we dont want them we dont want them were not taking them theyd call the secretary of state  or her or her people  they wont take them back thats ok bring them back let them out and then they kill people ok or they do other things that are very bad i promise you that when we deport some real bad ones there will never be a time when that plane  or whatever form of transportation they want to use  there will never be a time when that plane comes back with that person sitting in the   ever never never happen they dont respect us these other countries dont have respect hillary supports totally open borders there goes your country and strongly supports sanctuary cities like san francisco where kate steinle was murdered by an illegal immigrant deported at least five times a trump administration will cancel all federal funding to sanctuary cities  we will end illegal immigration stop the drugs from pouring into our country deport all criminal aliens and save so many american lives  we will also reap  and its just safe   its just  doesnt that make sense   we will also repeal the obamaclinton defense sequester and rebuild our badly depleted military  greatest people on earth  the greatest people our navy is the smallest its been listen to this how sad and then you see china in the south china sea building their fortresses and taking our money they take our money and they build their fortresses well have a great relationship i have a great relationship with china ive made a lot of money dealing with china chinas terrific look dealing with china is great but im  and im not angry china for doing this stuff im angry at our people for allowing it to happen our navy is the smallest it has been since world war i you believe that we will build the  ship navy that our country needs and really is requesting which means lots more work for the portsmouth naval shipyard  right great shipyard not too busy but its a great shipyard well make it busy and you know things like that  number one were building our defense it also puts our great people to work right its great well also expand the center of excellence at portsmouth to recruit a large number of skilled craftsmen like pipefitters and welders that we need to expand our fleet im honored to have the endorsement of more than  top admirals and generals and  medal of honor recipients i was with them last night  near fort bragg  we were right near fort bragg last night we had some amazing people we had over  people it was the most unbelievable evening and we had tremendous numbers of admirals and generals and we had a lot of medal of honor winners amazing it was an amazing evening our new foreign policy will put america first you havent heard that for a long time hillary brought death and disaster to iraq syria libya she empowered iran and she unleashed isis now she wants to start a shooting war in syria in conflict  and this in conflict with a nucleararmed russia that could seriously lead to world war iii i think shes an unstable person to start off with i really do  i think shes unstable   she and obama created it through the vacuum hillary   wars that never end wars that we never win and now its in worse shape than its ever been before and we have to rebuild our country folks we could have rebuilt our country twice and the middle east now is far worse than it was when we started this whole mess theyve dragged us into foreign wars that have made us less safe and theyve left our borders wide open at home isnt it interesting how we fight for other peoples borders lose our lives  the lives the money  most important are the lives the great lives we lose lives the money and yet we want to have open borders right explain that we fight for borders for other countries  half the people never heard of these other countries they want borders and then we leave our borders open and theyve shipped our jobs and theyve shipped our wealth to other countries to all americans i say it is time for new leadership  we need change we need change the last thing we need is four more years of obama with isis   thats really nice i think were going to have a great great day on tuesday in new hampshire  you know one of the big commentators political commentators  i thought id tell you its only good for your ego  but just said whoever wins new hampshire is going to win  its interesting right she said youll win by five only five i want more than five lets win  justin  concluded just think about what we can accomplish in the first  days of a trump administration  were going to have the biggest tax cut since ronald reagan and maybe beyond and hillary wants to raise your taxes were going to eliminate every unnecessary jobkilling regulation killing businesses we will cancel every illegal obama executive order  we are going to protect religious liberty  rebuild our military and take care of our great great vets were going to take care of our vets  and i mean really take care of them not like all the lip service theyve had for  years our vets  by the way folks are treated so poorly the stories are horrible stories  great  thats great  hold that up with pride we love you man we love you that is beautiful thank you  were going to take care of our vets were going to provide school choice and put an end to common core  were going to have education local we will support the great men and women of law enforcement  something which you folks like a lot we will save  we will save our very much under siege second amendment  and appoint justices to the united states supreme court who will  right who will uphold and defend the constitution of the united states  its time to cut our ties with the failed and bitter politics of the past hillary clinton is the candidate of yesterday we  you  you  we are the movement of the future  common sense intelligence our movement represents all americans from all backgrounds and all walks of life were asking for the votes of republicans and democrats and independents and first time voters  of which there are plenty you just have to look at the lines in florida north carolina and all over the place you look at whats happening tremendous numbers of people that havent voted in  years or first time voters were fighting  like him he just said like him  well thank you man he just said i voted is that your first time thats beautiful thank you  lot of people lot of people i mean you have people literally  and they show the lines in florida and texas remember they said texas is in play  two weeks ago i said really i thought i was doing great in texas these people theyre horrible people texas  they go texas is in play and then they have the lines theyre a mile long and then you have this wonderful guy mr miller  sid miller gets on one of the shows how are you doing in texas he says this is a total blowout for trump now theyre saying its in play so these lines are a mile long we never had lines like this and people that have never voted before are coming onto the lines wearing trump shirts and hats and buttons falling off that these are people that never voted these are people that didnt give a damn for politics because they never saw anybody that they liked they love the country as much as anybody but they never  like you  but they never saw anybody that they felt good about and they didnt vote and now they go from that they go from being a non political person into wearing trump shirts and buttons its a beautiful thing  its a beautiful thing  but texas is a total blowout but you remember right texas is in play  these characters theyre just bad people the media they are bad people bad people  and then one of them said this morning we were wrong about texas a total blowout were going to have a lot of blowouts i think   ill never forget it folks im telling you four five days ago before the lines formed texas is in play i said man that would be terrible i dont wanna lose texas that would be terrible total blowout we love the people of texas we are fighting for every citizen who believes that government should serve the people not the donors and not the special interests  were fighting to unlock the potential of every american community and every american family and hope and pray and yearn

107,"Trump","thank you everybody wow  this is amazing this is amazing unbelievable  thank you very much  thank you very much everybody this is amazing and you know what we have  people outside trying to get in can you believe this  in four days we are going to win the great state of pennsylvania  and we are going to win back the white house we are going to win it back unbelievable look at this maybe because i went to school in pennsylvania maybe thats the reason  maybe my kids went to school in pennsylvania a smart place pennsylvania real change begins with immediately repealing and replacing obamacare  its just been announced that the residents of pennsylvania are going to experience a massive doubledigit premium hike  no good in the great state of arizona where i just left premiums are going up more than  percent  all  counties in pennsylvania are losing obamacare insurers next year lots of luck negotiating folks but it wont matter because it will be terminated you wont have to bother well have great health care at much less expense  much lower price youll be paying a fraction of what youre paying and youre going to get really good stuff i can tell you premiums are surging on obamacare companies are leaving insurers are fleeing doctors are quitting and deductibles are through the roof you have deductibles     nobody has ever seen anything so ridiculous and yet hillary clinton wants to double down on obamacare making it even more expensive  and she also wants to by the way raise your taxes very substantially i am asking for your vote so we can repeal and replace obamacare and save health care for every family in pennsylvania and our country were going to do it folks were going to do it oh boy are we going to win  we are going to win pennsylvania big look at this  i hear we set a new record for this building and by the way i didnt have to bring jlo or jay z the only way she gets anybody  im here all by myself i am here all by myself just me no guitar no piano no nothing  but you know what we do have and its all of us its all the same we all have great ideas and great vision for our country thats what we have  so i know we have two of our great congressman here tom marino lou barletta theyre here where are they  no we love them folks theyre great real change also means restoring honesty to our government as you know the fbi  and you know this  has anybody heard has anybody heard  just a little rumor just a little rumor i think a couple of you have heard as you know  the fbi has reopened its criminal investigation into hillary clinton  they are also conducting a second criminal investigation into hillarys payforplay corruption at the state department  last night it was just confirmed that the   can you believe that number  emails they discovered include brandnew emails not previously seen by authorities likely they will be classified information loaded however the reports also show that the political leadership at the department of justice is trying very hard actually as hard as they can to protect hillary clinton from the fbi  from the fbi  and i salute the fbi for taking the step  remember john podesta  her top person  said hillary clinton has bad instincts  wikileaks bernie sanders said she has bad judgment so if shes got bad instincts i mean if shes got bad judgment why are we putting her to run for president right i mean why is she running bad instincts you know sanders was running against her so he says bad judgment  works with her all the time and he puts in an email that hillary has bad instincts thats not who we want for president folks and then you have president obama instead of getting jobs instead of taking care of our military  instead of beating isis he is out campaigning all the time he ought to go back to the oval office and go to work  she created an illegal email server to shield her criminal activity and then she illegally destroyed  emails after receiving a congressional subpoena the key word is after so she gets the subpoena  congressional subpoena you dont get any better than that and she said you better get rid of these well she said it was about the wedding and about yoga remember thirtythree thousand but i have a feeling the  will do very nicely if she were to win it would create an unprecedented constitutional crisis this will go on for years folks if she ever got into the oval office hillary and her special interests would rob our country blind  my contract with the american voter begins with a plan to end government corruption  i want the entire corrupt washington establishment to hear the words we are all about to say when we win on november th we are going to drain the swamp  i keep telling people i hated that expression i said its so hokey and then one group heard it they went crazy another group heard it then we had a big big rally in florida they went crazy about it and now i love it its true its very accurate at the core of my contract is my plan to bring back our jobs  the great state of pennsylvania has lost almost  percent of its manufacturing jobs since nafta a deal signed by bill clinton and supported by crooked hillary clinton one of the most amazing statistics that ive ever heard something i thought was a typographical error america has lost not  not  which i assumed it might be has lost  factories since china entered the world trade organization another bill clinton and hillary backed deal  we are living through the greatest job theft in the history of the world tyco laid off  workers in harrisburg and carlisle and moved their jobs to china india and mexico  ge connectivity laid off  workers in middletown and moved their jobs to china vietnam and singapore  codai  laid off  workers moved their jobs to china durabond pipe laid off  workers and moved their jobs overseas a trump administration will stop the jobs from leaving america and we will stop the jobs from leaving pennsylvania  the theft of american prosperity will end its ending if a company wants to fire their workers leave pennsylvania move to another country like mexico which is taking so many of our companies and the ship their products back into the united states where we will soon have by the way a very strong and powerful border  we will make them pay a  percent tax on those products coming in  now you know whats going to happen right theyre not leaving they wont leave and if they do were going to make a lot of money theyre going to pay a lot of tax but they wont leave they wont leave a trump administration will renegotiate nafta and if we dont get the deal we want we will terminate nafta and get a much much much better deal for our workers  we will also immediately stop the job killing transpacific partnership another disaster in the making as part of her plan to bring back jobs we are going to lower taxes on american businesses from  percent to  percent  we will massively cut taxes for the middle class most importantly  and by the way hillary clinton is going to raise taxes very substantially  you saw that during the debate by the way who won the debates who won the debates  you know she kept saying she is working on debate prep for weeks oh shes always working on debate prep you know if youre doing this stuff for  years why does she need so much debate prep like a week and a half before the debate she was at her home why isnt she leaving she is working on debate prep i felt guilty i mean how much you have to learn right that was just an excuse to rest and go to sleep ok believe me by the way two friends of mine  and have to tell you  they are  i dont even know where they are this is a hard one to find ill tell you why you know a great great couple barbara and hugh rone do you know about their son riley riley rone where are they are they around here someplace where are they come up here if you can do you mind do you mind  come on tell the secret service believe me theyre ok to come up right that would be the surprise of all time these are incredible people their son recently passed away in a horrible accident he was the biggest supporter i had young guy beautiful guy the most popular person there was and he was just very special and i want to introduce  and if youd like to say a few words  riley riley was their son as much as some of you like trump i like you more than you like me if you want to know the truth this boy was our biggest fan he loved our country believe me he loved our country say a few words about our boy ok   they know him   she does a good job doesnt she   wow oh boy i didnt expect that so well dedicate this evening to riley ok  boy that takes courage hard to go back to the economy after that right thank you very much that was so beautiful thank you thank you thank you we will unleash american energy including shale oil natural gas and clean coal  we will put our miners back to work we will put our steel workers back to work  you know whats happened to your state with respect to miners and steelworkers and hillary wants to do the opposite were going to put them back to work theyre going to be happier than ever before and my infrastructure plan will provide help for projects like  did you ever hear of a place called the pennsylvania turnpike  needs some help needs some work we spend all these trillions all over the place we cant fix our potholes in the pennsylvania turnpike or anywhere else our country is going to hell unbelievable you look at our infrastructure of this country we will also rebuild our inner cities they are so bad the africanamerican community the hispanic community people living in the inner cities have been treated so unfairly they have been run for  sometimes more than  years unbroken by democrats and people with the wrong ideas theyre unsafe you can go shot walking to the store for a loaf of red theyre unsafe they have the worst education they have no jobs  no jobs you look at unemployment rate of africanamerican youth you look at it its  percent   percent and i say give me a chance i will fix it i actually go what the hell do you have to lose believe me i will fix it  we will all fix it together it will be a great thing we have to fix it we have to fix it were going to fix it were going to fix the inner cities we will become a rich nation once again but to be a rich nation we must also be a safe nation hillary clinton wants a  percent increase in syrian refugees  and thats over and above the thousands and thousands and thousands that are right now pouring into our country under obama her plan will import generations of terrorism extremism and radicalism into your schools and throughout your communities you know whats happened when im elected president we will suspend the syrian refugee program  and we will keep radical islamic terrorists the hell out of our country  you know just in standing and watching and looking at this incredible spirit right up to the tiny corners of the room  with thousands and thousands of people standing outside watching big screens anybody want to switch places with them  i say isnt it sad that the most dishonest people there are  the media  dont spin the cameras and show them this crowd  isnt it sad they never show the crowd they never show the crowds today obama had a protester and the protester  if i have one they immediately pick out the protester even though the protesters we just found out through wikileaks were paid  to go into our rallies and be violent right  and in chicago they badly hurt policemen they badly hurt other people although our people can take care of themselves very nicely  but whenever theres a protester the only time those cameras move the only time they pick out a protester because thats a negative thing right and yet obama today spoke in front of a much smaller crowd than this by the way and there was a protester and a protester that likes us and what happened is they wouldnt put the cameras on them they kept the cameras on obama and i said thats strange you saw it today on television right he was talking to the protester screaming at him really screaming at him by the way if i spoke the way obama spoke to that protester they would say he became on his he   you have to go back and look and study and see what happened they never moved the camera and he spent so much time screaming at this protester and frankly it was a disgrace it was  and he shouldnt be there and he shouldnt be there to start off with  but id love to see them spin the cameras id love to see them go outside and see  i mean this arena is massive but id love to see them go outside and see the thousands and thousands of people  that are outside look at the cameras they dont move folks they dont move they dont move theyre right here  they dont move they dont want to show it folks they dont want to show it but theyre not happy they see the polls were leading in ohio  were leading in iowa were leading in north carolina  were leading in new hampshire were leading in florida  and i actually think were leading in the great state of pennsylvania  i love you people but they wont show watch you go home you wont see the crowds they wont  they wont talk about them you got to see hillary show have like   people  what a joke what dishonesty a trump administration will also secure and defend the borders of the united states and yes  and yes we will build a great wall  build a great wall  who is going to pay for the wall  one hundred percent they dont know it but theyre paying honestly they do know it they do know it and thats all right i met two months ago with the president of mexico good guy well work things out well have better relationships with mexico well have better relationships with china look at china we have a trade deficit with china of almost  billion a year think of it china think of it and yet they taunt us with building a massive fortress right smack in the middle of the south china sea theyre not supposed to be doing it we have no relationship with china and yet they rip us ive had a great relationship with china the largest bank in the world is a tenant of mine in manhattan so many other things were going to have a great relationship with china and im not angry at china im angry at our leaders for allowing so many different countries to rip is off  thats who im angry with all right that will end does anybody have any doubt that thats  and we will have  honestly were going to have a better relationship with most of these countries the reason is they dont respect us they dont respect obama hes like a cheerleader hes jumping up and down all over the place for hillary he shouldnt be doing that he shouldnt be with her hes got to be working you know what were better off if he doesnt work hell only make bad deals well have to unscramble  were better off we received the first ever endorsement from our ice and border patrol officers  first time theyve ever endorsed a candidate its just been reported that as a result of our open borders violent cartels have spread into all  of our states more than  of those arrested are here illegally  thank you very much they are killing innocent  threatening schools and totally destroying communities a government that will not protect its people is a government that is unworthy to lead as secretary of state hillary clinton allowed thousands and thousands of the most dangerous and violent criminals to go free because their home countries wouldnt take them back they bring them to their countries and very intelligently these countries would say we dont want the murderers drug kings the gang members so theyd bring them in and the countries would say were not taking them back bring them back to your country and she was head of state department and she said bring them back we dont want to  believe me i promise you this never once  never once will we be bringing anybody back never once never once  and if they come back into our country one year in jail and if they come back a second time into our country five years in jail and then  years in jail and they wont be coming back theyre not going to be coming very few believe me when they know that you know what we do we capture them over and over and over and we let them go there have to be consequences folks there have to be consequences hillary supports totally open borders  there goes your country  and strongly supports sanctuary cities like san francisco  where kate steinle was murdered by an illegal immigrant and this immigrant this illegal immigrant was deported at least five times not going to happen anymore folks thousands of americans would be alive today if not for the open border policies of obama and clinton this includes americans like josh wilkerson whose mother ive gotten to know during the campaign josh was a student in a high school good student good kids everybody loved him whos murdered at the age of  he was tortured strangled beaten to death by the illegal immigrant and then his body was set on fire everybody wanted this guy out they wanted him incarcerated in july right here in pennsylvania an illegal immigrant with a previous deportation record horrible record raped a young child the illegal immigrant had been arrested for aggravated assault on numerous occasions but he was set free he was set free everybody that knew him said please please dont set him free he was set free by weak ineffective policy  by weak ineffective leadership a trump administration will end this vast nightmare of violence were talking about thousands and thousands of incidents we will protect american lives  we will cancel all federal funding to sanctuary cities  we will stop illegal immigration deport criminal aliens and dismantle every last criminal cartel thats in this country  and by the way our local police who are so incredible they know every one of these people they know everyone they have to put with them every day when we win you will finally have a government on your side fighting for your community and protecting your family  we will also repeal the obamaclinton defense sequester and rebuild our badly depleted military we have no choice  that means new resources for the nearby army war college that will train the next generation of army leaders now mosul i talk about mosul because i cant believe it first of all we have mosul it was the way we got out whether you wanted to be in iraq you should have been in iraq but we had mosul it was all done but then clinton and obama did that crazy  get out they got out the wrong way so they took mosul back now four months ago i start hearing were going to take mosul were going to take  and i say whatever happened to the element of surprise right so we had mosul but we essentially gave it up now were going to take it by the way just so you understand ive never even said this before who benefits by us getting mosul you know its going to benefit iran were not going to benefit because iran is taking over iraq we handed that to them along with one of the dumbest deals ive ever seen the  billion back  the  billion in cash that we gave these people a terrorist  number one terrorist nation   billion in cash and now they feel emboldened and they go and they harass our ships and they take our  sailors and humiliate the sailors humiliate our country its not going to happen well he said never happen with you i promise it will never happen with me i promise you that  i promise you that but just to finish because we see the army college just to finish so mosul we want to go into mosul just four months ago because we want to get isis leaders we think theyre in mosul well if you want to get them you dont talk about it right you dont talk about it you go get them and have the news conference later wouldnt that be nice  i always say what ever happened to the element of surprise so four months ago i heard it then three months then two months in the meantime you know theyre buried in there they are using human shields we have no choice but to take isis out we have to because theyre chopping off heads theyre doing things when you read the history books not since medieval times has anything like this happen and it formed during this period of time of hillary clinton now hillary is saying we will get isis what the hell did she let it start for  now isis is in  countries all around the world and what a shame it is we have people in leadership that are grossly incompetent were going to change it were going to change it fast ok  im honored to have the endorsement of more than  top admirals and generals and  medal of honor recipients you saw that last night right near fort bragg  great place great people we had  people last night we had more people last night than i have tonight although if you include the people outside we may have them  we may have them im not sure i think if you include outside we may have more than that hillary clinton brought death and disaster to iraq syria libya and she empowered iran and she unleashed isis all across the world hillary and our failed establishment have spent  trillion on wars in the middle east that we dont win and now the middle east is in far worst shape and far more dangerous than it ever was before they dragged us into foreign wars that makes us less safe shipped our jobs and wealth to other countries and they had left our borders wide open at home we go into wars and we set strong borders but at home we have no borders we send our troops to foreign countries to defend their borders but our politicians refuse to defend our borders that will change on november th believe me  that will change november th that will be a big day a trump administration will never ever put the interest of a foreign country before the interest of our country ever  to the people of pennsylvania to all of the people in the united states i say from now on its going to be america first   to all americans i say it is time for change and time for new leadership we need it  we just cannot have four more years of obama because thats what were getting if we do this its four more years its isis running rampant its no borders its bad jobs you see the jobs reports theyre horrible you saw what happened just two days ago the jobs report is a disaster and theyre all bad jobs because our good jobs are disappearing its  its no good folks four more years we cant have it can you imagine  can you imagine i saw these great men these great admirals last night these great generals these are great people strong smart i saw these unbelievably brave recipients of the medal of honor and i said to them how would you feel to have hillary clinton as your leader and theyre  theyre wonderful americans  and i refuse to tell you what they said but it wasnt good believe me can you imagine these people taking orders these great people taking orders from her  bad judgment remember just think about what we can accomplish in the first  days of a trump administration we are going to have the biggest tax cut since ronald reagan and maybe bigger and hillary is going to raise that  were going to eliminate every unnecessary jobkilling regulation we will cancel every illegal obama executive order  protect religious liberty  that  that  its time rebuild our military and take care of our great great veterans our great people  theyve been horribly horribly taken care of provide school choice and put an end to common core were bringing our education local  support the incredible men and women of law enforcement  and today in new york city two policemen were  as you know were horribly shot it goes on and on and on were going to save our second amendment which is totally under siege  and appoint justices to the united states supreme court who will uphold and defend the constitution of the united states so important its time to cut our ties with the failed politicians of the past hillary clinton is the candidate of yesterday we are the movement of the future  we are the movement of the future this is a great movement this is a movement thats never happened before ever in the history of our country ever in the history theres never been anything like it and i will say  and i understand how the system works i understand the system i guess as well as anybody understands i was on the other side i was enjoying it very much i also love our country and it can no longer work that way its not fair it can no longer work we wont have a country and boy oh boy so i went from being an insider did i ever become an outsider wow i became a serious outsider  but were all outsiders and thats the way we like it were all outsiders but its a movement like its never been seen before and even of the dishonest people back there and the pundits they say  some of them say its the single greatest political phenomena that theyve ever seen in this country  and it is and thats why we cannot do anything thats going to stop it we have to get out pennsylvania you are so important everyone talks pennsylvania if you win pennsylvania youre going to win pennsylvania  now were doing great all over the state and i really believe im going to do well in philadelphia because thats where i went to school specifically i love philadelphia dont

america strong again  we will make america safe again we will make america great again thank you god bless you everybody go out and vote thank you"
108,"Trump","what a place have you been seeing whats happening with those polls theyre like rocket ships theyre like rocket ships  i tell you its been great i love ohio i love ohio  i worked in ohio did well in ohio gave me confidence to go out with life right at the beginning i was in ohio so we love it thank you everyone for coming in four days we are going to win the great state of ohio and we are going to win back the white house new polls just out have us with a very substantially lead in ohio nationwide many of the states were looking great in florida were looking great in north carolina we are looking great in the state of pennsylvania we just left new hampshire we have a lead in new hampshire these very dishonest people back there the media theyre getting a little worried theyre getting a little bit worried this wasnt supposed to happen this was not supposed to happen you can vote early in person or you can show up on november th who has voted whoa not great but youre saving it for november th i think correct you want to be traditional right real change begins with immediately repealing and replacing horrible obamacare its just been announced that the residents of ohio are going to experience massive massive problems with their obamacare you know about that i guess right you know about it its a serious problem it is a serious problem and youre going to have numbers in the great state of arizona its gone up  percent okay  percent so youre going to have a lot of problems were going to work on it very hard  counties in ohio are losing at least three obamacare insurers a year okay so next year youre going to have almost almost nobody even to negotiate with by next year but its not going to matter because if we win the election youre not going to have obamacare to worry about youre not going to have obamacare nothing to worry about believe me and we are going to have great healthcare at a much lower price and its going to be something youre going to be very proud of right now its an international joke obamacare its an international joke  premiums are surging companies are leaving insurers are fleeing doctors are quitting i know so many doctors theyve quit and generally speaking deductibles are going through the roof some higher than others we have deductibles ive heard as high as  or  yet hillary clinton wants to double down on obamacare making it even more expensive im asking for your vote so we can replace obamacare and save healthcare for every family in ohio but more importantly because we dont want to think of ourselves for every family in the united states  its a big problem it is a big problem real change also means restoring honesty to government so we ought to start by getting rid of hillary clinton the fbi now has multiple open criminal investigations going on hillary clinton lots of bad things are happening lots of really bad things are happening but ill tell you what youre going to be amazed when its all finished when you look at how its all fleshing out the system is a beautiful system when it works we have a rigged system so many times you see this i mean you have things going on that are incredible that includes a discovery of another  emails and also a criminal investigation into her pay for play corruption at the state department amazing last night it was just confirmed that the  emails include brand new emails not previously seen by authorities likely including classified information hillary is now facing major problems with perjury the fbi agents say their investigation is likely to yield perhaps an indictment i love them i love them the reports also show that the political leadership at the department of justice is trying as hard as they can to protect their angel hillary this is no angel they want to protect their angel did we ever have a situation like this seriously  first of all forget about as of last friday with the new  emails that was found forget that she should have been disqualified for running for president from the first batch of emails and from all of the crimes that have been committed i mean take a look at the first batch why do we even have to go now were doing it oh look what we found how many times do we have to do this i believe the fbi wanted to do it and she was protected by friends of hers at the department of justice thats the department where as you know the attorney the general was on the airplane now they say it was for  minutes talking about the grandchildren and talking about golf for  minutes i dont think so i think they were talking about a position in other words a continuation of a position i think thats what they were talking about folks hillary has engaged in a criminal massive enterprise and cover ups like probably nobody ever before remember john podesta said she has bad instincts and as you know as i was getting off the plane they were just announcing new wikileaks and i wanted to stay there but i didnt want to keep you waiting i didnt want to keep you waiting let me run back into the plane and find out i didnt want to go  oh there were some beauties coming out and im saying do i listen for another  you know you can listen for hours but think of it john podesta her top person said she has bad instincts who the hell wants a president where the person that knows her best said her instincts are bad now bernie sanders said she has bad judgment but at least he was running against her right but the person working with  i tell you what i would fire podesta very quickly if i were hillary he should be fired and honestly shouldnt huma be fired huma i mean can you imagine did you get rid of all the emails yes maam theyre all gone yes maam this has gone now for months did you get rid of the emails yes maam theyre gone we deleted  of them theyre all gone i think were in the clear and then they find out going through a perverts file anthony weiner anybody in new york knows all about anthony weiner and i predicted it a year ago did you hear me right and i said all the things i said and they all said what a horrible thing to say i turned out to be right and even some of these very dishonest people in the media said trump really called that one i called a lot of them i called a lot of them but can you imagine huma  i got rid of them theyre all gone thirty thousand didnt i do a good job and then they find out uhoh we got bad news boss i think they went on the cloud you know the cloud never disappears off the cloud so those people when they advertise the cloud never disappears she said boss we have bad news for you they just found  emails can you imagine and ill tell you some of those emails all  i would bet anything some of those emails are so bad theyre so classified theyre beyond classified they have emails there that are beyond classified and its all coming down because ive always had a lot of confidence in the fbi i tell you we have amazing people in the fbi and theyre not happy theyre not happy about whats happening and theyre not happy about the way theyre being pushed around and you dont push them around for long believe me  she created an illegal email server to shield her criminal activity and corrupt pay for play and then she illegally destroyed  emails after  this the big key after thats the key word after receiving a congressional subpoena so after so she gets the subpoena and she says get rid of it and thats fine and yet they put a four star general last week james cartwright highly respectable current four star general they may put him in jail for up to five years for doing nothing by comparison general petraeus suffered horribly reputation destroyed for doing nothing by comparison they took the kid who wanted some pictures of the submarine thats an old submarine theyve got plenty of pictures if the enemy wants them theyve got plenty of them he wanted to take a couple of pictures they put him in jail for a year i saw his mother the other night on television i tell you what folks weve never been in a situation like this and if shes allowed to run for president then general cartwright should put in jail for doing peanuts and he said he did it  and he said he did it for  he said that he lied for national security purposes who knows but he did nothing by comparison to what shes done if she were to win it would create an unprecedented constitutional crisis she is likely to be under investigation for a long time concluding probably in a criminal trial hey look we all want to go through a process and we want to make sure everyone is guilty properly guilty properly everything has to be perfect but she did things where  and we have a trial have to go with but shes guilty shes guilty she took the emails and thats the least of what she did she got rid of emails thats the least of what she did if she ever got into the oval office hillary and her corrupt friends would rob this country blind my contract with the american voter begins with a plan to end government corruption i want the entire corrupt washington establishment to hear and heed the words we all are about to say we all  are you ready isnt it amazing how this phrase has gone up i didnt like it i thought it was corny i dont know where they really sort of a corny phrase i didnt like it when we win in november th we are going to washington dc and we are going to drain the swamp i thought it was corny and then i went to one rally and another and theyre all screaming drain the swamp but frank sinatra didnt like my way he didnt like until he sang it the audience went crazy sang it again became number one all of a sudden he loved it very much  at the core of my contract is my plan to bring back our jobs ohio has lost one in four of its manufacturing jobs since nafta deal signed by bill clinton and supported by crooked hillary clinton america has lost  this is one of the hardest things to believe because it doesnt seem physically possible seventy thousand factories since china entered the world trade organization another bill and hillarybacked disaster were living through the greatest jobs theft in the history of the world its true its the single greatest jobs theft you take a look at whats happened not only in ohio you look at upstate new york you look at pennsylvania you look at north carolina you look at south carolina you look at whats going on look at new england boy they got hit general motors lay off  workers in moraine and moved their jobs to mexico china and various other countries faurecia laid off  workers in troy anybody from troy good do you still have your job and moved their jobs to mexico delphi laid off  whats with delphi you know about that right five thousand eight hundred and five workers in dayton boy oh boy thats a lot of jobs and moved their jobs to mexico we have a oneway highway going into some of these countries especially mexico everything goes in i always say they get the jobs the plants the money we get the drugs we get the unemployment its a one way street not going to happen anymore folks its not going to happen anymore  there have to be consequences when that happens theres going to be consequences were going to fight  oh dont worry about it well build the wall its going to be a great wall too its going to be a great wall and every time i see a delphi and every time i see these companies leaving that wall gets a little bit higher its going up its going to be a great wall were going to fight for workers and were going to fight so delphi and these other companies dont leave us and theres going to be consequences because the people got a raw deal and they deserve so much better  a trump administration will stop the jobs from leaving ohio and from leaving america and well stop the jobs ill tell you what like youve never seen before it will happen quickly the theft of american prosperity will end if a company wants to fire their workers leave ohio move to another country build their big beautiful factory ship their products back into the united states we will make them pay a  percent tax going through a very strong wall its going to be a very strong wall  and you know whats going to happen theyre not going to leave not going to leave now the politicians could do something about this how long have we been talking about this  years right it got really bad over the last five or six years really bad its gotten to be catastrophic catastrophic but they know this i mean some do and some dont some are not exactly  i wont say it some arent too bright some arent too bright and some are getting tremendous amounts of money from donors and from people that want to see those companies leave they have reasons for the companies to leave including ownership interest in those companies the problem is the politicians are working for those donors theyre not working for the american people theyre not working for all the people that got fired from what were good jobs so whats going to happen is they want to leave and the ones who do leave thats okay too because the country will make a fortune because thats going to be called a consequence we can stop it dead and as we see speak right now you have leaders in your company going out right now as were speaking you have leaders going out trying to negotiate deals to leave ohio and other places go to mexico go to another countries but dont worry about it because if i get elected therell be very little negotiation a trump administration will renegotiate nafta and if we dont get the deal we want we will terminate nafta and get a much better deal for our workers i want free trade i want fair trade you know everyone wants free trade we keep calling it free trade well i want free trade too but i really want fair trade fair for this country and for our workers thats what its going to be were going to have fair fair trade  we will also immediately stop this job killing transpacific partnership from happening thats going to be thats another nafta potentially as part of our plan to bring back jobs were going to lower taxes on american business from  percent to  percent we will massively cut taxes for the middle class we will also unleash american energy including shale oil natural gas and clean coal were going to put our miners back to work were going to put our steel workers back to work  we will cancel billions of dollars of global warming payments to the united nations by the way nobody even knows what happens to that money i could tell you i have some pretty good ideas but nobody even knows what happens and we will use that money to invest in america that includes projects like improving interstate  does anybody like that idea you got to like it a lot otherwise lets save the money you know we owe  trillion okay if you like the idea of improving the interstate i mean its not exactly  youre not thrilled by it lets not do it then lets save the money and replacing the brent spence bridge in cincinnati you like that which is critical to the region you like that one better you know we should do that before we do a project have a big rally how do you like doing the interstate people go ahhh how do you like doing the bridge oh we love it its not a bad way actually we will also rebuild our inner cities we will become a rich nation once again you know our inner cities are in terrible shape the africanamerican community has been absolutely mistreated by the people running the inner cities for so many years up to a hundred years unbroken and were going to fix and invest in our inner cities were going to bring our jobs back into the inner cities the crime is unbelievable its staggering the crime thousands and thousands of shootings in chicago just since the beginning of the year were going to fix our inner cities jobs back good education and safety and i say to the africanamerican community i say to the hispanic community and ive said it what the hell do you have to lose i mean what have you got to lose were going to make our inner cities wonderful places safe good education and jobs and you know the democrats for years theyve taken advantage we want your vote we want your vote we want your vote  you give them the vote and then theyll say so long folks see you in four years thats what happened i will fix your inner cities and youd be so proud of them youre going to be so proud of them to be a rich country we must also be a safe country murder rates have experienced the largest single increase in  years now the dishonest media has attend to that they dont want you to know that firearmrelated deaths to police officers are up  percent just now just a couple of hours ago two new york city police officers supposed to be two great people were shot in the bronx badly badly shot we send our thoughts and prayers to the officers and their families just happened moments before i left the plane unbelievable a trump administration will protect those who protect us and we will stop this tremendous surge in murder we will also keep america safe from terrorism hillary clinton wants a  percent increase in syrian refugees flowing into our country thats above the thousands that are coming in now under the obama plan  percent above the thousands already coming in her plan will import generations of terrorism extremism and radicalism and its something we cant allow to happen theyll be in our schools theyll be in our communities and honestly we want to take care of people and we have to and well help them well build safe havens well get the gulf states who have nothing but money and they havent done their job they will pay for it were not paying for it we have  trillion were not paying for it when im elected president so we will take care of it we want  everybody here wants to take care of it but we dont want to end up like france you see whats happening in paris and nice you see whats happening in germany the problems  we have enough problems in our country we will suspend the syrian refugee program and we will keep radical islamic terrorists the hell of our country  and we have a president  by the way all he does is campaign shouldnt he back like trying to get jobs and working on isis and maybe not giving a four month notice that were going into mosul to attack them you saw that whole situation we will be attacking mosul in four months i say why dont tell that i dont want to hear that because we are going to capture the leaders of isis by attacking mosul you see whats going on right i say it all the time and every military leaders general flynn who is great general kellogg theyre all saying youre so right and were going to attack so we have a president frankly doesnt know what the hell hes doing he doesnt what look at whats happening with so many things whether its jobs but why is he spending all his time campaigning for somebody under federal investigation all he does is campaign and campaign he ought to be back in the oval office he ought to be back there working he ought to be back there working  now i have a lot of good suggestions out there with that so were going to make our country strong again were going to build up our military which is still badly depleted so badly depleted you know these are the greatest people there are and we have old equipment we have old fighter jets we have old planes and guns and everything the enemy has newer and better equipment than we do in many cases recently they had a documentary on the jets theyre   years old you saw it a lot of the people saw it where they cant replace the parts they cant replace the parts they have to go to plane graveyards and plane museums because theyre dont make the parts anymore so all of these things are happening we are going to have a topnotch modern military we dont have a choice we dont have a choice  we are going to do something else how many vets are in the audience wow thats a lot of vets we are going to take care of our vets and were going to take care of them properly we have illegal immigrants coming into the country that are taken better care of than our vets and thats not going to happen thats not going to happen our vets are waiting on line for five days six days seven days ten days to see a doctor for a simple procedure or a simple prescription its not going to happen anymore its not going to happen  you know that and this is a number two numbers are the hardest to believe that we lost  factories that i told you about  i thought they meant  factories or   the other one is that we have a suicide rate of  vets a day i said that cant be right you mean  a year no  a day and a lot of that is because of the horrible horrible situation thats taking place run by the veterans administration and this has been going on for years and hillary clinton said its fine its just fine the way it is you know that she says its just fine the way it is and thats i think during the debates it was very interesting and i did win the debates in all fairness did you see where she said all the time im in debate prep hillary clinton is debating i mean shes in debate prep she is in debate prep she was in there for weeks you know what is was it was really an excuse for her to go sleep and rest she was in debate prep and i kept hearing and i felt guilty shed slept like a week and half before and she was in debate prep she wasnt in debate prep and the truth is if you dont know the subjects so well that you have to prep for two weeks youre the wrong person anyway but it was really an excuse for her to sleep and to rest okay but we did well so we did win the debates right every poll every single poll said we won the debates  but i learned something in the debates because shes saying we will fight isis we will do this we will do that we dont like what you did with taxes donald trump i said well thats okay why didnt you change the tax code by the way all of her friends do the same thing its all rightm but why dont you change the tax code you were there you were a senator the secretary of state youre with  i mean you were the wife of a president she doesnt like it you know so like what shes like a critic she complains but shell never do anything about it she said well get rid of isis well there was no isis when she became the secretary of state isis formed during her tenure right it came out of the backend because the way they got out of iraq was unbelievably stupid and isis formed now theyre in  countries she has zero chance of getting rid of isis i have  percent chance  percent chance  we have no choice this is like were living in medieval times this isnt like its war and people get shot and people get killed and its horrible this is peoples heads are chopped off by the hundreds and by the thousands and if youre a christian you have no chance and its very hard you know if youre in syria ive heard this for years  even before the migration if youre a christian it was almost impossible to come into the united states almost impossible and yet these people were under this horrible horrible rule and they were being decimated and killed and by the way the evangelicals christians jews catholics i have such tremendous support its unbelievable its unbelievable so were going to do things that are going to make you very proud were going to be strong again a trump administration will also secure and defend the borders of the united states and as i have said when these young attractive people started screaming they want the wall we will build a wall that will make you so happy for that group over there a lot of youth here were going to build a great wall and mexico is going to pay for the wall  and the reason  were going to have a great relation  i was with the mexican president a short while ago very nice we had a great meeting but mexico is beating us at the border they are killing us on trade we have a trade deficit with mexico that nobody would believe its a fraction of what were talking about with respect to the cost of the wall because a lot of politicians ask me the question how are you going to get mexico to pay i said well when you see the trade deficit billions and billions of dollars and if you look at the cost of the wall then you will understand how easy its going to be so were going to build a wall and its going to be a great wall and mexico is going to pay for the wall were going to stop those drugs from pouring in and poisoning our youth we are going to stop it and it will be a great wall maybe someday theyll name it after trump who the hell knows  i really dont want it on the wall but thats we received the first ever endorsement from our ice and border control officers its just a report that as a result of our open borders violent transnational cartels have spread into all  of our states youve read that more than  percent of those arrested are here illegally so  percent of the people that are here doing the things that you and i know theyre doing are in our country illegally theyre killing innocent americans and others threatening schools and totally destroying communities a government that will not protect its people is a government unworthy to lead unworthy to lead and when you think of it  think of it with respect to radical islam where you have a president that wont mention the words and you have a candidate that wouldnt say radical islamic terrorism how can you solve the problem if you refuse to acknowledge it hillary will never protect your family which is why she can never lead this country but thats only one reason why the other reason why is that shes guilty of so many crimes and thats why its a rigged system because she should not be allowed to run and when you look at whats going with her protection youll understand exactly what im saying when i say rigged system you can ask bernie sanders about a rigged system the mistake he made  when he endorsed hillary clinton he made a deal with the devil and his stock went way down and we are going to get a lot of the bernie sanders people supporting us because he was right about one thing he was right about the borders and trade and you know what im much tougher on trade than he was ever ever a lot of his people are coming forward shouldve never made a deal  yes he would have gone down as a great presidential in political history had he not made that deal and now he just goes out and speaks before small crowds and then you see wikileaks all the bad things they say about him that alone should just stop him that alone should stop and just like i said thats why hillary should fire podesta  how do have people working that say these horrible things about you boy i love reading those wikileaks the immigration officers warned in their letter when they endorsed me that hillarys plan is the most radical immigration proposal in united states history it would lead to the loss of thousands and thousands of lives and they know what theyre talking about folks as secretary of state hillary clinton allowed many many many people the most dangerous and violent criminal aliens to go free because their home countries refused to take them back now i dont blame their home countries but when we catch drug lords killers gang members and we bring them back to their home country i give you my word there wont be one instance where that country doesnt take those people and we are going to have a plan because they keep coming back and back and back and back because were weak and were ineffective when they come back five years in jail when they come back again more than five years in jail and when they come back a third time much longer than that  let me tell you folks theyre never coming back its a very simple solution theyre never coming back they come back  times  times they look at us and they laugh  hillary supports totally open borders there goes your country and strongly supports sanctuary cities like san francisco where kate steinle was murdered by an illegal immigrant deported at least five times here in ohio yearold margaret kostelnik  was murdered in cold blood by an illegal immigrant last july in nearby concord township earlier that day her illegal immigrant killer attempted to rape a yearold girl and shot another woman while she was with her children in the park police had encountered the illegal immigrant more than three weeks before the crime spree but federal authorities refused to take him in just refused take him into custody he was set free and then he went out and killed margaret and people that knew him by the way were begging begging that hed be incarcerated but our weak immigration policies are responsible for many many deaths many deaths a trump administration will end this nightmare of violence we will protect american lives we will cancel all federal funding for sanctuary cities we will stop illegal immigration deport all criminal aliens and dismantle every last criminal cartel and it will happen within the first weeks of my presidency  when we win you will finally have a government on your side fighting for your community and protecting your family we will also repeal the obama clinton defense sequester and rebuild our so badly depleted military we will build new advanced aircraft at places like wrightpatterson air force base you like that one i like it too okay  im honored to have the endorsement of more than  top admirals and generals and more than  medal of honor recipients they were with me last night we were in fort bragg that was an amazing evening we had  people last night the most incredible brave people youve ever seen  hillary brought death and disaster to iraq syria libya she empowered iran and she unleashed isis across the world thats what she did through incompetence through gross incompetence she and obama unleashed isis now she wants to start a shooting war in syria in conflict with a nuclear armed russia that could easily lead to world war iii shes an unstable person folks i know my people shes an unstable person look at the way she handled this email mess do you want that handling our country hillary and our failed establishment have spent listen to this one this is the number  trillion in the middle east that we never win that go on forever we never win i wonder what general macarthur would say i wonder what general george patton who is spinning theyre spinning in their graves theyve made us less safe theyve shipped our jobs and our wealth to other countries and theyve left our borders wide open at home we send our troops to fight and die and defend their borders but we dont care about our borders were more interested defending the borders of countries that a lot of people have never even heard of its unbelievable think of it we fight to defend the border in some place far away but we dont even have borders in our country that will change on november th and by the way the truth is i want people to come into our country we are going to have he just said it a big and beautiful door were going to have the big beautiful doors but they are going to come into our country legally really they are coming into our country legally and the process is going to be speeded up and its going to be brought into a modern age its now archaic people on line for  to  years but people are going to come and we want people to come into our country but they are going to come in through a process they are going to come in legally a trump administration will never ever put the interests of a foreign country before the interests of our country im not running to be president of the world believe me im running to be president of our great united states of america and from the day i take office it will be always america first  to all americans i say its time for change and its time for new leadership can you imagine four years of hillary clinton i mean seriously forget about running forget about the race can you imagine four more years of isis four more years of high taxes four more years of nothing but problems in addition to all of the legalities that shes done ayayay i dont even like to think about it just think about in closing what we can accomplish in the first  days of a trump administration we are going to have the biggest tax cuts since ronald reagan she is raising taxes very seriously you saw her tax increase its massive you know we are the highest taxed nation in the world and she wants to raise taxes we are going to eliminate so many different things but our taxes are going to weigh it down and were going to get rid of all unnecessary jobkilling regulations we are going to cancel every illegal obama executive order we will protect religious liberty rebuild our military and we are going to take great care as ive said of our veterans provide school choice and put an end to common core were bringing education local we will support the great men and women of law enforcement were going to save our second amendment which is under siege and appoint justices to the supreme court who will hold and you know this this is one of the most serious things justice scalia died very unexpectedly we have one the next president could appoint as many as three or four i mean theres even a scenario it could be five if we dont get this right we will not have a country many people think its like the most important thing so we are going to appoint justices to the united states supreme court who will uphold and protect the constitution of the united states for all those people that dont even mention that its one of the really important elements to what were doing and one of the very most important things that we are going to be doing  it is time to cut our ties with the failed politicians of the past hillary clinton is a candidate of yesterday we are the movement of the future we are fighting for every citizen who believes that government should serve the people not the donors and not the special interests we are fighting to save everything honestly were fighting to save everything were not just looking at having a strong military and having  we are fighting to save everything our country is a total mess you just take a look you just take a look we are also fighting to get rid of sanctuary cities we are fighting to get rid of sanctuary cities we are fighting to save the next worker from being laid off when their job is shipped unexpectedly to another country we are fighting to save our government from crime and corruption you look at whats happening our government is being eaten alive cronyism and kick the crooks out of washington dc dont let the pundits the politicians or the media tell you what kind of a country you have dont let them limit your dreams because they want to limit your dreams you can have any future you want all we have to do is stop believing in our failed politicians and start believing in america again  i am asking you to reject the cynics and to dream big because with your vote  we are just four days can you believe it four days this started on june th of last year it seemed like it was never going to end seventeen people  people one by one by one they said donald trump is inexperienced ive been in politics all my life but ive been on the other side of the equation i must say but one by one by one and then they disappeared some great people ben carson supporting us incredible mike huckabee so many great i mean so many great almost of them great people and we actually do have a very unified republican party i will tell you but most importantly were going to make such great decisions for this country  were going to make such great  youre going to be so proud so think of it june th of last year and now its four days away from the change youve been waiting for your entire life youre going to think back to this day and youre going to say that was a great day that was a beautiful day i even like mr trumps plane made in america by the way it was great made in america and they dont make them like that anywhere else but you are going to say this was a very very important day because it led to your vote on november th or whenever you do it before that is fine just as long as you do it do it any time you want but do it and our country started winning again we started winning with trade we started doing things properly we built up our military we knocked the hell out of isis we started winning again we took care of healthcare we got great healthcare at a much much much lower cost its unacceptable but we started winning again together we are going to make america wealthy again we will make america so very strong again we will make america safe again and we will make america great again thank you very much everyone thank you god bless you everybody god bless you  get out and vote thank you thank you everybody"
109,"Trump","thank you very much wow wow    thank you very much folks now we have a little difficulty because we have about  people maybe  outside should we wait for them to come in   i agree lets get going you people were here from like  in the morning they tell me  but were going to get going thank you very much and we dont need jayz to fill up arenas you know we do it the oldfashioned way we do it the oldfashioned way folks we fill them up because you love what were saying and you want to make america great again thats about it  and i actually like jayz but you know the language last night oh ooh i was thinking maybe ill just try it should i use that language if i want to   can you imagine if i said that so  he used every word in the book i wont even use the initials because ill get in trouble theyll get me in trouble he used every word in the book last night and by the way in hershey pennsylvania last night we had an arena we had  people show up maybe they couldnt get in far more  far more than jayz had with their free tickets free tickets far more and beyonce and i like them both but he used language last night that was so bad and then hillary said i did not like donald trumps lewd language  my lewd language i tell you what  ive never said what he said in my life but that shows you the phoniness of politicians and the phoniness of the whole system folks  in three days we are going to win the great state of florida  and we are going to win back the white house  real change begins with immediately repealing and replacing obamacare  its just been announced that the residents of florida  im sorry to tell you this  are going to experience a massive doubledigit premium hike and i know what it is i say this to everybody i know  i just dont want to destroy the spirit in the room its going to be a massive hike so congratulations its not going to matter because if we win im throwing it out anyway so it doesnt make any difference but get ready youre going to have a big big big hike hopefully it wont make a damn bit of difference in the great state of arizona where i was just a couple of days ago and where im going premiums are going up by more than  percent  going to go higher than that over  percent of the counties in florida are losing obamacare insure and think of it theyre losing their insurers over  percent of the counties and remember  and most of you were there  almost all of you felt this whole movement right from the beginning when we came down for the primaries right we won  out of  counties  out of  florida is just a place i love my second home im here all the time  i might know florida better than you do but my second home but we won  out of  counties thats never happened before we almost  we almost won that last one too and i see maybe even more enthusiasm right now than i did then i think theres more enthusiasm  you see the tremendous lines of people and they have trump hats on make america great again but they have trump hats on and they have buttons and they have shirts and theyre on line and you see nbc and you see these people  total phonies the most dishonest people and theyll say it looks like its going  there was one line where it was like  percent with trump regalia now maybe theyre in disguise maybe theyre wearing buttons shirts and trump hats but theyre actually going to vote for crooked hillary do you think thats possible   but you see these lines and the woman says yes id say its very evenly based so the great state of texas you heard  you heard  can you believe all these people at  oclock in the morning  great they got here at  oclock in the morning many of them so the great state of texas an incredible place i go there we have these massive crowds and about two weeks ago i was hearing the phonies in the media and theyre going very very strongly texas is in play oh we have a hillary clinton person are they paying that person   get em out please get em out   i must tell you the bernie sanders protesters had much more enthusiasm and spirit than this one the problem with these hillary protesters is my people make all the noise theyre always going there there you cant even hear the person by the way did you see  before i get to texas did you see yesterday obama screaming and screaming   and screaming just like the way he runs the country nobody listens to him screaming ok and i wanted to see the protesters because these lying thieving people back there the media they dont ever show  they dont ever show my crowds  i was saying to them the other night hershey i was saying youve got to show  youve got to turn the camera they just  every one of them right up my face right the only time theyll turn the cameras is if theres a protester because thats a bad thing right so last night obama had a protestor and they wouldnt turn the camera to the protester its the first time ive ever seen that they kept it on him but it was bad because he kept screaming the same thing over and over again and nobody would listen to him but they had the great state of texas so  about three weeks ago theyd say  you know they do these phony polls right some of the polls are great i only really acknowledge them if im winning so  and by the way were winning in a lot of polls  a lot of polls  we dont have enough time to talk about it now theres too many of them oh i love those signs blacks for trump hohoho oh that seems to be  that seems to be the big surprise so far of this election blacks for trump thank you fellas thats so great thank you so  that is great thank you thank you very much  thats a great honor believe me thats a great honor so they kept saying the great state of texas is in play now you know its supposed to be sort of a republican stronghold not supposed to be in play i said oh man i call my people whats going on with texas because i was just there we had a crowd    every time i went we had these massive crowds they had a line that went so long that local media is much more honest than these dishonest guys you know the local media  and they were showing the line went all the way  it went  literally it went miles so then i get back and three weeks ago texas is in play its even and i say thats bad news bad i dont want to lose texas thats bad news one little problem one little problem were killing them in texas were killing them  a guy gets on two days ago a man named sid miller dont really know him wearing a big beautiful white cowboy hat in fact i want to find out where he got it its pretty nice and he said you know you folks are getting it all wrong these lines are four five six blocks long weve never had anything like this in texas and let me tell you all those folks theyre all voting for trump theyre not voting for anyone else  so texas were just absolutely  were doing great in texas but were doing great in new hampshire were doing great in iowa were doing great in ohio ohio just left going back again soon doing phenomenally well in north carolina  i think were going to win pennsylvania  i think were going to win pennsylvania were right there i saw they had  you know and even is not like my thing you know were even but they had me way down in pennsylvania then last night im looking two or three polls came out jim trump is  hes even now in pennsylvania too this is not  you know you can see the  because they protect hillary i dont understand it i dont understand why  when this is all over with im going to sit down with the dishonest media im going to have an honest talk why what is she going to do shes  shes a dishonest person she has no energy you know you need energy to help this country like for instance im going to be doing five or six of these every day you need energy here folks she goes home and she goes to sleep   you need a lot of energy so were going to be doing at least five of these today the arenas are all packed all over the country and were going into different locations were going into what they used to call democrat strongholds where were now either tied or leading were going to minnesota  were going up to minnesota which traditionally has not been republican at all and were doing phenomenally we just saw a poll were going to colorado where were doing phenomenally well were doing well everywhere were doing well in places that they dont believe theyre saying whats going on anyway with obamacare getting back to the boring subject  its almost a waste of time talking about it because when we terminate it all well do is say it was a bad experience for the american people you know  premiums are surging because of obamacare companies are leaving insurers are fleeing doctors are quitting and deductibles are going through the roof some as high as  some higher than that yet hillary clinton wants to double down on obamacare making it even much more expensive going to make it much more expensive  you know what theyre going to do her and obama theyre going to show you  and they dont care what it takes  theyre going to show you that it works theyre going to listen to trump never give up ok theyre going to show you ok we dont want to be shown ill tell you what it is catastrophic im asking for your vote so we can repeal and replace obamacare and have health care for every family in florida and great health care real change also means restoring honesty to our government  as you know the fbi  and i give them a lot of credit because theyre fighting forces that theyre not supposed to be fighting  has reopened its criminal investigation into hillary clinton  theyre also conducting a second criminal investigation into hillary clintons payforplay corruption at the state department you see whats happening there it has been confirmed that the  emails they discovered  by accident  can you believe it  emails oh thats a treasure trove that is going to be a lot of bad emails in there they discovered it on anthony weiners  think of that  can you imagine anthony weiner has probably every classified email ever sent and knowing this guy he probably studied every single one in between using his machine for other purposes  including brandnew emails not previously turned over to authorities likely including some very very classified information however the reports also show that the political leadership at the department of justice is trying very hard and as hard as they can to protect their angel hillary  remember bill clinton just happened when he was in phoenix arizona just happened to see her plane the attorney generals plane oh theres the attorney general oh what a  what an unbelievable  he was going to play golf it was about  degrees he was going to play golf oh i was going to play golf let me say hello hey lets get together boom i thought it was  minutes turned out to be  minutes so went onto the plane on the tarmac and right on the tarmac and they had a meeting for  minutes right before she was supposed to issue her judgment on hillary and maybe bill bill could be a target who knows because of whats going on so she met with him for  minutes they discussed golf thats about two minutes they discussed grandchildren give them five the rest of the time what do you think they discussed i would say like i hope youre going to be a part of our administration what do you think what a disgrace ill tell you what our country has never been in a situation like its in right now never been so dishonest its a rigged system folks ive been saying it its a rigged system and it begins with the media because the media rigs it the media rigs it  did you see all those reports where the new york times is sending them things and theyre saying listen weve got this reporter essentially  percent this is friendly stuff where other reporters are sending them stories to check do you have any change its never happened to me man i used to  actually i used to get good publicity until i decided to run now i think i have  and they even say  actually the times said one of the writers at the times said we dont care we dont care if its fair or not its so out of control we dont care its the greatest pileon in the history of politics and thats ok i used to be on the other side dont forget i did very well but i also love our country and it was time it was time we had to do something it was time  but thats a big part right there a big part of the rigged system remember john podesta said hillary clinton has bad instincts right and i say to people id fire him if he was saying bad  he says so many bad things about her and hes her top person he knows her well and i dont want a president with bad instincts and she does all you have to do is look at her record bernie sanders says that shes got bad judgment hillary created an illegal server to shield her criminal activity thats why theres no other reason and then she  and she figured she was above it because she figured the department of justice will never do anything to get in her way ok its a rigged system the department of justice if that happened to anybody else they would have been in jail two years ago folks ok what she did then she illegally destroyed  and this is  this is  forget about what happened last friday im talking about the past forget about that  thats all gravy whatever happened what she did in the past is so bad she destroyed   remember this   emails after receiving a congressional subpoena  the key word being after  and made  phones disappear some with a hammer   if she were to win it would create an unprecedented constitutional crisis remember if she ever got into the oval office hillary and her special interests and her donors would rob this country blind i have no doubt about it my contract with the american voter begins with a plan to end government corruption and to take back our country from the special interests  i want the entire corrupt washington establishment to hear the words we  we are about to say when we win on november th we are going to drain the swamp going to do it  theyre not happy folks theyre not happy there are a lot of unhappy people around at the core of my contract is my plan to bring back your jobs that have been stolen stolen by either very stupid politicians or corrupt politicians meaning special interests get them to do whatever they want them to do florida has lost one in four of its manufacturing jobs since nafta a deal signed by bill clinton and supported by hillary  america has lost  factories  thats such a hard number to believe   since china entered the world trade organization another bill and hillarybacked disaster we are living through the greatest jobs theft in the history of the world theres never been a country thats lost jobs like we do so stupidly so easy to solve so stupidly   goodrich lighting systems  we will i promise i promise  goodrich lighting systems laid off  workers and moved their jobs to india baxter health care corporation laid off  workers and moved their jobs to singapore essilor laboratories laid off  workers and moved their jobs surprise to mexico tremendous tremendous jobs and its worse  its getting worse and worse and worse i mean we have with some of these countries  mexico in particular  i have a great relationship with mexico i met with the mexican president three months ago   believe me oh well build a wall dont even think about it well build a wall dont worry about it    and you know what the harder they fight us the higher it goes ok i promise  no but i met with the president of mexico look  and hes a good guy good guy good meeting all of that but  look we have a onelane highway goes right into mexico it takes our jobs takes our money takes our wealth takes everything we get unemployment and we get drugs not going to happen anymore folks a trump administration will stop the jobs from leaving america and will stop the jobs from leaving the great state of florida that i can tell you  the theft of american prosperity will end quickly and effectively if a company wants to fire their workers leave florida move to another country and then shift their product back into the united states we will make them pay a tax of  percent  ok that it problem solved problem solved ninetynine percent  and you never heard this talk before you know they give them loans oh we want you to stay they dont even talk to most of them you know most of them just leave nobody talks to them well talk to them and at first  at first well be very nice right first well be very nice and respectful and when they tell us no no no then well say ok heres the story folks lets not be nice anymore and you know whats going to happen with that tax theyre never going to leave this country theyre never leaving he knows theyre never going to leave this country a trump administration will renegotiate nafta and if we dont get the deal we want we will terminate nafta and get a much better deal for our workers  we will immediately stop the jobkilling transpacific partnership another disaster in the making that hillary clinton said is the gold standard yeah its the gold standard for other countries not for us the gold standard for the countries that want to be part of that deal as part of our plan to bring back jobs were going to lower taxes on american business from  percent to  percent were the highest taxed nation in the world one of the main reasons that theyre leaving we will massively cut taxes for the middle class also  and by the way dont hear it from me just look at it hillary clinton is going to raise taxes substantially highest taxed nation she wants to raise taxes substantially thats not going to happen we will also cancel billions in global warming payments to the united nations and use that money to invest in america  that includes repairing so many of floridas problems   thank you thank you were going to repair so many of floridas problems and everyones problems including the herbert hoover dike which is big problem and the florida aquifer and were going to protect the everglades were going to do all of the things  but were going to have so much money left over folks you know what we want you know what we want we want really beautiful clean air right we want really crystal crystal clean water and we want safety we dont need to give hundreds of billions of dollars away  we have no idea whos getting this money  giving it to the united nations you know what thats called giving it to an open pit you know how political the united  can you imagine as these guys are doling out that money no no were going to keep our money here and were going to take care of our infrastructure and were going to take care of our environment and were going to lower taxes  we will also rebuild our inner cities the africanamerican community has been treated terribly terribly thats why im so honored to see those signs and im telling you thats turning out to be the story of this election the africanamerican vote  watch you watch theyve been treated very unfairly africanamerican and hispanic people living in the inner cities  theres no  oh you like that hispanics huh  how many hispanics do we have here  and by the way thats a big story you know as you know the cubans just endorsed me they gave me the bay of pigs association award  well be making a much different deal than they made with castro believe me folks theyre very happy but thats another story thats turning out to be very big the hispanic vote is turning out to be much different than people thought but the africanamerican community the hispanic community folks living in the inner cities crimeridden  you cant walk to the store and buy a loaf of bread you get shot the education is the worst and theres no jobs were going to fix the education were going to bring back jobs and were going to bring back safety and i say to the hispanic community living in the innercity to the africanamerican community i say what the hell do you have to lose im going to fix it im going to fix it i am going to fix it  you know the democrats have been running that whole thing for up to  years unbroken and they come in they say we want your vote we youre your vote and then you give them the vote  you know this fellas right you know that they know you give them their vote and they disappear for four years they say see ya folks see ya in four years and then they come back again and again we have to show them it doesnt work that way anymore and theyll never be able to do  theyll never be able to do what i do look im here  im doing five or six of these a day and hillary goes home she goes to sleep if she wanted to do it which she doesnt she doesnt have the energy to do it believe me we will become a rich nation again but to be a rich nation we must also be a safe nation hillary clinton wants a  percent increase in syrian refugees pouring into this country   over and above the thousands and thousands and thousands that are already coming in do you want to see a problem this will be the great trojan horse modern day version her plan will import generations of terrorism extremism and radicalism into your schools and throughout your communities when im elected president we will suspend immediately the syrian refugee program   and we will keep radical islamic terrorists the hell out of our country  you look at whats happened in france you look at whats happened in germany no and we all have big hearts well build safe havens well get the gulf states to put up the money we owe  you know we owe  what do we owe  trillion we owe  trillion think of it but ill get the gulf states  they have plenty of money they have so much money they dont know what to do with it they just have to be told nicely right theyre going to put up the money well build safe havens in syria but we cant have this folks we have enough problems we dont need these kind of problems a trump administration will also secure and defend the borders of the united states  and as we said yes we will build a great wall  we received the firstever endorsement issued by americas ice and border patrol officers its just been reported that as a result of our open borders violent cartels have spread into all  states more than  percent of those arrested are here illegally arent you shocked ninety percent  think of that   percent are here illegally   thank you darling i love you too its so nice oh look a future construction worker look look at that baby hes so cute oh give me that baby  future construction worker  they did a great job wow that is a great beautiful baby congratulations thats an early trump fan right thats an early united states fan anyway back to the basics after going through that i hate to say this but these terrorists are killing innocent americans threatening schools and destroying our communities a government that will not protect its people is a government that is unworthy to lead thats all as secretary of state hillary clinton allowed thousands of the most dangerous and violent criminals to come into the country go free and wouldnt send them back to their home countries and when they did their home  their home countries very very intelligently said we dont want them take them back and we would never force them in i promise you when we take these killers and gang members and drug lords back to their countries they will be accepted gladly by their country ok thank you so much for bringing this killer back mr trump we totally appreciate it theyll say president trump thank you sir we very much like it were so so happy mr president we are so so happy to have our drug lords back to have our killers back to have our gang members back thank you mr president on behalf of  i wont use the name of the country hillary supports total open borders  that means the end of your country  and strongly supports sanctuary cities like san francisco where kate steinle was murdered by an illegal immigrant and deported this was a man deported probably more than five times thousands of americans would be alive today if not for the open border policies of barack obama and hillary clinton  and by the way  and ive said it  this guy is campaigning fulltime she cant campaign for herself nobody shows up to her meetings the only way she gets them to show up is when she has a star come thats the only way otherwise she gets  people  people and by the way the cameras never show that can you imagine if i had a small crowd there would be headlines all over the world trump is not  you know is not doing it right but she has these little crowds show up its a big problem look she cant do more than one or two a day because she has no energy but she cant do it because they cant get any people but obama goes and campaigns for her he ought to spend time in the oval office getting jobs defeating isis strengthening up our border among those killed americans like josh wilkerson whose mother ive gotten to know during this campaign josh was a student in a high school great student he was murdered at the age of  he was tortured strangled and beaten to death by an illegal immigrant who should have never been in our country and then his body was set on fire you ought to look at the remembrance project these people are amazing people these are people that suffered so much last year right here in florida yearold starlette pitts her boyfriend and her mother were viciously stabbed to death in their lehigh acres home by an illegal immigrant the killer had been convicted of assaulting a police officer and was wanted for double murder and robbery but he was released from custody enabling him to commit these and other horrible crimes and the people that knew him begged that he be incarcerated or begged that he be thrown the hell out of our country and the obama administration with their weak policies refused to listen death a trump administration will end this nightmare of violence we will protect american lives we will cancel all federal funding of sanctuary cities  very quickly we will stop illegal immigration deport every last criminal alien and dismantle every criminal gang and cartel threatening our great citizens  when we win this election you will finally have a government on your side fighting for your community and protecting your family  we will also repeal the obamaclinton defense sequester and rebuild our badly depleted military greatest people on earth  that means brandnew modern aircraft from macdill and  we have to do this anybody  macdill were going to have beautiful beautiful new  you know right now our fighter jets some are so old they cant get parts they dont make them anymore   years old they did a big documentary about it were going to take care of those brandnew beautiful jets out of macdill ok  im honored to have the endorsement of more than  top admirals and generals and  medal of honor recipients i actually heard we picked up about five today and i want to thank the coach from getting up here and talking to you people what a great coach and joe and your attorney general you have so many great people all the people that got up and spoke i want to thank them theyre speaking all over the country theyre speaking all over the country hillary brought death and disaster to iraq syria libya and she empowered iran theyve been empowered theyve been emboldened we gave them  billion and they hate us but now theyre strong weve created them weve  they were ready to die they were ready to come back and make any deal we wanted and we took them out of the ashes and we made them perhaps a world power not just a regional power all hillary clintons thinking bad judgment bad instincts and she unleashed isis all across the world during the debates did i win the debates did i win the debates  you know i was a little worried about the debate because for a week and a half id hear shes not going out of her house shes doing debate prep i said wait a minute how can you work that  i mean youre supposed to know this stuff right you know i mean she has a lot of experience thats the one thing she has shes got a lot of experience but its all bad experience its experience of losing but she kept doing debate prep right and i felt guilty i said gee i dont want to sit  and what am i going to do in debate  you mean  hours a day for a weekandahalf i cant do that were supposed to know the subject arent we were supposed to know the subject anyway she did debate prep i dont think it helped her very much hillary and her failed establishment have spent  trillion on wars in the middle east that we never win by the way we fight we keep fighting we fight fight fight and i always say general douglas macarthur general george patton what are they doing theyre spinning in their graves they cant believe it mosul we go into mosul ladies and gentlemen we will be attacking mosul in four months from now oh now the people of mosul  you know these guys are tough and theyre smart in all fairness so the isis  one of the reasons were going to mosul is we want to get the isis leaders we think theyre staying in mosul and we want to get them well before the announcement is over theyve gone whatever happened to the element of surprise the element of surprise what a group of losers we have and now its a very tough battle theyre dug in its a very  much tougher than they thought much tougher than they thought no we need different thinking in this country folks they should have kept their mouths shut quietly quickly and viciously go in and then have a news conference when its over a week later right and im convinced they only did that for political reasons they thought it was going to be a great quick victory it wasnt its a disaster they thought it was going to be a quick victory and you know hillary is running and then shell get credit oh shes  shes  except for one problem we already had mosul so we gave it up because of the way they got out and then isis was formed isis is now in  countries but during the debate i watched and shes saying were going to fix our tax code well why didnt you do it because all of her people do the same thing were all doing the same thing and were going to fix our tax code were going to do this were going to do that were going to fix this and i kept saying youve been there for  years why didnt you do it it will never happen theyve dragged us into foreign wars that have made us less safe shipped our goods and our wealth and our companies to other countries and theyve left our borders wide open so we have no borders and yet were over fighting for countries that a lot of people in this room have never heard of and we want a border were fighting so they have a border but we dont protect our own border that will change on november th  a trump administration will never ever put the interests of a foreign country before the interest of our country  from now on its going to be america first to all americans i say it is time for change it is time for new leadership  and in closing i want you to think about   thank you folks i just see a sign that i love let

110,"Trump","wow what a great room on quick notice  on quick notice we didnt bring any socalled  socalled stars along we didnt need them  you know the reason hillary has to do that is nobody comes for her deal  she cant fill a room we can get stars we dont need them because we just want to make america great again and we know what to do right  we dont need that thats almost like a form of cheating right  thats like when she got the questions from donna brazile to the debate right  and she didnt report it she went into the debate isnt that amazing by the way that took place and not one of the dishonest crooked media mentioned that nobody mentions it  nobody mentions it they go after donna brazile  who cares  but nobody says wait a minute she got the questions she went into the debate nobody says anything why didnt she reported to ethics or to somebody you know why because she is crooked hillary thats why folks  in three days we are going to win  the great state of nevada  and we are going to win back the white house  we need you all to go and vote on tuesday and bring your friends and family to those polls were going to have a big big victory they didnt get the kind of vote that they needed to stop us on tuesday you know what that means right they didnt get the numbers they were looking for youre going to have a big big day tuesday is our day in the state so  tuesday so you got to get out there well never have this opportunity again not going to happen again reno and northern nevada can carry this state and can carry us all the way to washington and the white house  this will be our last chance but dont let crazy broken harry reid and his corrupt political machine  decide this election for you  crazy harry remember he said four years ago that he found out with surety that romney didnt pay tax and called him also lots of names remember and then it turned out he did pay tax but the election was over and they said  but you lied he said we won didnt we you know i was right about that but thats a political hack for instance its being reported that certain key democratic polling locations in clark county were kept open for hours and hours beyond closing time to bus and bring democratic voters in  folks its a rigged system its a rigged system and were going to beat it were going to beat it  ive been saying its a rigged system obama who does nothing but campaign for hillary because she cant campaign for herself hes out there and he said donald trump is hurting the foundations of our country by talking about rigging the election excuse me eight years ago he was talking about chicago and how they rigged the votes ok this guy give  you know what i say to president obama give me a break  phony  and its up to the great people of washoe county to get it done get it done you got to get it done  you are the people youre going to get it done and dont forget in this state ive spent hundreds of millions of dollars building things we have great success in this state i have great great employees so i feel i have an awfully big state i come here all the time i love it but to do that and to win you have to get every single person that you know to the polls with you you have to vote with your heart and i know youre going to do that you have to vote with your soul to make america great again  real change means restoring honesty to our government  thank you everybody thank you boy a lot  a lot of spirit in this room huh  a lot of spirit a lot of spirit the place is great the people here are great the people in this state from day one first time i came here many many years ago the people in this state are amazing so great  the state is going to have a very big impact or the outcome of our country  forget the election  on the outcome of our country because if we win on tuesday our country is going to start winning again  were going to start winning again we dont win anymore as you know the fbi has reopened its criminal investigation  into hillary clinton following the discovery of another  emails probably including the  emails that hillary destroyed after receiving a congressional subpoena  they are also  folks folks folks she shouldnt be allowed to run ok  and im not talking about what happened last friday im talking about right now she shouldnt be allowed to run when you look at general cartwright fourstar general for doing almost nothing by comparison could serve five years in jail that happened two weeks ago general petraeus destroyed their lives for doing nothing by comparison how about the young man took pictures of his submarine he wanted to have some pictures the submarine is not like its a brand new submarine its many years old they put them in jail for a year and she does all of these different things theyre also conducting a second criminal investigation into hillarys illegal payforplay corruption at the state department  theres virtually no doubt that fbi director comey and the great great special agents of the fbi will be able to collect more than enough evidence to garner indictments against hillary clinton and her inner circle despite her efforts to disparage them and to discredit them if she were to win this election it would create an unprecedented constitutional crisis in that situation we could very well have a sitting president under felony indictment and ultimately a criminal trial  it would grind government to a halt of course thats what we have right now under obama anyway we need a government that can work and work well from day one for the american people  that will be impossible with hillary clinton the prime suspect in a massive farreaching criminal investigation her current scandals and controversies will continue throughout her presence and will make it virtually impossible for her to govern or lead our country now i dont think its going to matter because shes not going to win but well  lets  lets go through the scenario  by the way does anybody speak better about this subject than our legendary mayor rudy giuliani does anybody huh  hes the greatest  come here special guy new york was crimeinfested filthy dirty problems all over the place rudy came in he straightened it out  straightened it out thank you rudy for everything if she ever got into the oval office hillary and her special interests would rob our country blind you see whats going on  at the heart of this election is one simple question will our country be governed by the people or by the corrupt political class  if we win the corrupt politicians and her special interests will lose if they win the american will lose its just that simple the political elites in this country have used their power to enrich themselves at your expense they have run the government for their benefit and theyve profited from your pain you see whats happening and by the way folks youre highly sophisticated and i always say i have the smartest people smartest  the smartest and i have the most loyal people  by far and thats borne out in every poll they take in fact they are very worried you know with all the polls that are happening were winning all over the place were winning in iowa it just came out were seven points up  were winning in ohio  were winning in new hampshire  were winning in north carolina  i think were going to win the great state of pennsylvania  based on turnout i think were going to win florida  and you know where else were going to win right here  so this is the choice on tuesday either we will have a government run by the donors and the special interests who control everything and control crooked hillary clinton  or we will have a government run by you the american people thats what were doing   there has never been a movement like this in the history of the united states  and you know i couldnt say that if it werent true because of these very very dishonest reporters back there in the media  they would call us out for that theres never been a movement like this never been the crowds which they never show by the way they never show this was setup so recently and look at all the people theres never been the crowds theres never been the enthusiasm and theres never been the loyalty that we have never been in this country  and someday theyll start reporting it correctly but i almost think it doesnt matter because we get it we get it total dishonesty and while they are there show the cameras show the crowds fellas go ahead show the crowd show the crowd  go ahead show the crowd spread those cameras they never like  the only time they do it is where theres a protester because thats a negative thing it turned out that the protesters we used to have were bought for  a piece and they were told to go in and incite riots  and they cover the protesters but last night obama had a protester  and nobody would listen to him he kept saying the same thing over and over  nasty  over and over and over but they never showed the protester with him because thats a negative thing they just kept it on him but it was a pretty bad scene let me tell you the way he acted if you want a government that will secure your borders stop the massive inflow of refugees  lower your taxes bring back your jobs  grow your economy and protect your family always  vote for donald j trump  tuesday thats going to be a big day thank you everybody what a crowd  what people what people greatest people in the world ill tell you folks this country all over no matter where we go no matter where we go we were in hershey pennsylvania the other night unbelievable we did numerous  all over north carolina unbelievable no matter where we go  florida texas remember last week they were reporting texas is in play  texas texas is in play you know like that was bad because she was supposed to win texas easily i said im surprised texas is in play because i was there we have this massive crowds actually rudy was there we had a line that must have been two miles long getting in and thats because the place was small those were the people that didnt get in and so i said im surprised two weeks  texas is in play unfortunately that turned out to be a lie also the media  maybe they meant  maybe they meant texas is in play for trump i guess because  the great state great state of texas so a man calls up good guy  he calls up one of the  he said yeah ive been hearing for three to four weeks texas is in play well we have the longest lines ive ever seen and most of those people have trump on their shirt and they have trump buttons and trump hats and to the best of my knowledge they will not be voting for hillary clinton  so as soon as the media looked at this recordsetting vote they took texas is in play out of their vocabulary these are really dishonest people my contract with the american voter begins with a plan to end government corruption and take your country back from the special interests  and i used to be on the other side until june th of last year i went from being an insider boy did i become an outsider fast  well that was the quickest outsider but you know what i love this country i saw what was happening it was going bad we were really going bad if you look at the iran deal  billion look at a deal where we give these guys the number one terror nation we give them  billion in cash  cash  for hostages which was a lie when he said it was  remember it was supposed to be  million think of this  million in cash but that turned out to be wrong it was  billion you know what  billion in cash you could fill up that whole side of this big arena i want the entire corrupt washington establishment to hear the words of all of us when we win on november th we are going to drain the swamp    were going to do it were going to bring in the right people were going to really turn things around this is ridiculous whats going on real change also begins with immediately repealing and replacing obamacare  you know i shouldnt tell you this youve probably seen it but i always use your state as the example for the premiums going up you know why we think you have the highest in the country i dont want to tell you that i dont want to tell you that but i always use your state theyre all going up through but you have the highest youre going to experience a massive doubledigit premium hike the great state right the great state that you live in is going up numbers i will not tell you in arizona  ill give you an example  theyre going up  percent  ten of nevadas  counties will have only one obamacare exchange insurer to choose from next year good luck with that negotiation good luck with that negotiation good luck and your numbers are going to be really high but im not going to depress you but i know what they are i want you to be happy when you leave but actually you will because were going to get rid of obamacare anyway so youre not going to have to pay dont bother  were going to have great health care at much less cost and its going to be much better whats going on with obamacare is  never had a chance to work and i said it before they even submitted it for a vote and then obama started lying that you can keep your plan you can keep your doctor he said it  different times and in all fairness even the democrats that werent going to vote for it got swayed by him they wished they didnt do it now i will tell you premiums are surging companies are leaving insurers are fleeing doctors are quitting and deductibles are through the roof you have deductibles sometimes  yet hillary clinton wants to double down on obamacare making it even more expensive  im asking for your vote so we can repeal and replace obamacare and save health care for every family in nevada  and for every family in this country at the core of my contract is my plan  so important  to bring back your jobs  america has lost onethird of its manufacturing jobs since nafta a deal signed by bill clinton and supported by hillary clinton  america has lost  factories  can you believe that number i always thought it was a mistake ive been saying that number now for two weeks i cant believe it   i always think maybe  maybe    factories since china entered the world trade organization another bill and hillary backed disaster  we are living through the greatest jobs theft in the history of the world nobody has ever stolen jobs like other countries have taken them from us a trump administration will stop the jobs from leaving america so easily and we will stop the jobs from leaving nevada  the theft of american prosperity will end and it will end immediately we will renegotiate nafta and if we dont get the deal we want we will terminate nafta and get a much better deal for our workers and our companies  we will also immediately stop the jobkilling transpacific partnership which hillary clinton lied in the debate by the way did i win those debates please  thank you she kept saying shes in debate prep  for weeks she was in debate prep i kept saying you know i felt guilty i said there must be something to this debate prep she just didnt want to go out campaigning it was a good excuse i mean when youre doing this  shes doing it for  years right more i always say youve been doing it for so long if you want to change the tax code why didnt you do it you want to fight isis why didnt you do it i mean she created isis really it came out of the vacuum now isis is in  countries she wont do anything with isis but why dont you fix the things you want to fix you talk about it why dont you do it you want to bring back jobs bring back jobs in new york state she said she was going to bring back jobs upstate new york it became a total disaster everyone left you have to see it today greatest people but you have to see what happened to upstate new york as part of our plan to bring back jobs we are going to lower taxes on american business from  percent to  percent  we are going to massively cut taxes for the middle class the forgotten people  and we will rebuild our inner cities which are absolutely a shame watch out and for the africanamerican community and for the latino community  remember this the inner cities  so unfair  the democrats have run them for over  years in many cases unbroken and every four years they come in and ask for your vote  we want your vote and after you give them the vote and they win an election they say see you in four years they dont do anything the crime is horrible you cant walk to a store and get a loaf of bread without being shot in many cases you see whats happening the crime is horrible the education is practically non existent its so bad and jobs are gone there are no jobs and i say were going to fix the crime were going to fix the education were going to bring back jobs we are going to rebuild the inner cities and the african  its true its not  going to be hard there were such potential we have such incredible potential in our inner cities were going to fix our inner cities and the africanamerican community the latino community youre going to be so thankful youre going to love it and i say to you and i say this because the democrats have let you down for decades and decades and decades i say to you what the hell do you have to lose right  what do you have to lose i will fix it we are going to fix the inner cities were going to bring back jobs were going to make them safe theres straighten out education we will become a rich nation once again but to be a rich nation we must also be a safe nation hillary clinton wants a  percent increase in syrian refugees pouring into our country  her plan will import generations of terrorism extremism and radicalism into your schools and into your communities  when im elected president if you vote otherwise its not going to work out you got to vote  we will suspend the syrian refugee program  and we will keep radical islamic terrorists the hell out of our country   we got no choice  we got no choice  thank you a trump administration will also secure and defend the borders of the united states  and yes we will build a wall  we will build a wall itll be a great wall and it have big doors in it and people will come through those doors but theyll come through those doors legally we want people to come in legally  and well stop the drugs from pouring into our nation and destroying our youth and poisoning all  so many people so many people were going to stop the drugs from pouring in believe me as secretary of state hillary clinton allowed thousands of the most dangerous and violent criminal aliens to go free because their home countries very intelligently would not take them back they didnt want murders they didnt want gang members they didnt want drug lords but i promise you this when we bring them back to their countries not once  not once will they ever come back to us in this life  not once  hillary supports totally open borders  there goes your country and strongly supports sanctuary cities like san francisco where kate steinle was murdered  by an illegal immigrant deported more than five times thousands of americans would be alive today if not for the open border policies of obama and clinton on mothers day in  carson cityborn yearold rene angulo was out driving looking for a job when he was shot in the head and brutally murdered by a previously deported illegal immigrant gang member who everybody that knew this gang member said please get him out of the country please put him in prison he must be incarcerated rene was pulled from his vehicle and left to die on the side of a road a good samaritan who thought there had been a car accident stopped to help and was violently shot the illegal immigrant killer had a previous conviction involving murder in carson city but was released and allowed to roam free and did further damage after that  other story after story we could go for days and days and days this story after story one worse than the other a trump administration will end this nightmare of violence we will protect american lives we will cancel all federal funding to sanctuary cities  we will stop illegal immigration and by the way i have tremendous support within the hispaniclatino community  tremendous  because they came here  they came here legally they want to see borders they have their jobs which are great jobs they have their homes they want to keep their homes they want to keep their jobs they want other members of their families to come into our country and they will come in they will come into our country were going to have other members of your families come in theyll go through a process and it wont be a process like you have now where people wait  and  years before they get in well have a streamlined beautiful process it will be efficient it will be efficient not the way it is now so weve had this tremendous outpouring of love from the hispanic community a certain radio station in new york said the owner of the station was in another show and its all spanish and he was being interviewed and he said you know i dont know about this whole thing with trump because everybody that calls us  every single person is in favor  is in favor of trump so were going to have tremendous  i think were going to have tremendous hispaniclatino support on tuesday tremendous i think its going to be tremendous  we have one of those guys from  from the hillary clinton campaign  how much are you being paid  all right take him out  when we win the election on tuesday you will finally have a government on your side fighting for your community and protecting your family  by the way folks while were at it great      very much  thank you nobody said it was going to be easy for us  but we will never be stopped never ever be stopped  i want to thank the secret service these guys are fantastic  they dont get enough credit they dont get enough credit theyre amazing people so lets get back to repealing the defense sequester right now it doesnt sound that exciting but its very important because were going to rebuild our badly depleted military  that means brand new modern aircraft for naval air station and you know what im talking  fallon whos fallon any  not far from here the naval air station we have aircraft thats  and  years old we have aircraft much older than that we cant even buy parts to some of our aircraft theyre so old they dont make the parts anymore im honored to have the endorsement of more than  top admirals and generals and  medal of honor recipients  now see those medal of honor recipients when they saw that scene over there they would have brushed off the secret service and they would have jumped in  theyre incredible people but we have now many many more coming also to endorse the whole  the whole campaign its been a beautiful thing hillary clinton brought death  i love you too  and disaster  and i want to thank all of these people wow you were amazing thank you fellas i saw what you are doing thats a tough group of people right here thank you  thank you its really great i saw that that was pretty amazing nobody messes with our people right nobody  she brought death and disaster to iraq and syria and libya and she empowered iran and she unleashed isis across the world she created a vacuum and isis was formed now she is saying shes going to get rid of it she has no chance of getting rid of isis we are going to get  we get rid of it fast and when we go in to do something we dont announce it four months before we do it like mosul we dont announce that were going into mosul to get the leaders who leave about two minutes after they hear the first announcement now were going to do things right folks hillary and her failed establishment have spent  trillion on wars in the middle east and now the middle east is in worse shape than its ever been by a factor of  they have dragged us into foreign wars that make us less safe they shipped our jobs and wealth to other countries and theyve left our borders wide open at home we send our troops to foreign countries to defend their borders but our politicians refuse to defend our borders figure that one out  that will change on november th  a trump administration will never ever put the interest of a foreign country before the interest of our country  from now on its going to be america first  to all americans i say its time for change its time for real leadership well have real leadership  just in finishing up i want you to think about what we can accomplish in the first  days of the trump administration we are going to have the biggest tax cut since ronald reagan  and she is going to raise your taxes substantially we will eliminate every unnecessary jobkilling regulation  we will cancel every illegal obama executive order  we will protect religious liberty  have to do it  rebuild our military and we are going to take care for once and for all of our great great veterans  for once and for all theyve been treated very badly we will provide school choice and put an end to common core were bringing education local  and support the great men and women of law enforcement  great people amazing people were going to save our second amendment which is under siege  so important we have the nra total endorsement earliest endorsement they have ever given and appoint justices to the supreme court of the united states who will uphold and defend the constitution of the united states  its time to cut our ties with the failed politicians of the past hillary clinton is the candidate of yesterday folks shes been doing this for  years and its only bad we are the movement of the future  were fighting for every parent who lost their child to drugs and crime and gang  right right and gang violence so much gang violence were fighting for every community whose jobs and dreams have been ripped out and shipped to other countries no more no more no more and were fighting for every american who believes government should serve the people not the donors and not the special interests  im asking you to dream big because with your vote we are just  can you believe this three days away from the change  youve been waiting for your entire life amazing youre going to remember this day and youre going to remember this evening and youre going to remember the vote that you cast whether youve casted or whether you will be casting it and youre going to say it was the single greatest vote you ever have cast because thats when your country started winning again  were going to win with trade were going to win on the border were going to win the war on drugs were going to knock the hell out of isis  we have no choice were going to win so much youre going to get tired of winning youre going to say you know this guy is winning too much because youre not used to winning because we never win we dont win with war we dont win with trade we dont win on the borders youre going to win so much youre going to love it get out and vote get out and vote because together we will make america wealthy again  we will make america strong again  we will make america

111,"Trump","thank you very much thank you special place special people thank you so we really werent supposed to be here we werent going to come back to iowa they said mr trump you dont have to youre leading by so much you dont have to i said what do you mean i dont have to i want to go to iowa which is true i want to go to iowa and the incredible leadership that you have in this state unbelievable so i just want to begin by thanking iowa leaders here today lieutenant governor kim reynolds where is kim come on up kim come on come on kim a man that ive gotten to know very well over the years and somebody thats respected outside of iowa like you wouldnt believe inside of iowa so much that hes the longest serving governor in the history of the united states terry branstad by the way terry came to my office and he was talking to me about trade i think theres nobody that knows more about trade than him hes one of the ones in dealing with china where you would be our prime candidate to take care of china he has done so well so well for the people of iowa nobody knows it better congressman steve king great guy great guy i even like him when he was endorsing ted he was endorsing ted and i still liked him so steve he came around it took him a little while but he came around thank you very much steve and a woman who i got to know because as you know she was on a very short list and she loves the people of iowa and she felt she needed a little it wasnt me it wasnt me she felt she needed a little more seasoning maybe and i said isnt that refreshing when you hear that from somebody and she is now seasoned because theres nobody that does a better job representing their people than joni ernst and a great person joni come on up thank you very much incredible people whenever they run just keep voting you have to always vote for them if its in two years or four years or  years youre never going to do better than them in two days can you believe this we are going to win the great state of iowa and we are going to win back the white house and i want to thank the people of iowa you have opened up your hearts to me so much incredible its been just incredible our evening here the other night with the fireworks everything is always beautiful in iowa real change begins with immediately repealing and replacing obamacare a disaster right theyre all saying yes please its just been announced that the residents of iowa are going to have and experience a massive double digit premium hike like i know the number i will not tell you i never do this with any of the groups i dont say the number because its so depressing right now everyone is happy were having a good time even though the subject matter is difficult but were going to make it great but i will say this the obamacare is out of control in the great state of arizona premiums are going up more than  i just left arizona and they are very unhappy with whats going on over half of the counties in iowa are losing obamacare insurers next year tough to negotiate its honestly not going to matter because were going to have it terminated by then so we win well have it terminated so we wont have any problems governor ok well terminate it itll be gone itll be just a bad memory premiums are surging companies are leaving insurers are fleeing doctors are quitting and deductibles are going through the roof you have deductibles at    can you believe it yet hillary clinton wants to double down on obamacare making it even more expensive far more expensive im asking for your vote so we can repeal and replace obamacare and save health care for every family in iowa and for every family in our great country so important just remember obamacare got to get rid of it real change means restoring honesty to our government there is little doubt that fbi director comey and the great special agents within the fbi will be able to collect more than enough evidence to garner indictments against hillary clinton and her inner circle despite her effort to disparage and discredit the fbi if she were to win it would create an unprecedented constitutional crisis in that situation we could very well have a sitting president under felony indictment and ultimately a criminal trial just today we learned hillary clinton was sending highly classified information through her maid did you see it just came out a little while ago who therefore had total access to this information completely jeopardizing the national security of the united states this just came out wiki leaks we need a government that can go to work on day one for the american people that will be impossible with hillary clinton the prime suspect in a farreaching criminal investigation her current scandals and controversies will continue throughout her presidency and will make it virtually impossible for her to govern lets hope we dont have to think about it if she ever got into the oval office hillary and her special interests would rob our country blind thats what she has been doing at the heart of this election is a simple question will our country be governed by the people or will it be governed by the corrupt political class were going to find out very soon if we win the corrupt politicians and their special interests lose if we win the american people and you understand that if we win whats going to happen to the american people if we win youre going to be so happy because if we win our country is going to start winning again we dont win anymore our country is going to start winning again its just that simple speaking in a secret wall street meeting hillary clinton admitted that she wants to cut medicare and social security hillary clinton is going to destroy your social security and medicare she even wants to give your benefits to illegal immigrants and youve seen that all over i am going to protect and save your social security and your medicare you made a deal a long time ago a long time ago and i will protect american workers the political and media elite have no idea what its like to be living on a paycheck paychecktopaycheck basis not knowing whether or not the owners and leaders of their company are negotiating to move their plant or factory to mexico or some other country and fire them sometimes with virtually no notice its happening all over the country its not going to happen with us folks not going to happen with us politicians dont understand what thats like the media and the political elite dont know the pain and the suffering these people are living under but i figured it out a long time ago and thats why im here im with you rather than where i was i was on the other side i was on the other side i understand it well i understand the other side well i was enjoying my life for many years on the other side but i also love our country and i will tell you our country was going bad our country was going not only in the wrong direction our country was going bad and on june th of last year i went from being a true insider to perhaps the ultimate outside ever ever i dont know i think so right what do you think kim i think so pretty much huh these people that ive known all my life theyre saying donald what happened we are going to make america great again  thats what happened you are the people that built our country and we are going to give you the respect that you deserve hillary is an insider fighting only for herself and her special interests im an outsider ive become an outsider fighting for you im not a politician you the american people are my only special interest thats what im doing it for thats what im doing it for and its a lot of work folks i will tell you its a lot more work than i ever thought but it is a movement in this country the likes of which our country has ever seen even the extremely dishonest media back there they will say there is no there has never been anything like this this is far bigger than bernie sanders that was a smarand by the way many of his people believe it or not are coming to our side because they agree with me on trade they realize how were being ripped apart on trade and he shouldve never made a deal he told his soul to the devil when he made that deal he ruined his legacy but many of the bernie people are coming over to us because of trade and our stance on trade is tougher and smarter and better than his but they understand that and theyre coming over the media wall street and the politicians are trying to stop us because they know we will fix the rigged system that has enriched them for so many years but very much at your expense very very much ive spent a life in business creating tens of thousands of jobs i built a great great company but ive spent a whole life ive employed tens of thousands of americans but when i saw what was happening to our country i just felt i had to act i had to act and i acted i acted so thats when i made my move and thats the way the move is thats when we made our move thank you very much june th famous day right do you remember coming down the escalators oh boy but i dont mind being an insider i dont mind this is our last chance folks i think the governor would agree with me so much we have one chance its our last chance its on tuesday its the th its our last chance now some of you have voted how many of you have voted its not soactually i like it because our numbers are looking very good but i know were going to get a lot more people tuesday is going to be a very good day but thisthis is our last chance because and im talking as a country because its never going to happen again and i was sort of saying it last time but his time i say it and we have so many things to do and we can do them some of them easily some of it is common sense theres no common sense the iran deal  billion going back to iran and then were going to give them  million in cash right but the  million turned out to be  billion terry is looking at me saying thats not possible  billion  billion we could use that and we could do a hell of a job in iowa with  thats interry thats in green thats cash that would go up to the ceiling  billion in cash and obama lied he said it wasnt for hostages but they wouldnt let the hostages go until the money came in so many lied lied on obamacare you can have your doctor you can have your plan  different times you can have your doctor you can have your plan many democrats who didnt want to approve it approved it based on that lie because it just made it unfortunately it just made it but going out and voting its your last chance its your last chance to make our country truly truly truly great again we have such potential my contract with the american voter begins with a plan to end government corruption and to take back our country from the special interests i want the entire corrupt washington establishment other than our great congressman over here hes not corrupt wheres our congressman im not talking about you congressman and im not talking about everybody but boy there are a lot of them to hear words we are all about to say when we win on november th we are going to drain the swamp that was an expression i tell people i thought it was hokey i thought that was so hokey i said no way im ever saying that and then i went before a big group like this and by the way this room is packed and there are thousands of people outside that cant get in which is amazing but i gave that expression at a speech and i go like very timidly drain the swamp the place like really liked it then i said it with more energy the next time and they really liked it and then a third time they really reallyand then now people are going crazy and theyre screaming at me when im speaking drain the swamp drain it between that and build the wall these are two expressions right and we will build a wall so you never know about things right i tell the story of frank sinatra frank sinatra didnt like my way the song my way great song he didnt like it and then he sang it the audience loved it he sang it again the audience really loved it then it went out and became the number one song all of the sudden he loved it right he loved it it became his favorite song just about at the core of my contract is my plan to bring jobs back to our country and to iowa were going to bring our jobs back our economys growth is anemic the worst since the great depression you dont hear that my jobs plan begins with a proposal to lower taxes on american business from  to  and thats a massive tax cut for the family farms and the folks in iowa that work so hard and end up with very little left after taxes and were going to further protect our family farmers were going to protect them like they have never been protected before i mean honestly or i would have one big enemy in terry that i can tell you and were going to protect cornbased ethanol hillary clintons plan will shut down family farms all over the nation just like closed up the mines well let me tell you the miners are going back to work and the steel workers are going back to work were going to have clean coal but miners are going back to work she will do this not only through radical epa regulation but also by raising taxes to rates as high as almost  hillary also wants to substantially increase the death tax on family farms you know you have a farm it would be nice to leave it to your children right its tough tough were going to get rid of that on top of that her antienergy agenda will radically up drive up the costs of energy another attack on agriculture big big attack on agriculture we will reverse the obamaclinton epa intrusion and eliminate jobkilling regulations that hurt the people of iowa and really hurt the farms you know the one thing and i was telling the governor your governor the last time were giving massivewere the highesttaxed nation in the world and were giving massive tax cuts but were also cutting very substantially the regulations and we want clean air we want clean water and we want safety but beyond that but i was just saying we areyou know you look at all of the different things the thing that they most want people are the cut in regulations even more important to them more important than the massive tax cuts are the cuts in regulations because they have killed our businesses theyre killing our businesses especially our small businesses and i wouldve been surprised and i was surprised audio cuts out joined in progresssyrian refugees pouring into our country and thats over the thousands and thousands that obama has allowed you know he should go to the oval office and he should work on jobs he should work on knocking the hell out of isis rich nation once again but to be a rich nation hillary clinton wants a  audio cuts out to keep radical islamic terrorists the hell out of our country we have no choice we have enough problems and we all have heart and were going to build safe zones in syria and were going to have the gulf states we owe  trillion in case youre not sure about it we have lots of problems but we will have the gulf states who have tremendous money tremendous and they havent been carrying their weight they havent done much havent accepted any were going to have the gulf states theyll be happy to do it theyre going to pay for it but were going to build safe zones but we cant have them come into our country too much uncertainty we justwe have enough problems wouldnt you say we have enough problems so well take care of it a trump administration will also secure and defend the borders of the united states and yes we will build a great wall were going to keep the drugs out were going to keep the poison out of our country thats destroying our youth and plenty of other people as secretary of state hillary clinton allowed thousands and thousands of the most dangerous and violent criminal aliens to go free because their home countries would not under any circumstances take them back can you imagine that they catch murderers drug dealers the worst people they bring them back and their country says were not taking them they go through the secretary of state she said bring them back and the crime thats been committed by these people is unbelievable i promise you this there wont be one instance not one where when we bring somebody back to their country where they belong where that plane comes back with that person sitting on that plane there wont be one instance there wont be one instance itll never happen its truly called a lack of respect for our country hillary supports totally opened borders there goes your country and strongly supports sanctuary cities like san francisco where kate steinle was murdered by an illegal immigrant who was deported at least five times thousands of americans would be alive today if not for the open border policies of obama and clinton this includes incredible americans like yearold sarah root who you know about who youve ready it who was right from iowa right from here incredible person ive spent time with her incredible family beautiful family devastated the illegal immigrant who killed sarah arrived at the border entered federal custody and then was released into the community despite the pleas of people that knew him please dont do this dont do this right under the policies of the white house he was released again and again but then he killed sarah in a savage savage way sarah graduated from college with a  grade index number one in her class the day before she was killed there are so many instances like this so many instances like this and people knew trouble but the administration said we dont get involved a trump administration will end this nightmare of violence thats going on all over our country we will stop illegal immigration deport all criminal aliens and dismantle every last criminal gang and cartel threatening our citizens and were going to build that wall its going to be a great wall and let me just tell you mexico is going to pay for the wall they dont know it yet they dont know it yet theyre starting to have a very good idea but thats ok you know mexico theyre great i met with the president of mexico three months ago great but its got to be a two lane highway you know we lose so much we lose our plants we lose our jobs we lose our wealth and we get drugs and unemployment its got to be a two way and it will be because the trade deficit with china and so many of these countries but the trade deficit with mexico is massive far greater than what were talking about for the wall so a lot of politicians said you cant get mexico to pay for the wall i said its going to be so easy its going to be so easy but heres what you have to

grahams granddaughter was here and spoke incredibly i hear i hear  but cissie graham lynch is here someplace wheres cissie where is she you were so great everybodys saying if you can do as well as cissie youve done a good job so thank you  that is an amazing  i will tell you my father used to take me they called it the crusades and that was the crusades it was a beautiful thing but billy graham was amazing i think  is he  today  years old billy graham  thank you cissie really great say hello to your family billy graham is  years old this is an amazing  truly one of the great great man our failed political establishment has delivered nothing but poverty at home and disaster overseas they get rich making america poor its time to reject a media and political elite thats bled our country dry  its finally time for us to fight for america were going to fight for america    im not a politician my only special interest is you  you know i built a great company  one of the great companies  one of the great real estate companies some of the most incredible assets in the world including doral right down the road and lots of other things buildings on the beach with the dezer family and with related weve had a tremendous career but  and i was on the other side you know my whole life i was always watching watching i was on the other side its very nice and very comfortable to be on the other side but i love this country  and this country was going bad it was going bad  so i went like from sort of an ultimate insider  i mean people that absolutely  senators theyd call don how are you you know theyd come over every year id give them a check for some crazy thing theyre doing and theyd say donald how are you how are you the day i announced it was like donald who we dont know  we dont know donald trump  you have to see these guys oh i know im better than anybody it was time it  was time i had to join the other side which is you we are going to do things so special  our country was in trouble our country was in trouble  trillion in debt making deals like the deal with iran where we give them  billion  where we give them  billion in cash you know what that is thatd fill up this side of the arena nobody ever even heard of things like this when you look at our military is allowed to deplete  our militarys very depleted we cant do that this is among the times where we most need a tremendous and powerful and smart military we need smart people  and obamacare is a disaster everythings wrong  our country doesnt win anymore were going to start winning again ok  real change begins with immediately repealing and replacing obamacare  its just been announced that the residence of florida  sorry to tell you this folks i dont wanna  i dont wanna make you depressed you know half of you are gonna walk out of the room but dont do that  are going to experience massive double digit premium hikes ok and theyre far greater than what youve been told youve been told numbers because they didnt wanna do it before the election i worked very hard to force those numbers out its gonna have a great impact on  you know my poll numbers are going through the roof you know why i really believe a big part of it is obamacare because were gonna repeal it and replace it  in the great state of arizona premiums are going up more than  percent over  percent of the counties in florida are losing obamacare and theyre losing the insurers that put obamacare there but you know what were gonna make it  percent of the counties because were gonna terminate obamacare and its not going to make a difference  well be terminating obamacare and well be replacing it with so many different options but youll have great health care at a fraction  a fraction of the cost and itll be great  with obamacare premiums are surging companies are leaving insurers are fleeing doctors are quitting and deductibles are going through the roof yet crooked hillary clinton wants to double down on obamacare making it even more expensive gonna go way up gonna go way up obamacare is going much higher   nobody in this room can believe whats going on in washington nobody in this room can believe whats going on with the fbi and whats going on with the department of justice nobody nobody can  nobody can believe it im asking for your vote so we can repeal and replace obamacare and save health care for every family in florida and in our great country  real change also means restoring honesty to our government hillary clinton is the most corrupt person ever to seek the office of the presidency of the united states she threatened national security she sold her office to the highest bidder and then to cover her tracks she deleted at least  emails after receiving a congressional subpoena  hillary clinton is being protected by a totally rigged system and now its up to the american people to deliver justice at the ballot box tomorrow thats whats gonna happen  thats whats gonna happen  my contract with the american voter begins with a plan to end government corruption and take back our country and to take it back swiftly from the special interests who i know so well i want the entire corrupt washington establishment to hear the words we are all about to say when we win tomorrow we are going to drain the swamp   you know the other day you read where hillary clinton called entertainers because she cant get anybody  nobody wants to go i mean look i dont know i see shes doing fine im doing fine in the polls and all that stuff i dont know how nobody goes to her rallies so she got jayz and beyonce and the language they used was so bad the language  the language was so bad and as they were singing singing right  talking was it talking or singing i dont know but the language  the language was so bad that many of the people left by the time hillary got up there was nobody there  but the crooked media those people back there the most dishonest people  the crooked media does nothing they dont explain it they dont explain it and isnt it amazing that when jayz and beyonce use the filthy language that they use in the songs using words that if i ever said those words it would be the reinstitution of the electric chair right  its true its true they use these words and then she comes on and hugs them like everythings right and yet with me hes very lewd thats a new word you know lewd i mean ive never seen anything like it in my life she is such a phony she is such a phony  i will say this i dont think that billy graham ever spoke like this do we agree this is different than a billy graham crusade but you know what were all looking for the same thing were looking for greatness for our country were looking for religious liberty  looking for religious liberty  but we are somewhat different personalities look at this mask look at this mask wow thats beautiful look at that looks just like me  nice head of hair ill say that  thank you thank you is there any place more fun to be than a trump rally  at the core of my contract is my plan to bring back our jobs  florida has lost one in four of its manufacturing jobs since nafta a deal signed by bill clinton and supported by his lovely wife hillary  america has lost hard to believe this  factories since china entered the world trade organization another bill and hillarybacked disaster we are living through the greatest jobs theft in the history of our world look no country has ever lost jobs like us theyre sucked out of our country the companies leave they fire everybody they go to mexico and many other countries it never happened before like this and were going to stop it day one its so easy to stop its so easy  so easy to stop a trump administration will stop the jobs from leaving america and we will stop the jobs from leaving florida promise  if a company wants to fire their workers leave florida and move to another country like mexico as an example and then ship their products back into the united states through what will become an unbelievably strong border i will tell you   we will make them pay a  percent tax on those products  and ill tell you whats gonna happen ill tell you whats gonna happen nobodys gonna leave because the model no longer works you know ford is leaving i was in michigan last night ford is leaving theyre all leaving thats why im going to win michigan i believe were gonna win michigan  michigan theyve ripped  they have ripped cars out of there factories out of there plants out of there same thing ohio so many companies have gone to mexico and other countries and were going to win these states by tremendous amounts because people are tired of being ripped off thats whats happening theyre being ripped off theyre being led by politicians who frankly  you know i went to an ivy league school i was a good student all that stuff but some words are just like you cant duplicate them right were tired of being led by stupid people theyre stupid theyre stupid people  we will renegotiate nafta stand up to china and stop the job killing transpacific partnership which will be a disaster  hillary clinton said its the gold standard and shes right remember she lied in the debate she said she never said it i said you did say it she said  well it turned out she lied she did say it it was the gold standard i say she was right though its the gold standard for the other countries not for us so she was actually right she should have said that she would have stopped a lie she doesnt know what shes doing as part of our plan to bring back jobs we are going to lower taxes on american business from  percent to  percent  and we are going to massively cut taxes for the middle class who i call  who i call the forgotten people these are the forgotten men and women they built our country they built our country  hillary clinton wants to raise taxes wants to raise taxes oh i love those signs blacks for trump hold that sign up  im telling you blacks for trump you know one of the things theyre seeing in a couple of these states like florida african americans arent turning out and when they do there are a lot of them voting for trump this is very disturbing to the other side  theyre not turning out because they dont care about her shes got not a lot of inspiration she used a term called superpredator to define black youth right superpredator and theyre not turning out theyre not turning out and then theyre worried because when they do turn out im getting so many more than was anticipated  i think the same is going to be true with hispanics you know the cubans gave me the award the bay of pigs association  the bay of pigs association last week gave me the award man of the year the bay of pigs association and it was a great honor no were gonna do great with the africanamericans were gonna do great with the hispanics and the other side is starting to see it and they are not happy they are not happy  were gonna be one country were not gonna be a divided nation anymore were a divided nation we are a divided nation    thank you proud of our country we will also cancel billions and billions of dollars in global warming payments to the united nations where those payments disappear  and were gonna use all of that money to invest in the infrastructure and we could even say the environmental infrastructure of our country  and remember this remember this when it comes to environment because i receive many environmental awards you know people dont wanna talk about that thats ok but we need absolutely crystal clear and clean water  we need beautiful immaculate air and we need safety and we need safety we give billions and billions of dollars away you can imagine whos taking that money you can imagine we dont even know what happens to it and we  he goes hillary is taking it probably hey youre pretty smart probably probably she gets her piece and we will create jobs and opportunities for africanamericans and hispanic americans that have been failed so badly theyve been lied to theyve been cheated to by the democratic party they want their vote give us your vote thanks a lot see you in four years thats what happens  were gonna do our job for instance i met recently with the leaders in the puerto rican community a community thats  its a great community i know it well and theyre being crushed by high taxes regulations and failed education policies of hillary clinton and obama you know where obama is now not working on jobs not working on mosul where they gave him four months

we dont win anymore as a country were going to start winning again  they get rich by making america poorer in many cases its time to reject the media and political elite that has bled our country dry  and these are among the most dishonest people they dont give you the truth folks they dont give you the truth  they rarely give you the truth you know it and they know it thats the scary part they know it its time to fight for america im not a politician i can say proudly my only special interest is you its you  were going to bring back the jobs that have been stolen from you were going to bring back the wealth that has been taken from our country were going to bring back the miners and the factory workers and the steel workers were going to put them back to work  the economic policies of bill and hillary clinton have destroyed manufacturing in your state and throughout the entire country   the corrupt clintons gave us nafta chinas too horrible entry into the world trade organization one of the disasters the jobkilling deal with south korea that was a hillary clinton beauty and the transpacific partnership which will be a total disaster  that hillary clinton said this is the gold standard and you know what it is the gold  she lied she lied during the debate she said  hey by the way who won the debate did we win that debate  but she lied during the debate she lied during the debate she said its the gold standard and then she said she never said it dont worry about coal were bringing back coal sir hes holding up a couple of  clean coal clean coal right were going to do clean coal the miners the miners are going to be back not if hillary clinton gets in the miners i guess you got to start thinking about something else but the miners are going to be back clean coal clean coal you know thinking about it though also people the press doesnt talk about it donna brazile gets the questions through a debate   but then it turns out to be a number of debates  who cares about donna brazile shes turned out to be not what people thought she gets illegally  illegally she gets the questions to the debate she then takes those questions and gives them to crooked hillary clinton  now does crooked hillary report it does she say i shouldnt have these questions or these answers i think they gave them the answers also right no she doesnt they doesnt i wonder if she had  i wonder if she had the questions in my debates i dont think so because she didnt do that well i dont think so i dont think so but the years of betrayal will end and they will end and theyre going to end quickly theyre going to end as of the day we take office which is going to be very very soon  the theft of north carolina jobs will end youve taken in harder than most states real change begins with immediately repealing and replacing obamacare  sadly its just been announced that the residents of north carolina are going to experience massive doubledigit premium hikes ninetyfive   of

the highest bidder and then to cover her tracks   she needed   shes being protected by a totally rigged system  general james cartwright  nothing happened a fourstar general three weeks ago  a totally

what we have to show in light of whats going on with justice in this country i really do i think its a great way you show it tomorrow we show it tomorrow my contract with the american voter begins with a plan to end government corruption and to take our country back from the special interests  and folks i was on the other side for a long time its a very good place to be but i love the country i love this country ive really gotten to love the people of this country because i have been everywhere we have the greatest people on earth but i love this country and i couldnt watch it when they made the iran deal they gave them  billion a terrorist state  a state that was ready to collapse until we made them rich and powerful we gave them a path to nuclear weapons they were ready to collapse we gave them remember  billion right we gave them  million then we found out that was  it wasnt  million it was  billion in cash in cash do you know what  billion in cash is you could take that whole side of the arena and you wouldnt have enough room how stupid are we to allow this to happen our leaders are incompetent president obama is campaigning today with hillary clinton because she cant campaign  she cant campaign  so obama is taking air force one which costs a fortune you know hes very much into the environment and hell take a massive old engine  very much into the environment very much into the ozone layer and yet hell fly that  all over the place to campaign for crooked hillary and i dont think its going to work and shes not getting any crowds so she gets beyonce and jayz i like them  i like them  and you know what they do i get bigger crowds than they do  its true i get far bigger crowds  look at this place i mean look at the crowds we had in michigan by the way michigan is in play it hasnt been in play for republicans for  something years michigan is in play because theyre tired of watching their car factories be taken out theyre tired of losing their jobs to mexico ford ford right now moved all of its small car production to mexico theyre building the biggest plants in the world in mexico and michigan  complaining about it for five years to michigan  no were going to have some  tomorrows going to be a very historic day i really believe that i think its going to show  i think its going to be a brexit plus plus plus does that make sense  plus plus plus  it will be amazing it will be amazing i want the entire corrupt washington establishment to hear the words were all about to say this is a phrase i told you i didnt like it i thought it was hokie but its not hokie its called drain the swamp   were going to go to washington were going to drain the swamp cant believe it i told the story i hated that expression i said no way im going to say that no way thats so hokie and i said it the place went crazy then i said it to another place it went crazier then i said it with more confidence because you know confidence is  and it went wild now i love the expression i think it was genius   drain the swamp drain the swamp    is there any place better to be than a trump rally are we having fun  are we having fun no and i dont have a guitar and i dont have a piano all we have is great concepts for our country which is the most important thing because frankly when people get on stage and theyre entertainers and they entertain in order to get people to fill up a room for hillary clinton and by the way they use the dirtiest language the other night and it was  many of the people left you know theyre political people they heard words theyve never heard before they left so the place was half empty by the time  actually it never got full even with them then it was pretty much empty midway through and then most of the people just left and when hillary got up there was practically  she might as well just have started with a few people it wouldve been easier  but you know she hears those words i wont use the words i wont even address the words because if i do the crooked media will say did you hear what donald trump said today  but honestly  yes  those words were disgusting if i ever said those words that jayz said or that beyonce said the other night you know what would happen to me the reinstitution of the electric chair it would be  how about if i got the answers to the debate or if i got the questions supposing instead of hillary getting the questions to the debate which is cheating shes a cheat she is a cheat she never reported it she is a cheat so supposing instead of her  supposing somebody gave donald trump the questions to the debate headlines all over the world he must withdraw from the race you dont even hear anything about crooked hillary she got the questions to me thats such a big difference some people say my people oh dont mention that its just  i say to me its a big deal   its a big deal but its not a big deal for the dishonest media to say they dont want to report it but just think about it supposing it was us at the core of my contract is my plan to bring back our jobs bring them back to america  and by the way you have a great governor support your governor hes a great guy  where is he hes here someplace hes a great guy and hes in a tough fight and hes going to win that fight but hes a great guy so hopefully youll support your governor north carolina has lost nearly half of its manufacturing jobs since nafta a deal signed by bill clinton and his lovely wife hillary  well think of it think of it think of the numbers of jobs heres the one that gets me the most two things get me the most two things that just dont seem real because were going to take care of our veterans right like big league because our veterans are great but two statistics i cant believe twentytwo suicides a day for our veterans   think of it you wouldnt think thats possible because theyre treated so badly they wait on line for six seven eight days for simple procedure that could solve their problem or for a prescription but two numbers i dont  it just doesnt make sense twenty two suicides a day for our veterans ok it doesnt make sense and heres another one america has lost  factories now i thought they meant  or  maybe its  factories since china entered the world trade organization another bill and hillary clintonbacked disaster think of it though  think of what  factories is so those are the two numbers they just dont seem to be real sad numbers sad numbers especially the vets to be honest with you were living through the greatest jobs theft in the history of our world theres never been anything happened to a country like has been happening to the united states our jobs are fleeing our companies are being taken and leaving and leaving a trump administration will stop the jobs from leaving america and we will stop the jobs from leaving north carolina believe me  if a company wants to fire their workers and leave as an example north carolina and move to another country and then ship their products back into the united states through what will be a very strong border by the way   we will make them pay a  percent tax on every product that they ship back here  and heres whats going to happen theyre not going to leave theyre not going to leave now your politicians some of them dont understand it  only cut taxes for the middle class and by the way hillary clinton wants to raise your taxes and you know that  substantially so one of the highest taxes in the world she wants to raise your taxes same old story we will unleash the power of american energy including shale oil natural gas and clean coal our plan will end the epa intrusion into your family farms and stop double taxation of a family farm at that  we will cancel billions in global warming payments to the united nations billions and billions of dollars and we have no idea what they do with that money i actually have a pretty good idea youre not going to like it and use that  were going to use that money to rebuild the infrastructure of our country  and we will rebuild our inner cities the africanamerican community the hispanic community   have had such lies told to them they live  many many people living in the inner cities of our country theyre getting worse and worse the crime is unbelievable you cant walk to the store and get a loaf of bread often you get shot chicago thousands and thousands of shootings since jan  you read it the murder rate of the united states is the highest its been in  years the dishonest media doesnt tell you that stuff because they want you to like obama they want you to think obama is doing a good job and hes not  and hes not  and hes not  so you live in the inner cities youre africanamerican youre hispanic the schools are no good there are no jobs and its totally unsafe and i say i will fix it what the hell do you have to lose im going to fix it  we are all going to fix it  were going to fix it were going to bring back jobs were going to bring back safety and were going to get really good education going  tremendous potential folks in the inner cities believe me tremendous potential we will become a rich nation again but to be a rich nation we must also be a safe nation hillary clinton wants a  percent increase in syrian refugees flowing into our country  unbelievable its unbelievable  her plan will import generations of terrorism extremism and radicalism into your schools and throughout your communities and you dont even know where theyre going your government doesnt even know where theyre going when im elected president we will suspend the syrian refugee program   and we will keep radical islamic terrorists the hell out of our country  have no choice  we have no choice   we have no choice but were going to work because we all have hearts and its a big problem caused to a large extent by obama and hillary clinton the migration caused to a large extent  isis was caused by them they left a big vacuum there was no isis when she first served as secretary there was no isis she created it now she stands at the debate i will fight isis shes got no chance shes going to fight nobody she wants to go home and go to sleep  unbelievable shes going to fight isis so were going to build  were going to build we are going to build safe havens were going to have the gulf states who have nothing but money theyre going to pay for it we have  trillion in debt and if its ok im not going to spend  we have  trillion in debt and we still have to rebuild our country you know its one thing like when you buy a company and its got some debt we have  trillion in debt but the countrys a mess the roads are bad the bridges are bad the schools are bad the hospitals are bad the tunnels are bad everythings bad the military needs massive amounts of money so we have all this horrible debt its one thing if we had it and everythings in tippy top shape i like to say you know i like the properties give me them i want them give me them but we have them and theyre a mess and we have  trillion which is far too much so were going to get it down and were going to rebuild our  we have so many things were going to be doing were going to be a rich nation again  a trump administration will also secure and defend the borders of the united states  and yes we will build a great wall and mexico will pay for the wall  percent  one hundred percent  mexico will pay if you look at the incredible  if you look at the incredible deficits we have with mexico its unbelievable what we have the cost of that wall is peanuts is peanuts compared to the numbers youre talking about on trade with mexico and the numbers with china trade deficit i mean we will have a trade deficit with china of close to  billion this year we are going to lose in worldwide trade of goods were going to lose worldwide close to  billion what are we doing you really ask who is negotiating these deals where do these people come you know where they come from theyre political hacks youre dealing with the smartest people in the world you have chinese people every  you have from japan you have from all these other countries they put their smartest and the best we put political hacks that dont know what theyre doing so we have an  and we have the greatest in the world we have the greatest business people we have the greatest negotiators we dont use them we dont use them we use political people some of them got their job because they give campaign contributions  were going to get it straightened out folks starting tomorrow go vote go vote  right my women hillary supports totally open borders there goes your country and strongly supports sanctuary cities like san francisco where kate steinle was murdered violently by an illegal immigrant deported at least five times we will cancel all federal funding to sanctuary cities  we will stop illegal immigration deport all criminal aliens and dismantle every last criminal gang and cartel threatening our citizens  we will also repeal the obamaclinton defense sequester and rebuild our badly depleted military  there have been few times in our history where weve needed it more few times north carolina will be at the very center of this effort with brand new advanced fighters flying from seymour johnson air force base  beautiful beautiful beautiful beautiful new fighters from seymour johnson and were going to have more battalions you know the marines are way way off in terms of numbers you know that i know has there ever been yes there have been but rarely do we have times when we need this strong presence like now the world hates us the world hates us so were going to increase  thank you were going to increase marine battalions at camp lejeune ive been to camp lejeune  they make major new investments where i was the other night right next to it i guess like  or  people at fort bragg  great people all soldiers are tough a couple of them shook my hand it was like oy whoa take it easy fellas they are tough cookies they are strong they dont know how strong they are these are great people and new military technologies will be researched and developed right here at the research triangle right here  im honored to have the endorsements of more than  top admirals and generals and  medal of honor recipients and every day those numbers go up big league big league and i asked some of the generals and admirals the other night by fort bragg i asked them i said fellas let me ask you a question they want to take over mosul am i getting something wrong whatever happened to the element of surprise for us im talking to admirals now and generals thats what they do i do other things but you know its called like common sense you got to say weve made a lot of right calls i said why is it that four months away from going into mosul theyre announcing we are going into mosul were going into mosul because we want to get the leaders of isis and theyre staying in mosul and then three months theyre saying we are going in in three months to mosul and then were going in in two months and every time i hear i put my hands i go like this i dont want to hear this please and as you know theyve been met with tremendous resistance much more than they wouldve been and i guarantee you this i cant say it with certainty only about  percent ok i cant say  nothings  percent even our victory isnt  percent but its starting to look pretty close isnt it  those numbers those numbers  oh these guys are unhappy look at them theyre not happy they are unhappy campers starting to look good  starting to look good but wouldnt it be nice if instead of announcing four months ago and there months ago then they have last  two weeks ago they go next week were getting ready to raid the leaders all left theyre gone and the other people are putting up much more of a fight horrible theyre using human shields its a horrible situation i mean its hell its hell but why do we  watch whats going on hillary and her failed establishment have trillion dollars on wars in the middle east that we never win we just keep fighting and fighting its like a hose the money just keeps pouring out we never win and now the middle east is in worse shape by far than its ever been we have the great migration the whole thing theyve dragged  thank you  i dont even want to look ill get myself i dont want to look  theyll make it  i wont even say i love you too because theyre going to make it a major headline if i said that worlds most dishonest people the worlds really dishonest people  they dragged us into foreign wars that have made us less safe shipped our jobs and wealth all over  right open at home you ever notice we send these incredible troops so much death so much injury in order to create a border for a country that most people have never even heard of and yet we dont protect our own borders isnt it an incredible thing that will change starting tomorrow  because from now on its going to be america first america first  so just in summing up to all americans i say its time for a real leadership and time for change we have to have change  can you imagine having hillary for four years  im being serious about that i wouldnt want to watch the news every night i mean look at what shes done with the emails as an example i mean did you ever see a mess like this did you ever see  of course the fbi  the director was obviously under tremendous pressure so they went through  emails in eight days right so sad whats going on and she still deleted them after getting a subpoena from congress i mean thats a crime what happened thats a crime you dont even need the new stuff she shouldnt be allowed to run   shouldnt be allowed to run just think about what we can accomplish in the first  days of a trump administration  were going to have the biggest tax cuts since ronald reagan   and hillary is going to raise your taxes substantially were going to save and protect your social security and medicare  and hillary is going to cut your social security and really injure medicare thats whats going to happen we will eliminate every unnecessary jobkilling regulation well cancel every illegal obama executive order  by the way a man that loves this state its his birthday today billy graham   the father of franklin billy graham what a great one right ninetyeight years old he is a fantastic man franklins a fantastic man and its so wonderful to have support of people like that were going to protect  religious liberty   rebuild our military and take care of our great veterans were going to take care of our veterans  we will provide school choice and put an end to common core we move our education locally  we will support the men and women  these are great people the men and women of law enforcement  were going to save our second amendment  and appoint justices to the united states supreme court who will uphold and defend the constitution of the united states  this sounds so good to me because i started this on june th of last year because i couldnt stand when i looked at what was going on with our country i couldnt stand it i couldnt stand it coming down the escalator right with melania coming down that escalator june  of last year and they were all saying  there were all the dishonest pundits actually a few of them thought i had a hell of a chance if you want to know the  the smarter ones but they were all saying but hes not involved with  ive been involved with politics all my life on the other side but ive been involved we had  people  by the way one of the great people in here tonight mike huckabee where is mike huckabee  hes such  is he here someplace he is here he is so great mike wherever you are come on out because you are great i just saw him but we had  people of great talent ben carson endorsed us mike  mike endorsed us tremendous  i mean very talented people and one by one by one  and they used to say  well i remember we were down to like  or  in one state i got  percent and one of these clowns said he has not reached the  percent mark i got  percent with like  people how do you get  percent with  people and they said he hasnt reached the  percent mark theyre very dishonest people so we ended up with  people right dont forget thats hard because nobody else ever had a field that big or that violent or that violent and we have a couple that didnt endorse and thats too bad you know they signed a pledge they didnt honor it but  but  no but for the most part  no for the most part they were very honorable but it was rough they said it was the roughest primary every i would say this is the roughest election you know the nfl ratings are way down you know why because everyones watching this its actually tougher its actually tougher  everyones watching the nfl ratings are way down a lot of people say its because of this so you had  people youve came down  but weve got  and this is a tribute to everybody in this room we got the highest number of voters in the history of the republican primary system  so well done  thats a long time you know starting with honest abe lincoln right thats a long time i got more than honest abe thats really the only thing i did better than honest abe honest abe was pretty  he was pretty good  so heres the beauty you have one day until the election and its not even one day its a half a day to make every dream youve ever dreamed for your country and for your family to come true you have one magnificent chance and honestly in four years its over folks there has never been a movement like this even these dishonest people in the media say there has never  bill oreilly he said its the single greatest political phenomena that hes witnessed in his life thats a pretty good statement  but others have said it others have said it others have said it and its not going to happen again it wont be able to happen again four years itll never happen so you got to get out there and you got to vote got to get out   somebody said what youve done has never been done before it doesnt matter if you win or lose i said believe me it matters no they said that itll be down in the history books i said you know what you may be right about that but if we dont win i will consider this the single greatest waste of time energy wow do i  you need energy for this the single greatest waste of time energy and money i have over  million thats a lot of money that i dont take in from the special interests because i dont need it thats nice and we have the biggest internet  you know the small donors the small donors are giving us money at record clips i think we had  million and then we had close to  million and it comes in and i think the average was like  each i love those people those are people that love this country  and usually thats for the democrats you know in all fairness thats usually for the democrats to do that but were beating everybody nobodys seen anything like what were doing so we dont want to blow it we dont want to waste it go vote go vote because believe me if we dont win all of us honestly weve all wasted our time ill be honest because nothings going to happen they may say good things about us as a movement wont mean a damn thing folks you got to go out we got to vote and we got to win change  change so you have one magnificent chance to beat the corrupt system that youre witnessing today and to deliver justice for every forgotten man and woman and child in this nation do not let this opportunity slip away were fighting for every citizen who believes that government should serve the people not the donors and not the special interests  and were fighting were fighting to bring us all together as americans were a very divided country people dont realize we are an unbelievably divided country were going to come together just imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as one people under one god saluting one american flag  just imagine im asking you to dream big because with your vote we are just one day away from the change youve been waiting for for your entire life  because if we win tomorrow we will be able to make america wealthy again to make america strong again to make america safe again and to make america great again   god bless you everybody  thank you god bless you thank you north carolina  thank you folks thank you"

whether we are ruled by yourselves the people it is time to reject a failed political elite that has bled this country dry  to all the people of pennsylvania i say we are going to put the miners and the factory workers and the steel workers back to work were bringing our companies back  the trade policies of bill and hillary clinton have destroyed manufacturing in your state and throughout the country i want to take this moment to share a message with all of the democratic voters in our country thirsting  thirsting for change youre tired of a government that works only for wall street and the special interests youre tired of the reckless foreign policy the crazy wars that are never won hillary clinton is the last stand for the wall street and special interest donors and to special interests themselves and hillary is the face of failure  shes the face of failure shes the face of failed foreign policy  real change begins  she is indeed the face of failure look at what shes done with emails look at the mess  look at the mess and look at the corruption real change begins immediately with the repealing and replacing of the disaster known as obamacare  this is a great room we had great victories in this room by the way  great victories in this room  and i went to school in pennsylvania and my kids went to school in pennsylvania so i guess we assume its a good place to learn look have you been seeing the polls by the way   oh boy oh boy see the dishonest people back there the media the totally dishonest group  they are so dishonest   they are so dishonest folks you cant even read articles in certain papers anymore new york times is a total   were doing fantastically well in north carolina i think were leading we  i believe  are leading in florida  and now hillary just announced shes going to additional stops shes going to michigan traditionally not really a republican state but you know ive been talking i was man of the year in michigan a number of years ago and i started telling and talking about your car business is being stolen from you ive been saying it for years and years and years and you know what michigan now agrees were leading in michigan  were leading  and when i heard that crooked hillary is going there tonight she had to nobody thought in terms of michigan when i heard i figured you know what i have nothing to do tonight so ill go there tonight and give it the last word ok  so after this im going to new hampshire and then im going to michigan oh were going to have a great victory tomorrow folks were going to have a great victory  they have no idea  the dishonest media has no idea actually they do have an idea theyre saying what is going on and look at these people and look at this enthusiasm theres nothing like it by the way and just i have to say this is considered  the history of this country this is actually  and youve been hearing it this is considered the greatest movement nobodys ever seen anything like this folks  nobodys ever seen anything like  where we give  billion to iran where we give them  million in cash but that turns out to be  billion in cash to iran for hostages  for hostages which our president lied about and just one other thing why  he ought to be working on jobs on getting rid of isis on our borders on our healthcare which is failing so badly  boy oh boy and she cant get anybody to go to her rallies so she gets jayz  he uses the worst language i have ever heard and by the time hes finished whats happened what happens he and beyonce right theyre finished by that time most of the people have left so she thinks shes getting people by the time she speaks theyre all gone anyways she should just take a small room and talk  just take a small room and talk its just been announced that the residents of pennsylvania are going to experience a massive double digit premium hike so high that i wont tell you what it is its very high all  counties in pennsylvania most of which i won in the primaries right  almost all almost everyone of them are losing obamacare insurance next year that puts you in a bad position but the truth is its not going to matter because we are going to repeal it and replace it  not going to matter dont worry about it  so you can leave here happy premiums are surging companies are leaving insurers are fleeing doctors are quitting and deductibles are going through the roof yet crooked hillary clinton wants to double down on obamacare making it even more expensive than it is right now  im asking for your vote so we can repeal and replace obamacare and save healthcare for every family in pennsylvania  real change also means restoring honesty to our government  hillary clinton is the most corrupt person ever to seek the office of the presidency of the united states shes threatened national security  and then to cover her tracks she deleted  emails after receiving a congressional subpoena   she should not  shes being protected by a rigged system and part of the rigged system is the dishonest media believe me theyre rigging the system  true its true dont worry they never show the crowds folks they never  they show my face boom boom  never show the crowd it took over a year for the fbi to review  emails and then just eight days they reviewed  emails  so now its up to the american people to deliver justice at the ballot box tomorrow youve got to get out and vote  lets swamp them pennsylvania lets swamp them youve got to get out  our country has never ever done anything like theyre doing right now when it comes to justice james cartwright four star general two weeks ago admitted to one mistake and he did it on the basis of national security he said and i can understand that he may go to jail for up to five years general petraeuss life has been destroyed for doing one one hundredth of what hillary clinton did  so sad so sad its  honestly its a disgrace and now shes allowed to run for president and general cartwright will end up being in jail  my contract with the american voter begins with a plan to end government corruption and take back our country from the special interests and the donor  i want the entire corrupt washington establishment to hear the words from all of us when we win tomorrow we are going to washington dc to drain the swamp    they say were tied in pennsylvania i dont think so  i dont think so i think were going to blow them out tomorrow in a lot of different ways blow them out  no way this is not the sound of a second place finisher that i can tell you  no they have us tied dont forget we were  points down three weeks ago and then after the debates all of a sudden we started going up we started going up and it was great and now they have us even but i actually think were much better than that in pennsylvania i do  and so do you  get out there  contract is my plan to bring back our jobs  pennsylvania has lost almost  percent of its manufacturing jobs since nafta a deal signed by bill clinton and supported by his lovely wife hillary clinton  america has lost  factories since china entered the world trade organization another bill and hillary backed disaster  we are living through the greatest jobs theft in the history of the world a trump administration will stop the jobs from leaving america and we will stop the jobs finally from leaving pennsylvania   simply  and you havent heard this very simply if a company wants to fire their workers leave pennsylvania and move to  like mexico and then ship their products back into the united states we will make them pay a  percent tax on those products  and you know whats going to happen theyre not going to leave and if they do thats ok the country will make a lot of money but theyre not going to leave  theyre not going to leave now your politicians could have thought of that some of them some of them cant for they have other problems we will renegotiate nafta one of the worst deals probably the  not probably  the single worst trade deal ever made in the history of this world its true well stand up to china and stop the job killing transpacific partnership which hillary clinton wants you know she called it the gold standard and then she lied during the debate and she said i never said that i said yes you did you called it the gold standard turned out she was lying  turned out of course you could look at it differently it is the gold standard for the other side not for the united states for the other side its good how about this  how about this how about getting the questions for the debate  they fed her  illegally they fed her the questions for the debate donna brazile they fed her the questions to the debate and she never came and   they fed her the questions to the debate and she didnt say i cant do this im sorry its so unethical can you imagine if i was given the questions to the debate what would have happened the biggest story all over the  you dont even read this you read a little bit about donna brazile but you dont read this they gave her the questions to debates numerous debates against bernie sanders and bernie sanders he is really upset i would bet you he would wish that he didnt give her that little nod because he made a deal with the devil you know it he ruined the legacy  he really had a very important legacy going folks he ruined his legacy when he did that and hes got to be very embarrassed  hes got to be very very embarrassed as part of our plan to bring   percent to  percent  and we will massively cut taxes for the middle class the forgotten people  the forgotten men and women of this country who built our country we will massively lower taxes its in our plan and ill tell you hillary you see her plan she is going to raise taxes substantially folks  were the highest taxed nation in the world shes going to raise taxes figure that one out we will lift the restrictions on american energy  and ban shale  you folks

you everybody thank you very much   well you know we said we want to finish you off in new hampshire because of the incredible relationship i have but who would have expected this right who would have expected this  this is some group  so a couple of things two people i have a lot of respect for really like as people incredible people and because theyre so important to the area i thought i would give you this information theyve told me i can do it so i will do it tom brady    great guy great guy great guy great friend of mine great great champion unbelievable winner he called today and he said donald i support you youre my friend and i voted for you  and i want to tell you this guy is a champ and hes a winner and he is a great person so i said so tom you voted for me you support me am i allowed to say it tonight to this massive crowd in new hampshire he said if you want to say it you can say it ok  tom thats what a champion is all about and another person  very close to tom actually for a lot of reasons youll understand in a second i have unbelievable respect for him champion in every way and i was in the plane and they handed me a letter and it was from coach belichick  and he wrote me the most beautiful letter and it was only two hours ago so we called back we said do you think that mr trump could read that letter to the people of new hampshire  and he said absolutely if youd like he said but do me a favor dont read that letter let me send one thats a little bit different so i think that he was going to take all the good things out right like most gutless people do  gutless  but hes the opposite hes a champ so he sent me the new letter and it was much better it was stronger  see most people dont do that most people do the opposite i dont want to get involved this guy is a true champ so he writes coach belichick congratulations on a tremendous campaign you have dealt with an unbelievable slanted and negative media and have come out beautifully  beautifully  you proved to be the ultimate competitor and fighter your leadership is amazing i have always had tremendous respect for you but the toughness and perseverance you have displayed over the past year is remarkable hopefully tomorrows election results will give the opportunity to make america great again  best wishes for great results tomorrow bill belichick so i just want to   i just want to  it is funny though when he said i really want to redo the letter i really did expect to get a little bit  because i understand how most people work but most people arent the coach so tom brady and bill belichick i want to thank you both  and go win a good super bowl or whatever you want to do boy what a combination never been a better combination but when you know them personally like i do theyre even better  tomorrow we are going to win the great state of new hampshire   and we are going to take back the white house  we are going to deliver historic once in a lifetime change  when the people of this country from florida to minnesota from new mexico to right here in new hampshire step onto the voting booth tomorrow there is one fundamental question for you to consider  do you want america to be ruled by the corrupt political class or do you want america to be ruled again by the people    i am asking for the votes of all americans democrats republicans independent firsttime voters  and there are a lot of those firsttime voters folks  who are so desperately in need of change  can you imagine having hillary clinton for four years  can you imagine hillary clintons only allegiance is to herself her donors and her special interests  my only special interest is to you believe me is to you  thats why im doing this  thats why im doing this the corrupt special interest have stolen your jobs and shipped your wealth to other countries they betrayed the working class of this country tomorrow the american working class will strike back its about time  real change begins with immediately repealing and replacing obamacare  its just been announced that americans nationwide are going to experience a massive doubledigit and tripledigit premium hike over  percent of the counties in new hampshire are losing obamacare insurers next year lots of luck in your negotiation honestly folks not going to matter were going to have it terminated were going to have great health care at a fraction of the cost so its not going to matter  i want you to leave here happy tonight  premiums are surging companies are leaving insurers are fleeing doctors are quitting and deductibles are going through the roof yet hillary clinton wants to doubledown on obamacare making it even more expensive im asking for your vote so we can repeal and replace obamacare and save health care for every family in new hampshire and in our country  real change also means restoring honesty to government lets start by getting rid of clinton  thats the best   by the way did you ever see anything like happening right now have we ever seen anything like this  fourstar general james cartwright two weeks ago for a tiny tiny infraction by comparison can go to jail for up to five years and might very well general petraeus life was destroyed reputation totally destroyed for something that was a fraction of what hillary clinton did what a shame what a shame so sad hillary clinton is the most corrupt person ever to seek the office of the presidency of the united states  she threatened national security she sold her office to the highest bidder and then to cover he tracks she deleted  e mails after receiving a congressional subpoena  that in itself disqualifies her from running from president she shouldnt be allowed to run shes being protected by a totally rigged system  ive been saying it for a long time   drain the swamp hillary has shown contempt for the working people of this country her campaign in wikileaks has spoken horribly about catholics and evangelicals and so many others  they got it all down folks wikileaks  wikileaks and what podesta said about her bad instincts he said shes got bad instincts and bernie said to her  said bad judgment right so do we want a president with bad instincts and bad judgment   i dont think so were going to stand up for the catholics and were going to stand up for the evangelicals  wikileaks just released another debate question  hillary got another one just one hour ago i said i have to mention it you know if you go to west point or annapolis or the air force academy and if you get the questions to a test and if you dont report yourself they throw you out sad sad to me its one of the bad things a lot of my people they say lets not talk about that i should talk about it donna brazile got the questions donna brazile took those questions and gave them to crooked hillary right and crooked hillary didnt do anything she took the question and ill tell you what if i were bernie sanders i wouldnt be too happy and she probably did it with me too but did we win those debates or what  wouldnt matter  wouldnt matter so she got those questions she never turned them in folks remember youre dealing with a very dishonest person my contract with the american voter begins with a plan to end government corruption and to take our country back from the special interest  i want the entire corrupt washington establish to hear these words from all of us when we win tomorrow we are going to drain the swamp  that is something  that is something at the core of my contract is my plan to bring our jobs back  new hampshire has lost one in four of its manufacturing jobs since nafta a disaster a deal signed by bill clinton and supported by his lovely wife hillary  amazingly america has lost  listen to this   factories since china entered the world trade organization another bill and hillarybacked disaster  we are living through the single greatest jobs theft in the history of the world  theres never been anything like this a trump administration will stop the jobs from leaving america and we will stop the jobs from leaving new hampshire believe me  we will stop those jobs if a company wants to fire their workers leave new hampshire and move to another country and then ship their products back into the united states through what will soon be a very very strong and powerful border    we will make them pay a  percent tax on those products and you know whats going to happen you know whats going to happen theyre never leaving theyre staying  theyre staying we will renegotiate nafta stand up to china and stop the jobkilling transpacific partnership  as part of our plan to bring back jobs we are going to lower taxes on american business from  percent to  percent  we will massively cut taxes for the middle class hillary clinton is raising taxes very substantially  we will cancel billions in global warning payments to the united nations billions and billions and billions of dollars and nobody knows where it goes and nobody knows what its used for i know where it goes it goes into a lot of peoples pockets thats where it goes  and we will use that money to invest in environmental infrastructure in the united states of america if you dont mind right  and we will rebuild our inner cities and the africanamerican community and the hispanic community   will love whats going to happen because the inner cities in so many cases are like living in hell crime is rampant horrible you cant walk to a store without getting shot schools are terrible as bad as it gets and there are no jobs were going to bring back the jobs were going to fix the schools and make them terrific  and were going to make the inner city safe were going to make them safe and as you know the democrats for longer than  years in many cases unbroken chain have been incharge of the inner cities and you know what they want they want your vote then they say see you in four years folks they do nothing i will fix the inner cities and i ask you though what do you have to lose believe me we will do such a great job what do you have to lose and weve been doing very well if you look down in florida look at those long lines we have been doing very well with the africanamerican community and with the hispanic community   and all of the dishonest press theyre saying whats going on here whats going on among the worlds most dishonest people  look at all of them look at all those cameras  look at all of them look at all of those cameras why dont you twirl the cameras folks go ahead twirl them show the crowd  show the crowd they dont do it and outside you have another  who was just reported   these are the worlds bad people theyre dishonest people theyre very very dishonest  not all of them but i would say most of them you know you heard  you heard the coach he mentioned it too i guess hes got his difficulties with them also now theyre very dishonest i will be a champion for all americans against this unfair and corrupt system we will become a rich nation again  but to be a rich nation we must also be a safe nation hillary clinton wants a  percent increase in syrian refugees coming into the united states  cant do it folks  cant do it her plan will import generations of terrorism extremism and radicalism into your schools and throughout your communities when im elected president we will suspend the syrian refugee program    and we will keep radical islamic terrorist the hell out of our country believe me  a trump administration will also secure and defend the borders of the united states and yes we will build a great great wall    and dont forget new hampshire i promised you  i promised you when i won new hampshire in the primary i promised you i said we are going to stop the drugs from flowing in  were going to stop them from flowing in  were going to stop the drugs from poisoning your children and plenty of others were going to build a wall i was endorsed by so many people having to do with the borders the border patrol agents ice all endorsed donald trump such an honor for me because these are great people that want to do their job but i promised you that if i got this far you were the first ones and you were the first ones that really taught me how bad the drug epidemic is i met with your police  who are incredible people by the way  and they explained  and i guess it made a big impact on me because i love new hampshire i love the beauty of new hampshire  the trees the winding roads the lakes the rivers the whole thing the little streams so i meet with people and i say whats your biggest problem and theyd say heroin id say heroin it made such an impact because it just doesnt seem to work with the beauty of your area but i said we would stop it we will stop it  percent and then we are going to work on helping the people who are so seriously addicted ok  we are going to do it  hillary clinton totally supports open borders there goes your country  which means unlimited drugs pouring into your states pouring in to our country hillary also strongly supports sanctuary cities like san francisco   where kate steinle was murdered by an illegal immigrant and deported probably more than five times we will cancel all federal funding to sanctuary cities believe me  all of it we will stop illegal immigration stop the drugs from pouring into our country and dismantle every last criminal gang and cartel threatening our citizens  we will also repeal the obamaclinton defense sequester and re build our badly depleted military we needed so badly now  this will be national effort and a major part of this re building will be the portsmouth naval shipyard  its going to be a big part of it folks a big part we have now the smallest navy by the way  does anyone know this the smallest navy that weve had since world war i  were going to build it back up im honored to have the endorsement of more than  top admirals and generals and  medal of honor recipients and the list goes on and on and up and up every day  hillary and her failed establishment have dragged us into foreign wars that have made us less safe and that we never win  we never win we fight and fight and fight like mosul we give them four months notice were going into mosul what about the element of surprise remember the old element of surprise we are going to be attacking mosul in four months we will hit them from the rear we will hit them from the front we will paratroop in we will do all sorts of things then three months they say again then two months then one month and a couple of weeks ago im hearing we expect to be attacking mosul next week these are smart people one of the reasons were attacked is we want to get the leaders of isis who we feel are staying in mosul they left after the first mention that were going to attack dont these people understand it what a bunch of people we have  what a bunch of people i mean we got a president all he wants to do is campaign for crooked hillary thats all he wants to do  you know he takes that big  that big  air force one those big old engines that spew the stuff right and he flies it all over the place campaigning for hillary and then he talks about lets not affect the ozone layer what a joke  what a joke and he shouldnt be campaigning he should be out trying to get our jobs back trying to secure our borders building up our military stopping our drug problem  amazing amazing and hillary cant fill a room look at this is called filling a stadium and i have no guitar and no piano right i mean she gets jayz and beyonce the other night  the language right the language was so bad people were insulted they started walking out hillary then walks under the stage hugs them hugs them hugs them and then she says donald trump uses such foul language give me a break  did you hear what he was saying and tonight she has bruce springsteen what they dont say is this so they perform actually in the case of jayz they were leaving because some of these people never heard language like that they started to leave so what happens they come in listen to the musician which i think is demeaning to the  its actually demeaning to the political process they listen  because she cant fill a room if shed come her shed have  im telling you  shed have  people sitting on the first place were going to have  we have  people including the people outside   more than beyonce more than jayz more than anybody  and we dont have a guitar what we do have is we all have together a great plan to make america great again thats what we have  and also in all fairness is there any place better than a trump rally to be i mean really  theres no place better so these politicians have shipped our jobs and our wealth all over the world and left our borders wide open at home that will change immediately upon our victory believe me immediately  got to get out and vote tomorrow is the day got to get out  we got to get out and vote one thing ill say about new hampshire id never disappointed new hampshire but new hampshire has never disappointed me  remember in the primaries they said donald trump you know the phony polls these people  they said donald trump may not win new hampshire i said thats surprising i think im going to win  i think im going to win and then we won by  points   with a lot of people you know we have  people you know what else right next door in massachusetts where theyre represented  now i know why you like belichick so much and tom  tom brady by the way is there a better reference than tom brady and bill belichick who are  i dont know  i dont think so you know in massachusetts we had  what  people left they go like this boom boom boom i think we had  people left we got  andahalf percent of the vote and these dishonest pundits said donald trump has not broken  how do you break  when you have  people  but we won  we won massachusetts we got over  percent  and massachusetts is represented by pocahontas right pocahontas  represented by pocahontas oh shes terrible she is so  she is just a terrible person terrible you know clinton thinks she is doing herself a favor to use this woman as a surrogate everybody that watches her they say she is a terrible human being she is terrible  so i dont know whos going to challenge her but whoever does you know i hear a very great baseball pitcher is going to challenge her  hes a great  and you know what hes a great guy i dont know if hes going to do it but hes a great guy but elizabeth warren is terrible  and you know what shes a terrible  let me tell you shes a terrible senator take a look at what shes passed nothing nothing and in the senate everybody hates her they dont want to even deal with her so ill make you a deal you can have pocahontas ill take tom brady and bill belichick ok  and from now on its going to be america first  to all americans i say its time for change and time for leadership just think about what we can accomplish in the first  days of a trump administration were going to have the biggest tax cuts since ronald reagan even bigger and hillary is going to raise your taxes substantially were going to eliminate every unnecessary jobkilling regulation we will cancel every illegal obama executive order just  he goes out and plays golf so much that he doesnt have time to convince congress to go  lets do it the way its supposed to be done right right i mean hes played more golf than most people in the pga tour  this guy like is it over  rounds hey look its good golf is fine but always play with leaders of countries and people that can help us dont play with your friends all the time we are going to protect religious liberty   rebuild our military and we are going to finally take care of our veterans properly our veterans properly  our veterans have been very mistreated and i want to thank them for the tremendous support  and the military  the tremendous support i get they do polls and its like forget it its like im not running against anybody and our law enforcement has been so great  theyve been great were going to provide school choice and put an end to common core were bringing our education locally  and we will support the men and women of law enforcement great people   and save our second amendment which is under siege   and appoint justices to the united states supreme court who will uphold and defend the constitution of the united states  think of this i started on june th long time ago from way back can you imagine this and now i can say

116,"Trump","thank you very much thank you  thank you everybody wow thank you  thank you very much ladies and gentlemen so you know we added this stop about  minutes ago and look at this place is this incredible  and we dont need  we dont need jayz or beyonce we dont need jon bon jovi we dont need lady gaga all we need is great ideas to make america great again thats all we need  so its now officially tuesday november th  did you ever think youd be hearing a major speech like at around close to  oclock in the morning are we crazy is this crazy  its crazy  but you know we just left new hampshire where were doing fantastically well were up in new hampshire were up in ohio  were up in iowa were up in north carolina were doing great there  were up in florida  were doing really really well in pennsylvania i mean we are doing well these people the worlds most dishonest people the media they are not happy no no  theyre not happy theyre saying whats going on today were going to win the great state of michigan and we are going to win back the white house  were hours away from a onceinalifetime change were going to have real change not obama change i want to begin tonight by thanking all of you and all of the people in this incredible movement you know its a movement like has never happened in this country before its a movement that nobodys ever seen before even these people they talk about it its one of the great political phenomenas many of them have said it even some of them who truly truly dislike me theyve said this is one of the great phenomenas i mean look at this place at almost one oclock in the morning  so i love michigan and i was the man of the year or something like four or five years ago and i came here and i have so many friends in michigan but i came here to get the award they asked me to make a speech i made a speech and i talked about how michigan theyre ripping your auto companies apart theyre taking your jobs theyre closing your plants and theyre moving them to mexico and other places but mostly to mexico in this case and i talked about that and everybody liked me in michigan i said but you know we have to do something about it but i wasnt a politician but i talked about it and i kept talking about it and talking about it and talking and then i see ford moving a big plant and then ford just two weeks ago announcing their small cars are going to be produced and made entirely in mexico  and its getting worse and worse and i developed a great relationship with the people of michigan so the reason im here is that i thought new hampshire was going to be my last speech and i heard that crooked hillary clinton was coming to michigan i said lets follow it up lets follow it up  and i said theres no place id rather be for my last rally right here in michigan late at night  and full of energy and life boy do we have energy and life wow  although this is our last rally of this campaign its almost hard to believe we started a yearandahalf ago we started with  very talented people  governors senators dr ben carson  great guy a lot of talented people  and one by one by one and most of them have been terrific and give us great support ben carson is one of them as you know but  but who would have thought  and now we have one flawed candidate left to beat  one flawed candidate  its going to be the very beginning of a new adventure because the new adventure we have to win we have to go out and vote but the new adventure is making america great again were going to do it after we win im going to be coming back to michigan a lot im going to be coming back every time we open a new factory or a new automobile plant and we will do it and well do a lot of expansion were going to do a lot of expansion i know exactly what to do folks were not going to lose your jobs anymore were not going to lose your jobs anymore  we are going to bring back the automobile industry to michigan  bigger and better and stronger than ever before youve been mistreated  michigan now stands at the crossroads of history if we win michigan we will win this historic election and then we truly will be able to do all of the things we want to do they wont be taking our jobs any longer they wont be doing the things theyve been doing to us well end up having great health care strong borders well build up our military we have no choice we have a depleted military well be able to do the things we want to do when you step into that voting booth today  its now today  there is one core question for you to consider do you want america to be ruled by the corrupt political class   or do you want america to be ruled by you the people thats what it is  by the people  the way it was supposed to have been for a long time weve lost track and for michigan we will bring back your automobile production and we will bring back your industry wait until you see what we do for michigan ive been talking about it for a long time crooked hillary has not talked about it folks she doesnt know where to begin she talked about bringing industry back to new york state when she was a new york state senator let me tell you not only didnt it come back look at upstate new york its a disaster it got worse people fled companies fled its a disaster the corrupt politicians and their special interests have ruled over this country for a very long time today is our independence day  today the american working class is going to strike back finally  real change begins with immediately repealing and replacing the disaster known as obamacare  it has just been announced that the residents of michigan are going to experience a massive doubledigit premium hike like you wouldnt believe its not going to matter that much honestly because were going to terminate it youre not going to have to worry about it ok dont worry  now on the other hand if something horrible happens tomorrow get ready to pay a lot more than youre even paying now but thats not going to happen im looking at that fantastic young lady right there shes shaking her head  no way no way not going to happen right  good not going to happen nah i dont think youre going to have to worry about the premiums but with obamacare premiums are surging companies are leaving insurers are fleeing doctors are quitting and deductibles are going right through the roof yet hillary clinton wants to doubledown on obamacare making it even more expensive and it doesnt work its no good im asking for your vote so we can repeal and replace obamacare and save health care for every family in michigan and throughout the united states of america we have to do it  we dont have a choice real change also means restoring honesty to our government so the first thing we should do lets get rid of hillary okay thats probably the  that would be a very good first step thats a good first step  hillary clinton is the most corrupt person ever to seek the office of the presidency of the united states  she is being protected by a totally rigged system that ive been talking about for a long time its a rigged system now its up to the american people to deliver justice at the ballot box and i dont have to say do it tomorrow do it in a week youre going to do it today youll go to sleep for a couple of hours right  go to sleep you go to sleep for a couple of hours you wake up you cast your vote then you can go back to sleep or go to work you people wont go to sleep youll go back to work i know my people youll get up after about two hours youll vote and youll go to work  i know my michigan people i know i have so many friends here they work they dont stop we are finally going to close the history books on the clintons and their lies and schemes and corruption  we will open a bright new chapter focused on you the american people my contract with the american voter begins with a plan to end government corruption and to take our country back from the special interests i want the entire corrupt washington establishment to hear our words our words when we say  you know what were going to say were going to win today and were going to washington dc to drain the swamp  absolutely absolutely  oh you probably heard me say it drain the swamp   oh this is beautiful isnt it too bad that the corrupt media never show the crowds you know it is like almost one in the morning and we have i think they said  people here every corner  look at this  every corner and you know what theyll say donald trump is speaking before a crowd of people  these people are the worst hes speaking in front of a few thousand people  at the core of my contract is my plan to bring back our jobs the trade policies of hillary clinton from nafta to china to korea to the transpacific partnership  which by the way is a disaster    have raided your factories crushed your auto industry and gutted your communities you know it and shes not  look folks honestly you couldnt give her a shot youre wasting your time youre wasting your time  shes not going to be able to do the job shes not going to be able to do the job  just look at her record but forget her record not going to be able to do the job she doesnt have a clue michigan has lost more than one in four of its manufacturing jobs since nafta a deal signed by bill clinton and supported by his lovely wife hillary right  right  by the way you know who i spotted in the audience mayor rudolph giuliani  rudy giuliani  hes got energy that guy hes all over the place going from place to place to place got a lot of energy a lot of  a lot of this up here too  america has lost  listen to this   factories  not  not   factories since china entered the world trade organization another bill and hillarybacked disaster  we are living through the greatest jobs theft in the history of the world theres never been anything like this our jobs are being stolen like candy from a baby not going to happen anymore folks there are going to be consequences  there are going to be  when they fire our people our great people who have been working for   years at these companies  they fire our people there are going to be consequences it doesnt work that way not anymore and the politicians have been working on this problem for  years for  years and its so simple to solve delphi laid off  workers and moved their jobs to mexico and other countries  fte automotive laid of  workers in auburn hills beautiful place and moved their jobs to mexico  chrysler laid off  workers and moved their jobs to mexico china and to other countries ford laid off  workers and moved their jobs to mexico and many other countries  now ford is moving all of its small car production of mexico isnt that wonderful it used to be that cars were made in flint and you couldnt drink the water in mexico now the cars are made in mexico and you cant drink the damn water in flint  what the hell    yes   unbelievable say is that true though or what unbelievable you know i have a friend hes the biggest in the world at building plants thats what he does he builds plants you say build an apartment and he wouldnt know what to do he builds plants the biggest plants in the world most sophisticated plants all kinds of plants i said how are you doing hes from this country loves this country loves this whole area loves you people he wants to do them here so i said to him let me ask you how are you doing he said unbelievable i said oh thats good thats good where are you doing well mexico i said what about our country not so good he said donald you have to see what were doing in mexico were building some of the greatest plants anywhere in the world and i said isnt this sad isnt this pathetic were going to change it around i want mexico to build great plants but we need to build great plants also its got to be a twoway street folks  got to be a twoway street  and right now its a onelane highway right into these other countries they take our money they take our jobs they build their plants they build their factories we end up with unemployment and drugs thats what we end up with not going to happen any longer a trump administration will stop the jobs from leaving america and we will stop the jobs from leaving michigan that i can tell you  percent  if ford or another company wants to fire their workers in michigan and move to another country and ship their products back into the united states i will pick up the phone myself if i  because i love it  they dont want me to do that folks i want to do it its so easy i love doing it its like im a natural but ill have plenty of great representatives but we  we  im going to do it every once in a while i dont care because i love it well be calling the executives at ford or whatever company it is and well tell them very nicely that if they want to move their factory or their plant to another country they will have to pay a  percent tax when they sell their cars or their product back into the united states through what will soon be a very very powerful border  so theyll pay a tax and heres whats going to happen  percent nobodys moving folks theyre not going to move theyre not going to move ok just think of it dont worry about it well build a wall  dont worry about it a trump administration will renegotiate nafta and if we dont get the deal we want we will terminate nafta and get a much better deal for our workers and our companies   percent  we will also immediately stop the jobkilling transpacific partnership which hillary clinton called the gold standard and she lied look she lied during the debate  by the way did trump win the debate did trump win the debate  and by the way hes here did mike pence win the debate  man was that an easy  it wasnt easy it wasnt easy but he certainly made it look easy didnt he how good is this guy  wow honestly i felt so sorry for tim kaine that was like  that was like a great football team playing your local high school football players so hillary lied about it she said it was the gold standard and we caught her in the lie and all of that but when you think about it it is the gold standard its the gold standard for the other countries not for us  for the other countries were doing business with cant do it hillary will pass the tpp she will absolutely pass it which will destroy the rest of the auto industry believe me it will  just mark my words  it will destroy they dont even talk about currency manipulation in tpp and they didnt want to because it was taken out because some of our politicians wanted it taken out  the number one weapon they wanted it taken out because the special interests take care of our politicians folks but theyre not taking care of me ive spent a fortune on this campaign and ill tell you i told this to mike pence if we dont win  because everyone is saying unbelievable unbelievable it doesnt matter if you win or lose theres never been a movement like this i said let me just tell you stop right there if we dont win this will be the single greatest waste of time energy and money in my life we have to win to do what we have to do we have to win we cant just have something that looks wonderful in the history books in  years as part of our plan to bring back jobs we are going to lower taxes on american business from  percent to  percent  we will massively cut taxes for the middle class hillary clinton wants to raise your taxes very significantly  think of it were the highesttaxed nation in the world and she wants to raise your taxes and we will rebuild our inner cities i know so much about detroit i know so much about the inner cities the african american community the hispanic community has been treated horribly for a long time the politicians and the case of the inner cities  virtually all democrats for over  years sometimes a chain unbroken what theyve done is they come in and they get your vote and then they say see you  four years ill see you in four years were going to fix our inner cities right now theyre so unsafe you walk to the store to pick up a loaf of bread you get shot you get shot you know in chicago thousands and thousands of shootings since january st the inner cities are unbelievably dangerous the education is no good the safety is horrible and there are no jobs and i tell everybody what the hell do you have to lose im going to fix it we will fix it  we will fix it vice president mike pence will be involved and he is so enthused about this there is such potential we have such potential in the  the people im talking about the people theres such potential there we will fix it remember that  we will become a rich nation once again but to be a rich nation we must also be a safe nation hillary clinton wants a  percent increase in syrian refugees pouring into our country  and virtually unlimited immigration from the most dangerous regions of the world including regions overrun and controlled by isis her plan will import generations of terrorism extremism and radicalism into your schools and throughout your communities when im elected president we will suspend the syrian refugee program  and we will keep radical islamic terrorists the hell out of our country  percent  we have no choice we have no choice but we all have big hearts and we will build safe havens in syria and well get the gulf states  they have nothing but money they have nothing but money we will get them to pay for it we owe  trillion right now were not going to pay for it were going to get the gulf states to pay for it well manage it well take care of people but they cant come into our country we have enough problems ok  here in michigan youve seen firsthand the problems caused with the refugee program with large numbers of poorly vetted refugees pouring into your state without your knowledge without your support or without your approval nobody even knows where people are being placed a trump administration will not admit any refugees without the support of the local community where theyre being placed a trump administration will also secure and defend the borders of the united states and yes we will build a great great wall    so i just want to ask you one question if you dont mind at one in the morning who is going to pay for the wall   a hundred percent they dont know it yet but theyre going to pay now were going to have a great relationship with mexico but right now its a oneway street we cant have that we cant have that theyre going to build the wall hillary supports totally open borders there goes your country  and strongly supports sanctuary cities like san francisco where kate steinle was murdered by an illegal immigrant deported at least five times a trump administration will end this nightmare of violence and end it quickly we will stop illegal immigration deport all criminal aliens and dismantle every last criminal gang and cartel threatening our wonderful citizens were going to do it easily quickly  we will also repeal the obamaclinton defense sequester and rebuild our badly depleted military  there havent been many times where we need it more im honored to have the endorsement of more than  top admirals and generals and  medal of honor recipients and that list just grew a lot larger today  hillary clinton and our failed establishment have dragged us into foreign wars that have made us less safe shipped our wealth overseas to other countries and left our borders at home totally wide open that will change when we win the presidency that will change that will change has to change it has to change  from now on its going to be america first america first  and just in summing up to all americans i say it is time for change it is time for leadership just think about what we can accomplish in the first  days of a trump administration were going to have the largest tax cut since ronald reagan  and hillary wants to raise your taxes we will eliminate every unnecessary jobkilling regulation well cancel every illegal obama executive order we will protect religious liberty  and yesterday it was billy grahams th birthday meaning an hour ago yesterday

118,"Clinton","hello tampa hello usf i know im only the second most exciting thing thats happened here in the last few days your big win to open your football season got some attention but i am always happy to be at a university that is doing such a superb job in preparing the next generation of students i had the great privilege of speaking to your president dr genshaft thank you and i will talk in a minute about some of what ive learned about usf and why i think a lot of what you do here is a model for what we need to do in higher education but for me its exciting to be here with so many friends i want to start by thanking mary lent who just introduced me air force reservist former commander of the th aircraft maintenance squadron a woman who has served her country with honor and distinction i would be proud to be her commanderinchief i want to thank your extraordinary mayor bob buckhorn bob is an example of the kind of leader who gets things done by bringing people together setting big goals and working to achieve them thats exactly what i want to do as president and i look forward to working with bob and the people of this great city and region and that includes a longtime friend of mine state senator arthenia joyner i have known arthenia long before she was in elected office but shes always been an activist always trying to make things better for people ive known her for oh i hate to admit it  years and i am so grateful she is my friendthis is the countdown to one of the most important elections in our lifetimes no matter what your age this is going to determine so much about your futures the futures of our children and grandchildren the stakes could not be higher everyone knows what an important state florida is and its not just because its always a hardfought state its because florida shows all of the excitement the dynamism the opportunities as well as the challenges and problems that we have to face together so we have  days   days to make the case and i cant do it without you and im here to lay out my case one more time and to ask for your help because every single vote counts our campaign set a goal in july we launched a drive to register three million americans to vote this election we have hosted thousands of events across the country including right here in florida and today im asking every one of you to give us some of your precious time to be part of this campaign and im going to run through some of the reasons why every single person here has a real stake in making sure our country heads into the future with confidence and optimism that we truly are stronger together because thats what will determine whether we have the economy that produces more good jobs with rising incomes whether we have an education system that prepares our young people for the jobs of the future whether college is affordable whether student debt can be paid back whether our health care system works whether we lead the world with strength and steadiness working with allies and partners to make sure that we move toward peace and prosperity there is an exciting bold agenda before us but it cannot be done by any one person it must be done by all of us and that is something that donald trump does not understand among the many troubling things that were said at his convention  and honestly i sometimes didnt recognize what country they were talking about it was so dire so dark so divisive so dangerous but among the things he said was i alone can fix it think of who that leaves out  our men and women in uniform troops on the front line people like mary who put on the uniform of the air force to serve our country think about the police and firefighters who rush toward danger think about those brave police officers and emergency responders in orlando when the pulse nightclub was attacked think about all the teachers the educators the professors the staff who work to give young people a much better chance in 
so a young man young woman were at our convention and heres the story they told they were talking together one day after work theyd known each other and the young woman said you know im excited because i think im actually going to be able to save some money for college making  an hour and her friend the young man looked at her and he goes im making  an hour and the young woman said well you didnt have any experience before this job doing this did you he said no you know i didnt she said well what do you think happened and the man said oh it must be a mistake so they together  and i give the young man a lot of credit  good guy right they go to tell the manager that theres been a mistake theyre doing exactly the same job hes making  cents more an hour what happens the manager fired them both and you know what thats legal if you find out about somebody elses salary even if youre doing exactly the same job you can be retaliated against including being fired in most places and so when i say lets have equal pay and some people i see looking quizzical at me  they say well of course youve got to have equal pay well yeah if youre in the military and the pay scale is set or youre in the government and its set or youre under a union contract and its set but if youre in the vast majority of jobs in america you have no idea whether youre being paid fairly so we cannot let that continue thats wrong in america if youre doing the job you deserve to get the pay and so how are we going to fund this ill tell you were going where the money is were going to the people who have made the money in the last  years were going to the top   percent the millionaires the billionaires theyre going to have to start paying for supporting our military supporting our education system supporting our healthcare system there could not be a bigger contrast between what i propose when it comes to taxes and what donald trump has proposed he actually has proposed giving trillions  and i mean that with a t  trillions in tax cuts to big corporations millionaires billionaires and wall street money managers that would not only explode our national debt it would lead to massive cuts in education and healthcare and many of his proposals would really benefit his own family but do nothing for the remaining  plus percent of americans and in fact independent analysts have said this theyve looked at our plans  he doesnt have much in the way of plans but theyve looked at what he has said and theyve concluded if we did what trump is recommending we would lose  million jobs in four years if we do what im recommending we stand to gain over  million jobs in the next four years i want to work with our teachers and educators  i respect teachers and educators  and i want to give them the support they need to do the job we ask and i want to support universities like this one heres one of the reasons why  students  percent on pell grants a lot of people would never have gotten an education if it werent for the federal pell grant program right but heres whats most impressive a lot of schools have a lot of pell grants this university graduates all categories of students at the same rate if youre a pell grant student a nonpell grant student if youre white africanamerican latina latino asian everybody graduates at the same rate and why that happens is because this university makes a particular commitment to every student and moves as quickly as possible to help kids who maybe are first generation college students  right ive got to tell you when i got to college  now my father went to college on a football scholarship i knew i wasnt going to college on a football scholarship my mother had a very difficult childhood she never got to go to college so my dad couldnt really tell me much about going to college because he basically played football for four years and loved i
at the rate we are going by  which is not that far away  billion of coastal property in this state will be flooding at high tide and whenever our infrastructure is threatened so too is our homeland security the next president will have to work with communities like tampas to prepare for future storms when im in the oval office im going to work with local leaders to make smart investments in infrastructure to help protect regions from flooding and other effects of climate change im going to continue to continue to work on the international and national level to try to turn the clock back to stabilize and reduce emissions even more to try to gain more time but were going to have to begin working immediately on mitigation and resilience and prevention as well  and lets not forget the next president also has to keep our country safe from public health crises like zika its painfully obvious we cant rely on the republican congress or republican governors to fund an adequate response they cant help themselves from playing games even when lives are on the line i call on all republicans to put people before politics and finally vote in favor of a clean funding bill to fight zika right here in florida
but the failure of the republicans in congress including your republican senator means that we cant always count on them can we so last month i announced that as president i will create a public health rapid response fund to be available when emergencies occur to have a consistent budget to better enable government agencies at all levels to quickly respond to major public health crises and pandemics this will complement our efforts to prepare our country to deal with those challenges and because of climate change were going to have more of them because of mobility around the world you can get on a plane in africa and bring ebola to the united states you can be a mosquito in brazil and make your way to florida weve got to be better prepared its always better to invest a penny in the front end than to have to pay many dollars after the crisis has already occurred thats why it is time that when we talk about protecting public health to put politics aside and put our peoples needs first

now im pretty excited about being here today and i was especially honored to receive the endorsement of lebron james now i may become president but he will be king of ohio for as long as there is a king im obviously delighted to be endorsed by someone who has demonstrated such leadership and such extraordinary ability but ill tell you what really moved me the most is hes given back to his hometown he has advocated for small businesses for kids giving kids more opportunities hes spoken out on behalf of criminal justice reform he is someone who uses the platform he has earned because he has worked so hard over so many years to speak out and speak up for those who may not have a voice so i am truly honored to have his support and especially to be able to tell people in his hometown how i am looking forward not just to watch him play basketball but to continue to be a leader in so many different ways

now we do have an important election coming up who here is planning to vote well that is very good news because this is the most consequential election i think in our lifetimes the choice could not be clearer and we need everybody to show up and how many of you still have to register to be able to vote everybody here registered well i want you to talk to your friends because the deadline for registering in ohio is october th thats just a little over a week away and if youre not sure whether or not someone you know is registered or maybe you yourself want to be absolutely positive you can go to iwillvotecom  see that sign over there you can go to iwillvotecom and confirm your registration and register if you need to

and everybody everybody in the campaign is crisscrossing ohio my daughters been here a bunch tim kaine and his wonderful wife anne have been here my husbands coming back tomorrow for a twoday bus tour through ohio and i will be back because we care about ohio and we want to make sure ohio makes the best choice for the future of the people of this great state

now im going to close this campaign the way that i started my career a long time ago fighting for kids and families standing up for people who may need a little extra boost in life making sure that this country delivers on the promise of the american dream see i believe the american dream is big enough for everybody if youre willing to work for it and do your part you should be able to get ahead and stay ahead in america

now my opponent and i have a really different view about what it takes to get ahead and stay ahead and that may be because we have very different life experiences and thats okay people have different families different views of the world but heres what i have noticed i have noticed that he always puts himself first and maybe thats because he was born into a millionaire family he started his business with a  million loan from his father his father bailed him out apparently thats a pattern you got to be bailed out when you do business with him and he then has taken advantage of every single element of our tax code of our economy that he could

and along the way along the way he has stiffed people  small businesses and workers and contractors and thats part of the reason i take this election so seriously my dad was a small businessman my grandfather was a factory worker and so my dad when he got out of the navy in world war ii he started a small business he started a printing business he printed fabrics for draperies and he worked really hard he had a print plant in chicago  no natural light no windows just a long room where there were two big long tables and the fabric would be laid out on them and then if youve ever seen silkscreens thats what he did you take the silkscreen you put it down you pour the paint in you take the squeegee you go across you lift it up you go down to the end of one long table you start on the end of the other long table and then if it was going to be two colors you would add another color doing exactly the same thing it was before there was machines my dad couldnt have afforded that anyway but he worked really hard and he produced a good middle class life for our family

and so when i think about the way that my opponent has taken advantage of people i got to tell you i am really grateful my dad never got a contract from him because i have met people he stiffed i have met people im talking painters and plumbers im talking dishwashers marble installers glass installers architects a man who sold him pianos for one of his casinos he wouldnt pay them now you got to stop and ask yourself what kind of person does that somebody who works hard and has a contract which they expect to be honored

and so i met one of the men i met a man who had a small family business installed the glass in one of those casinos submitted the bill and trump said no were not going to pay it and the man was stunned as so many hundreds and hundreds of people have been and then they come back the trump organization or trump himself and say okay well give you  cents  cents maybe  cents on the dollar now some of those small businesses they couldnt afford that they had bought the material they had provided the services trump didnt care he basically just walked away from them made them feel like they had failed even though they had done the work theyd been asked to provide i got to tell you that is not the way were supposed to do business in america and i cant imagine having a president who believes that thats the way youre supposed to treat people but youre going to help me make sure he never gets near the white house

now earlier today earlier today in toledo i talked about all of the changes i want to make in how we can protect americans from the kind of corporate fraud that we have seen too much of now the most recent example is wells fargo wells fargo actually had people thousands of their employees putting customers into accounts they either never asked for or they did not understand and then every time they put somebody into a new account they got fees which then gave them the chance to get a bigger bonus  a really crummy game that hurt people so thankfully we have an organization now the consumer finance protection bureau in washington who looks out for people who get  that is an important part of how were going to protect and its run you may know by richard cordray from ohio

now will it surprise you that donald trump wants to eliminate that agency well were not going to let that happen that agency has already recovered  billion for consumers whove been taken advantage of by corporations and the behavior of wells fargo shows clearly that we have got to keep the pressure on these big banks so they can never wreck the economy again the way they did back in 

i have said were never going to let wall street wreck main street again and i mean it contrast that  contrast that with my opponent he wants to do away with the rules that have been imposed on wall street he basically wants to let wall street the banks the hedge funds all these other institutions basically do whatever they want again well ill tell you what were not going to let that happen we need more rules not fewer rules on them

i want us to make it easier to start a small business to get rid of the red tape to make credit available to make it clear that most new jobs are going to come from small businesses in america so we should have a big dynamic small business economy but we are not going to let big business and big corporations call the shots anymore that is not working for us

but trumps whole economic vision is really trickledown economics its the same  the same idea that has failed us before you see he believes that all you do is cut taxes on the wealthy and then it trickles down well we know that doesnt work weve been down that road and what he wants to do is i think its fair to say trickledown on steroids what he has proposed would slash taxes on the wealthy

now im a little confused about this because for a long time weve been saying hey where are your tax returns a lot of us wondered what he was hiding because you know if it was something that would make him look good he would put them right out there everybody whos ever run for president in at least the last  years has released their tax returns my husband and i have about  years of tax returns out there you can go and look at them and you can see that we paid a lot of taxes and frankly we were grateful we could we are grateful for the blessings that weve had over the last  years

so did any of you see the debate last monday well i raised it i said well maybe he doesnt want us to see that he owes hundreds of millions of dollars to foreign banks and foreign lenders or maybe he hasnt paid any taxes now shortly after the debate it was discovered that indeed back in the s he apparently lost a billion dollars on bad investments and failing casinos ask yourself this who loses money on casinos really and yesterday some of his supporters said well it just shows hes a genius that he didnt pay any taxes well what kind of genius loses a billion dollars in the first place

in the debate he said not paying taxes made him smart but think about what that means it means that all the rest of us who pay our taxes right  whats he saying about us but more than that zero taxes means zero for our vets zero for our military zero for pell grants to send young people to college zero for health zero for education and you stop and ask yourself this is the same person whos been going around really just dumping on america he says our militarys a disaster well he could not be more wrong but thank goodness the rest of us paid to support our men and women in uniform who have done so much for us

today in colorado he claimed he brilliantly used the laws to avoid paying taxes well that just shows number one he is the poster boy  the poster boy  for the same rigged system that he would make even worse just think about it he paid zero at least for about  years we believe now based on what we know and hes advocating for huge tax cuts that would help him and his family even more whats he want us to do pay him to lose money really

theres a lot more to this story and were just slowly getting it into the public eye so we know hes stiffed people didnt pay his bills we know he took bankruptcy depending on how you count four or six times you know that he paid no taxes for probably  years we dont know what his taxes would be after that hes always talked about how he cant release his taxes because hes under audit but he admitted everything before  is not under audit so donald release everything up until  show the american people your taxes

ill tell you another thing if im fortunate enough to be president were going to pass a law requiring anybody who is a nominee of a major national party to have to release their taxes

so what did we find out today well a story just came out saying that donald trump used chinese steel and aluminum for two out of the last three construction projects so instead of buying his steel and aluminum from american plants here in ohio and pennsylvania instead of supporting hardworking families and american jobs he once again stiffed us he sent that money overseas

now he spends a lot of time bashing the chinese right you hear that all the time when he talks well it turns out he bought his steel and aluminum from the chinese it turns out he owes big money to the chinese so this is another one of the episodes of his reality television show where he is saying one thing and doing something else

now for years china has been undermining american businesses and workers by illegally dumping cheap aluminum and steel into our markets you know that right and it sounds like donald trump has been buying that dumped steel and aluminum how can he make america great again when he wont even buy american products in our country

and ill tell you this is personal to me because as a senator i went before the international trade commission on behalf of steel workers in new york who i represented and as secretary of state i went toetotoe with the chinese i have put forward an agenda to crack down on trade abuses from countries like china to stand up for american workers and to rebuild american infrastructure with american materials like steel and aluminum

and today in toledo i pointed out because chrysler just announced an expansion of the plant there for the new jeep wrangler  about  more jobs right i pointed out when the automobile industry was flat on its back and  workers in ohio could have been absolutely out of a job  more than we can even imagine in terms of the longlasting impact on the economy here  donald trump said he didnt care save it dont save it didnt matter to him

well ill tell you where i stood i stood in favor of saving the american automobile industry and look what we got last year our auto industry had the best year theyve had in a really long time and so weve got to keep building it weve got to keep making sure that there are good jobs and weve got to protect good union jobs against the kind of assault that is coming from all sides

so now i know that ohio is a tough tough state youve got to get out there youve got to talk to people answer questions make your case thats what weve been doing thats what were going to do all the way to the end of this election but i need your help to talk to anybody you know here who thinks they might be voting for trump i know you know people i know you do and youve got to stage an intervention youve got to sit them down and point out how everything he says he wants to do is absolutely opposite of what he has done and how everything he has proposed will help people like him and his family but not the vast majority of families in ohio in fact if you look at his tax proposals they benefit him and other wealthy people  hedge fund managers and the like and they would actually raise taxes on middleclass families

now thats the kind of contrast were getting out in the campaign but thats why we need your help  to make sure you go out and talk to everybody and i know people want change thats part of the american dynamic spirit we want change well ill tell you one thing that is certain is well have change  its just what kind of change its whether or not we have change that helps the vast majority of americans hardworking americans middleclass families or continues to only help those at the top i want an economy that works for everyone not just those at the top and thats exactly what were going to fight for and that is what were going to get

ill tell you ive been called a lot of things right ive never been called quitter if i tell you im going to get up every day and fight for you that is exactly what i will do

but i know i cant do it  i cant do it alone donald trump stood on the stage of his convention and just once again painted this dark and dire picture of america and then he said i alone can fix it he gets confused between leadership and dictatorship he has a hard time remembering who our friends are and who our adversaries are he has a weird fascination with dictators like vladimir putin we have a lot of people living in this part of ohio who either themselves or their parents or grandparents came from countries that were under the yoke of oppression and were never going to let that happen again

and so when trump basically signs up for putins wish list thats bad enough but then when hes cavalier  and im not talking about basketball  when he is cavalier about nuclear weapons saying that oh he doesnt care if other countries get them in fact you know if there were a nuclear war in east asia if japan got nuclear weapons if south korea got nuclear weapons hey just go at it folks he even said he wouldnt care if saudi arabia got nuclear weapons one thing that has been a bedrock of american foreign policy through democratic and republican presidents going back to the dawn of the atomic age is we were committed to trying to keep other countries from getting access to nuclear weapons to be able to stop proliferation and now its even more important because its not only states that we have to worry about like north korea weve got to worry about terrorists getting their hands on nuclear weapons the last thing we want to do is just act like it doesnt matter because it does

i was involved in putting together the sanctions against iran that drove them to the negotiating table and what i learned  if you use diplomacy and youre tough about it you can actually get an agreement that put a lid on their nuclear program and were going to make sure they follow it to the period the comma everything in that agreement im going to enforce and we still have challenges with iran but i think were in a stronger position given the fact that they are not racing for a nuclear weapon because we have intrusive inspections

so i know diplomacy can work because ive done it and i know that  we can defeat isis and the terrorists if we work with other nations if we have a coalition that actually takes them out from the air takes them out on the ground and fights them online where they are doing so much damage by radicalizing and recruiting young people ive been laying out my plan for what i think it will take to defeat isis and i have no doubt we will and donald says he has a secret plan that he wont tell us about well theres no secret he has no plan

and weve got to do more  weve got to do more to make sure we protect our country we need the best intelligence we can get the best cooperation among law enforcement at all levels of government i will not rest as a former senator from new york on  i take this as a personal responsibility i will do everything i can to keep our country safe and to work with others to defeat the threat posed by terrorism

and finally my friends weve got to bring our country back together there is too much divisiveness too much fingerpointing and scapegoating our diversity is one of our strengths we have to listen to each other we dont have to agree that is not required but we need to be respectful we need to listen and then we need to roll up our sleeves and get to work

when i was first lady senator secretary of state i worked to find common ground with everybody i worked when i was first lady with republicans and democrats to create the childrens health insurance program that insures eight million kids when i was in the senate i worked with practically every republican i served with and they all have nice things to say about me when im not running for something and i will work again to move our country forward and to change the  of that and we had to get  republicans and i worked tirelessly and we got them we did that there is a lot we can do if we start listening and respecting each other and avoid the kind of namecalling and insults that we see too much of

so im excited about the campaign but im even more excited about getting to work for you  being able to get up every day and find a way to try to help somebody i mean that is how i was raised in my church and by my family and that is what i have done through my advocacy work and my legal work on behalf of people who needed a voice and i will do everything possible to make sure i deliver results for you and the reason that i have published a book with my great running mate tim kaine  its right here  is real simple i want you to know what we say were going to do because i want you to hold me accountable i dont believe in bait and switch where i say oh were going to do something and then i really am over here doing something else that kind of reminds you of somebody doesnt it no heres what were going to try to do were going to pay for it by raising taxes on the wealthy and closing loopholes on corporations and i am the only candidate who ran this whole campaign saying i will never raise taxes on the middle class that is not going to happen when i am president

so please join this campaign in the last  days talk to your friends remember friends dont let friends vote for trump i am motivated every day because now im a grandmother  two beautiful grandchildren  and i think about their future i think about their lives i think about our country i want our country to be the land of opportunity the place where dreams do come true if youre willing to work for them not just for my grandchildren but for every child i want every child in this country to have a chance to live up to his or her godgiven potential and if you will help me win this election and then help me work to make it come true we will have a country that delivers on our dreams and a future we can all be proud of

thank you and god bless you"
120,"Clinton","this is the day the lord has made let us rejoice and be glad in it
i am so  the world outside challenged the faith that comes from belief in here in this magnificent house of worship we pray for peace when there is too much violence outside of these walls in here we are called to confront injustice even when the world out there fails to see it in here we see the world as it is but we pray for the strength and wisdom to build the world as it should be

it has been  days since mr scott was shot and killed twelve days since his wife rakeiya scott watched her husband die and seven children lost their father now we dont yet know all the details about the shooting but we do know this family and this community is in pain and therefore we pray for them and we pray for all families who have suffered similar losses but we do more than pray as ms bradford said we do what each of us can do not everyone can march but everyone can talk and everyone can reach out and everyone can vote

too many african american families have been in the same tragic situation that the scott family has found themselves in fact the day before mr scott died another father terence crutcher was killed in a police encounter in tulsa oklahoma and there have been many others so many fathers and sons and even mothers and daughters who have died either after encounters with the police or at the hands of civilians with guns while they were doing things that were ordinary everyday activities walking home from the store with iced tea and skittles listening to music in their car with friends

and we also know  and we must not forget  that violence has touched the families of police officers men and women who put on the uniform and put their lives on the line to protect others from dallas to baton rouge to philadelphia the families of fallen officers have also been dealt a great blow and they deserve our prayers as well

its been a hard year hasnt it think about how many times president obama has had to console our nation about another senseless tragedy another shattered family another distressed community and our children are watching and they feel it too youve seen that right here in charlotte last monday at the city council meeting yearold taje gaddy said i wake up every morning scared that i wont get to grow up because i am black

a nineyearold zianna oliphant whos here with us today along with her brother marquis and her family also spoke at that city council meeting with tears pouring down her face and when i read what she had said i had tears in my eyes too she said we are black people and we shouldnt have to feel like this its a shame that our fathers and mothers are killed and we cant even see them anymore its a shame that we have to go to their graveyard and bury them we need our fathers and mothers to be by our side what courage and clarity that young lady showed to the world

but can you imagine nine years old she should be thinking about happy adventures dreaming about all the wonderful things her future holds for her instead shes talking about graveyards our entire country should take a moment to really look at whats going on here and across america to imagine what we see on the news and what we hear about imagine through our childrens eyes

im a grandmother and like every grandmother i worry about the safety and security of my grandchildren but my worries are not the same as black grandmothers they have different and deeper fears about the world that their grandchildren face it makes my heart ache when kids like zianna are going through this and trying to make sense of the absolutely senseless i know how i would feel i wouldnt be able to stand it if my grandchildren had to be scared and worried the way too many children across our country feel right now but because my grandchildren are white because they are the grandchildren of a former president and secretary of state lets be honest here  they wont face the kind of fear that we heard from the young children testifying before the city council

you know every child deserves the same sense of security every child deserves the same hope they should not be facing fear they should be learning and growing imagining who they can be and what their contributions to our country could be as well weve got to take action weve got to start now not tomorrow not next year now we know we cant solve all these problems over night which means we dont have a moment to lose proverbs tells us where there is no vision the people perish so lets hold on to a common vision let s come together to make america a place where every child no matter who they are where theyre born or what they look like has the chance to live up to their godgiven potential

being stronger together with this common vision means rejecting those forces that try to pit us against each other we can acknowledge that implicit bias still exists not just in police departments but throughout our country without vilifying police officers we can call for reforms to policing while still appreciating the many courageous and admirable officers out there who are doing their jobs with honor and integrity i think about an officer named montrell jackson you might not have heard of him but i want you to he was one of the officers murdered in baton rouge a few days before he died he wrote on facebook he was black but he wore blue in uniform he wrote i get nasty hateful looks

out of uniform some consider me a threat these are trying times please dont let hate infect your heart and then he closed by saying that if anyone saw him on patrol and wanted a hug i got you

montrell jackson knew that making our communities safer and juster are not conflicting ideas

and most officers will tell you they cant do one without the other

i believe we need endtoend reform in our criminal justice system not half measures but full measures with real followthrough in america everyone should be respected by the law and have respect for the law that starts with being honest

being unafraid to face the facts face the fact that black men are far more likely to be stopped searched by police charged with crimes and sentenced to longer prison terms than white men for doing the same thing we need to fix a system where too many black parents are taken from their kids and imprisoned for minor offenses we need to make sure our police officers are trained in deescalating tense situations

we need to dismantle the socalled schooltoprison pipeline and instead invest in education from early childhood through high school into higher education

gun violence is by far the leading cause of death for young black men more than the next nine causes combined weve got to make sure there are good jobs equality affordable housing in every zip code in america we need to make investments in communities that have been left out and left behind i am a strong supporter of congressman jim clyburns plan to put  percent of our federal funds into  percent of the communities that have generational poverty for  years or more

now there are some out there who see this as a moment to command the flames of resentment and division who want to exploit peoples fears even though it means tearing our nation even further apart they say that all of our problems will be solved simply by more law and order as if the systemic racism plaguing our country doesnt exist now of course we need safe neighborhoods no one is against that of course we need communities that are free from the epidemic of gun violence of course we need that but we also need justice and dignity and equality and we can have both this is not an eitheror question for america

i want us to commit ourselves to this common vision that is where i will build on the work that president obama has done and i will be sure that this is not just about a campaign or an election this is much bigger than an election these are issues ive been fighting for since i was a young lawyer working for the childrens defense fund going to south carolina to try to get young teenagers  yearolds out of jails with adult offenders i care deeply about this because its not just personal to so many of us its about the kind of country you want to be and the future we want for all of our children and grandchildren i think about that every time i see my grandchildren or every time i see a bright energetic impressive young woman like zianna come up here a minute would you

i love your dress

you know god loves us all right we are called to care for and cherish each other its not easy it is not but that is our mission and that is what we are called to do not only as christians but as americans as human beings to understand and respect each other to fight for each others children each others dignity each others opportunity as if they were our own now make no mistake this is not easy work youve been doing this since adam and eve came here but it is righteous work protecting all of gods children is americas calling remember what scripture also tells us let us not become weary in doing good for at the proper time we will reap a harvest if we do not give up we will not grow weary and we will not lose heart we will get up every single day have faith in one another and in our future and work for that better day for all of gods people thank you"
121,"Clinton","thank you boy wow thank you wow did anybody see that debate last night oh yes one down two to go i am so excited to be back here at wake tech i was here  years ago and i was so impressed then with the kinds of programs and opportunities that are offered here to people like christine that i wanted to come back of course to raleigh but i wanted to come back here to wake tech when christine was talking i was backstage watching her on a screen we had there and she kept saying about how she was about to cry i was about to cry her story says so much not just about her but about our country we are a country of second chances and third and fourth chances for people willing to work for them get up every day do their best thats the basic bargain of america and i was really proud of christine

now theres a lot that i want to talk about today but let me start with this because you may or may not know today is national voter registration day and you see some signs people are holding i will vote now thats not only a great sign that shows youre committed to vote but its a website and you can go to iwillvotecom to make sure you are registered and i hope you all will and i hope youll tell everybody that you know to do the same because we want to make sure people are registered

and there is still time to get registered here in north carolina and i hope that you will because think about everything thats at stake in this election right here in north carolina the very meanspirited wrongheaded decision by your legislature and governor to pass and sign house bill  has hurt this state but more than that its hurt people it has sent a message to so many people that well youre not really wanted youre not really part of us i think the american dream is big enough for everybody

the other thing your governor and legislature did was everything they could to make voting harder for people now they were pretty blatant about it make it harder for people of color make it harder for the elderly and make it harder for the young now some of thats been rolled back thankfully because it was so wrong and i would argue unconstitutional but the best way to show hey in a democracy like ours we can have the most vigorous vibrant debate thats what its about but we want everybody to exercise his or her right to vote thats the way were supposed to be making decisions it distorts our democracy if some groups of people try to prevent other people from being able to do that

now i have won elections and i have lost elections so i know what the difference is but ill tell you this i believe in what our founders established for us to govern ourselves to continue to widen the circle of opportunity and that includes the opportunity to be heard to express yourself your voice and your vote and the best way to reaffirm our commitment to that fundamental american value is to show up and vote and demonstrate the importance of your vote

i believe that we may have a recordsetting turnout in this election some folks who follow this are saying we could have the biggest turnout weve ever had now that kind of makes sense because you could not have two more different visions about where we want our country to go in the future and who we are fighting for but early information is actually quite encouraging were seeing spikes in early voting and were seeing voting rates among african americans latinos and young people going up and for the first time the estimate is that young people could represent  percent of the vote

now i would love to see that obviously i hope people vote for me but i would love to see that because every election is about the future and honestly its more about the future of young people and children than its ever been because of the difference in the approaches and the experiences of me and my opponent

now last night i got a chance  i got a chance to say a few things about what i want to do if im so fortunate enough to be elected as your president and i do have this oldfashioned idea that if im asking for your vote i should tell you what i want to do and i also got to convey my excitement about what we can do together you see i really think the central question in this election is what kind of country we want to be and what kind of future we want to build for our children and our grandchildren

and i also got to convey my excitement about what we can do together you see i really think the central question in this election is what kind of country we want to be and what kind of future we want to build for our children and our grandchildren i think about that a lot in part because i started out working for the childrens defense fund its always been my passion about what we can do  to help more kids live up to their godgiven potential

and during this campaign people have asked me well how did you get interested in thatand the simple answer is my mother had such a neglected childhood she was basically abandoned by her parents sent to live with grandparents who didnt want her by the age of  she was out on her own working in a home babysitting keeping house she was basically a maid and when i think about my mothers own life and how she told me when i was old enough to understand how different her life was than the one that she created for me and my brothers she would say she was so often saved by the kindness of other people

we overlook the importance of just how we treat each other the respect we show the kindness the love that we show and im well aware thats not something you put necessarily on a campaign website but ive been talking about it because i think weve got to reassert our fundamental connection to each other

when my mother was in first grade she never had any food and her first grade teacher noticed that in those days they just brought food a little bag of food then theyd sit in the classroom and eat it and my mother never had any food and that first grade teacher noticed that and began to bring extra food but without embarrassing her she would say you know dorothy i brought too much food would you like this sandwich would you like this milk and it wasnt until she herself was much older that my mother realized that that teacher fed her for that school year something she didnt have to do but her love for her students her recognition of a child who wasnt well taken care of meant that she stepped in

and then when my mother worked as a maid she really wanted to go to high school she started working right before she would have been in high school because she had to get out of her grandparents home and the woman she worked for realized how much my mother wanted to go to high school and so she said to her if you get up early  it sounds like christine getting up so early if you get up early and you get your chores done you can go to high school and thats what my mother did for four years she got up early and then she literally had to run run to get to high school it sounds harsh but not for my mom she thought it was such a great gift of kindness that this woman gave her a place to live gave her food to eat gave her the chance to go to high school

so when i talk about us being stronger together im not just talking about what our government needs to do im talking about what each of us can do to contribute we do need to make sure  we need to make sure that our economy does work for everyone not just those at the top and that means weve got to make investments in more good new jobs infrastructure jobs advanced manufacturing jobs technology and innovation clean renewable energy jobs and weve got to do more to help small businesses because thats where most of the new jobs will come from

as i said last night my dad was a small businessman when he got out of the navy after world war ii he started this small business printing drapery fabrics and he had a print plant in chicago it was just  it was dark room there was no natural light he had two long tables and hed spread that fabric on the table and then he would take silkscreens  if youve ever seen one  and hed start at one end and hed put it down hed pour the paint in and hed take the squeegee and hed lift it up and hed go all the way down to the end of one table and then hed start on the other table and he would do that until he got the job done and i would help him out from time to time so i knew how hard he worked but he was so proud that he could give us a good middle class life because his dad was a factory worker and so he was able to do what we want to see in america keep going keep reaching move as high as your hard work and ambition will take you

so i want us to have an economy that works for everyone to grow the economy to create more jobs but i also want a fairer economy because  when you work hard you should not be still in poverty at the end of the year but if you are a minimum wage worker if you work full time minimum wage you will make  a year twothirds of minimum wage workers are women most of them with families to support and ive talked to a lot of these women sometimes ill be at a cafe or sometimes ill be in a store and ill just start talking to them and they will tell me  its one of the most humbling experiences about being out there talking to people is that if youre open to it folks will tell you whats on their minds and their hearts

so ive met women who are working two fulltime minimum wage jobs to make enough to be able to support their kids so we need to raise the national minimum wage and  and we need to guarantee finally equal pay for womens work because  number one its fair its fair and if your mother your wife your sister or your daughter is working dont you want to see her paid what she should be paid for the work she does

and the other thing i want to do i want to make sure that more companies offer profitsharing to their employees who help make the profits in the first place it makes no sense to me that sharing in profits would only go to the top executives i want more people in more jobs to realize the benefit of their hard work

and last night at the debate one of my guests was mark cuban now mark cuban who is a real billionaire by the way he has used profitsharing from his very first successful business and he not only used it while the business was going but when the business was sold he shared the profits from the sale and made  of his employees millionaires overnight

now thats the kind of business leadership i want to hold up because what weve seen from my opponent is someone who his own campaign manager has said builds a lot of businesses on the back of the little guy stiffing people  dishwashers painters plumbers architects glass installers marble installers drapery installers  across america some of them have come forward you can go to our website you can see their stories its heartbreaking and as i said last night im really glad my dad never had a contract with donald trump when he was running his small business

and in addition to making the economy fair weve got to make it work better for working families who are trying to balance family and work its really hard out there isnt it and just listening to christines story  getting up at  and studying getting kids up at  going to school going to work going to another job  thats not an uncommon story weve made it really hard for a lot of people

so heres what i think we need to do and its not a luxury its a necessity  because i want more families to be able to go as far as their hard work will take them and ive heard so many stories theyve told me  people have told me about the difficult choices they face and the stresses theyre under so lets finally since every other advanced economy has already done this lets have paid family leave so that when youre sick or your spouse or your child is sick or you have a newborn you can take care of your loved ones and lets have earned sick days so that you dont lose your job because youre sick or you go to work because youre sick and lets finally have affordable childcare which in lots of states costs as much or more than instate college tuition i dont think any family should ever have to pay more than  percent of your income for childcare and were going to fix that so that becomes the norm and then lets make sure that every educational opportunity is available without sending you into debt and breaking your budget

now tomorrow in new hampshire bernie sanders and i are going to talk about the college plan for debtfree college at public universities that he and i have worked on since the end of our primary and i want  i want every family in north carolina to know help is on the way and were also going to work so that you can refinance the debt you already have at much lower rates and get it paid off a lot sooner

now how are we going to do that well were going to go where the money is and the money is at the top were going to go after millionaires billionaires and corporations were going to raise taxes on millionaires and billionaires and were going to close corporate loopholes and i believe that we can get that done in part because youre going to send deborah ross to the senate so were going to have another democratic senator but also because our government needs to start working for everybody again  not just those who have lobbyists and lawyers and influence that hasnt worked out so well weve got to get back to first principles our job is to give the maximum opportunities to the maximum number of americans and to especially focus on people who are working their way out of poverty and people in the middle class who want to go as far as they can go lets be a government for the struggling the striving and the successful

so im excited about what we can do i really am and im going to leave it to the factcheckers to go through all of  all of donald trumps claims there were  there was a lot of work for factcheckers last night but heres a couple of things that caught my attention he actually bragged about gaming the system to get out of paying his fair share of taxes in fact i think theres a strong probability he hasnt paid federal taxes a lot of years and this is a man who goes around calling our military a disaster who goes around criticizing every institution from health care to education our vets but he probably hasnt paid a penny to support our troops or our vets or our schools or our health care systems

and when i confronted him with the reasons why he wont release his tax returns  and i got to that point where i said well maybe hes paid zero  he said that makes him smart now if not paying taxes makes him smart what does that make all the rest of us i got to tell you bill and i have been blessed we didnt come from millionaire families my husbands father  his biological father died before he was born his mother went to nursing school in order to support him they struggled they worked hard and america gave him the chance to get a good education pursue his dreams end up being president my dad as i told you worked hard

so bill and i have released all of our tax returns going back  years and if you look youll see that we paid the highest marginal rate we tried to give  percent to charity because we believe in this country and we believe with the blessings that weve been given we should do our part

the other thing he admitted last night was that he actually rooted for the housing crisis to happen i dont think id make a big bragging point out of that but he seemed to feel like hey it shows you how smart i am he basically said yeah if the housing market crashes i can go in and buy stuff and make some more money i got to tell you what kind of person believes that what kind of person would want to root for nine million families losing their homes one who should never be president is the answer to that question

and he made it very clear that he didnt prepare for that debate at one point he was kind of digging me for spending time off the campaign trail to get prepared but just trying to keep track of everything he says took a lot of time and effort and i said yeah you know what i did prepare and ill tell you something else i prepared for i prepared to be president of the united states and i think thats good

so as i said in the beginning we have two different visions here i believe we are stronger together that is at the core of what ive done over my years in advocacy and public service i believe that america is already great and it is our responsibility to make it even greater i believe that as we make our economy work for everyone we also need to keep our country safe and we need to provide strong steady leadership in the world with our allies and our partners ive laid out my views on a range of national security and foreign policy issues ive laid out my plan for defeating and destroying isis and what we hear from my opponent is dangerously incoherent its unclear exactly what he is saying

but words matter and last night it sounded like he was basically telling our treaty allies in asia hey were not sure were going to be there for you even though we have a mutual defense treaty words matter people here that and they start to doubt americas word americas intention i felt like i had to jump in and say i just want to be clear we will honor our treaties we will support our allies and our partners

this is not reality tv this is real its as real as it gets so were going to get the economy working for everybody not just those at the top were going to keep america safe provide strong steady leadership and we are going to bring our country together across the divides that have pitted americans against each other economic worries are not the only ones keeping families up at night are they theres still a lot we dont know about the recent incidents in tulsa and charlotte but this we do know weve got to bring communities together we have to listen to each other we have to make it clear that everyone is safer when there is respect from the law for the communities they protect and respect for the law from the communities that are protected

and weve got to do something about the epidemic of gun violence that has taken too many too many lives in our country again i think we can come together a very long majority of americans and a majority of gun owners believe in comprehensive background checks they believe in the second amendment as i do they believe in the right of individuals to have guns as i do but they believe along with me that we should not let guns fall into the wrong hands of people who will use them to kill other people and make it so easy to get them

so theres work to do but its great work its important work starting right here in north carolina we have  days left this elections going to be close they all are these days thats why every call you make every door you knock on every friend you register to vote to make the difference i want you if you can to text join join to  or go to hillaryclintoncom and sign up to volunteer here in north carolina and i know theres a big overflow room and im told they can hear me so to my friends in the overflow we want you to be just as involved as anyone else thank you for coming

so remember here in north carolina starting on october th you can register and vote early at the same time at any onestop early voting site in your county and remember its not just the presidential race its the governors race the lieutenant governors race the us senate race and other races up and down the ticket because we want to prove who we are as americans in this election were not fearful we dont want to build walls we want to build bridges we dont want to turn against each other we want to work with one another we want to set big goals again here in our country

ive got some big goals that i know we can achieve take climate change which my opponent says is a hoax perpetrated by the chinese i think it could be one of the biggest economic opportunities our country has ever seen and i want us to take advantage of that do the right thing and benefit from it thats what im offering were going to deploy a half a billion more solar panels in the first four years of my administration and we will produce enough clean power to power every home in america within  years and were going to lead the world because some country is going to be the clean energy superpower of the st century now the way things are stacking up i think its either going to be germany china or us i want it to be us and it will be us

that is exactly right i love this country im proud of this country i want to be a leader who brings people together in our country sets those goals gets about the business of achieving them and proves once and for all that love trumps hate thank you"
122,"Clinton","thank you thank you all hello everyone its great to be here at unc greensboro i want to thank martha for that wonderful introduction it means so much to have her here along with her wonderful daughter sara and her mother barbara and the story she told is really one that motivates me every day because it is kids like sara that led me to politics in the first place to try to make our country and our world better for them so to see sara grown up and thriving is very special and your whole familys support really means the world to me thank you martha sara barbara
i have to say its great to be back on the campaign trail as you may know i recently had a cough that turned out to be pneumonia i tried to power through it but even i had to admit that maybe a few days of rest would do me good and im not great at taking it easy even under ordinary circumstances but with just two months to go until election day sitting at home was pretty much the last place i wanted to be

but it turns out having a few days to myself was actually a gift i talked with some old friends i spent time with our very sweet dogs i did some thinking the campaign trail doesnt really encourage reflection and its important to sit with your thoughts every now and then and that did help me reconnect with what this whole campaign is about

people like me  were lucky when im under the weather  now i just want to have a conversation and other people can wave their arms and their signs but i want you to think with me for a minute about how i certainly feel lucky when im under the weather i can afford to take a few days off millions of americans cant they either go to work sick or they lose a paycheck dont they

lots of americans still dont even have insurance or they do but its too expensive for them to actually use so they toss back some tylenols they chug orange juice and they hope that the cough or the virus goes away on its own

lots of working parents cant afford childcare which in many states costs as much as college tuition so for millions of moms and dads if they get sick theres no backup theyre on their own arent they

thats the story for too many people still in america when illness strikes or an accident happens you feel youre on your own if you lose your job or cant afford college youre on your own if your aging parent starts needing more help and you dont know what to do youre on your own

life events like these are catastrophic for some families but mere bumps in the road for others i have met so many people living on a razors edge one illness away from losing their job one paycheck away from losing their home and that goes against everything we stand for as americans because some things should not come down to luck some things should be within reach for everyone no matter what like financial security like affordable health care like the peace of mind that comes with knowing that if something goes wrong your family will be okay and above all the knowledge that no matter what your president is fighting for you and will always have your back

that right there thats why i got into this race i am running for everyone working hard to support their families everyone whos been knocked down but gets back up the factory workers on their feet all day and the nurses looking after patients all night im running for young people like so many of you here who dream of changing our world for the better and for all the parents and grandparents supporting those dreams by dedicating every dollar they can spare to your education

im running for the lgbt teenager here in north carolina who sees your governor sign a bill legalizing discrimination and suddenly feels like a secondclass citizen and if anyone wonders what the costs of discrimination are just ask the people and businesses of north carolina look at whats happening with the ncaa and the acc this is where bigotry leads and we cant afford it  not here not anywhere else in america

im running for women like janelle turner back in may of last year janelle was diagnosed with breast cancer she went through nearly six months of very tough treatments last october she brought her eightyearold daughter to one of our rallies in iowa and they made a huge sign that read thirteenth chemo yesterday three more hear me roar wouldnt you want to meet the woman behind that sign well i sure did so we got talking and weve stayed in touch she keeps promising me shell see me at the inauguration and i tell her ill keep working to get there but shed better be there too

im running for her and all the mothers and fathers trying to get and stay healthy so they can be there for their kids but perhaps most of all im running for those kids standing up for children has been the work of my life as a lawyer with the childrens defense fund as first lady in arkansas in the white house as a senator i have fought for kids housed in adult jails kids who have been neglected and abused kids who couldnt get health insurance because of preexisting conditions kids with disabilities so they could go to school you heard today from someone ive known for a long time now grown up and a lovely young woman anastasia somoza i learned from my family and my methodist faith that we are each called to do all the good we can for all the people we can for however long we can and to me that means making sure all our children have the chance to live up to their godgiven potentials

so when i meet a little girl in nevada terrified that her parents are going to be deported it hits me right in the gut when i meet a little boy in flint michigan who cant drink the water at home or in school because its poisoned with lead that gets me going all i want to do is get to work making things better for them

thats why i care so much about national security too i want to give our kids a safer world to me that means a world with strong allies more friends fewer enemies and fewer nuclear weapons it also means leading the fight against climate change so we can leave our kids a health planet

my opponent in this race disagrees with me on every one of these fronts just a few days ago he said that if another countrys troops taunted ours  not fired at them but taunted them just taunts  hed responded  he would respond by blowing them out of the water he would start a war over that that is just one more reason my friends why the stakes in this election are as high as any in our lifetimes

ive been involved in politics in one way or another for many years it is not an easy business it can get rough and ive built up some defenses when it comes to public service im better at the service part than the public part but this is why i do it and this is who im in it for to make life better for children and families and thats what this race has always been about for me

well now were in the final stretch there are just  days till election day just  days till the most consequential vote of our lifetimes and just a little more than a month until early voting starts here in north carolina lets make these days count particularly here because you know what your governor and legislature tried to do  make it harder for young people to vote harder for people of color harder for people with disabilities harder for the elderly there cant be any more motivation than that to make sure every young person every person of color every person with a disability every older person turns out and votes

so in these final days lets try to tune out all the chatter and the nonstop analysis that doesnt often have much to do with what the next president has to do to create good jobs to create opportunity to make it possible for every young person to afford to go to college or get the skills that you need for the jobs of the future lets talk about what really matters

and heres my promise to you im going to close my campaign the way i began my career and the way i will serve as your president should you give me that great honor  focused on opportunities for kids and fairness for families

next week ill go to philadelphia to talk about challenges facing our young people in florida to focus on building an economy that welcomes everyones contributions including people with disabilities then ill be back here in north carolina to meet with more working families from now until november th everywhere i go im going to talk about my ideas for our country my campaign has rolled out detailed plans in  different policy areas  yes somebody actually counted everything from reining in wall street to creating goodpaying jobs to fighting alzheimers to supporting people with autism you see i have this oldfashioned notion that if youre running for president you should say what you plan to do how youre going to get it done and how youre going to pay for it you can read it all on my website hillaryclintoncom we even put it in a new book called you guessed it stronger together get a copy of it because it tells you everything tim kaine and i intend to do

now like a lot of women i have a tendency to overprepare i sweat the details whether were talking about the exact level of lead in the water in flint or how many north carolina kids are in early enrichment programs or the precise interest rate on your student loans right down to the decimal because you know what its not a detail if its your kid its not a detail if its your family its a big deal and it should be a big deal to your president

now i confess ill never be the showman my opponent is and thats okay with me just look at  look at the show he put on with dr oz today but i am going to deliver for you and your family just like i did for sarah all those years ago with the childrens health insurance program that gave her the chance to be the extraordinary young woman she is and ill tell you something else people accuse me of all kinds of things you probably have seen that but nobody ever accuses me of quitting and i will never give up ill never walk away no matter how tough the going gets im actually asking americans to hold me accountable for my ideas and hold my opponent accountable for his

we dont need a president who says the minimum wage is too high we need a president who knows that americans deserve a raise to get to a living wage we dont need a president who wants to take away peoples health coverage we need a president who wants everyone to have quality affordable health care and we dont need a president who apparently thinks only married people deserve paid leave and only mothers stay home with kids we dont need someone who rushes out a halfbaked plan just weeks before an election after decades of ignoring or putting down working moms we need a president who has spent years fighting for these issues who has a plan to support all families in all their various shapes ask yourself which candidate you can count on to be on your side respect your family stand up and fight for you and your kids

that is who you should vote for on november th because as michelle obama said in her fabulous speech at the democratic convention when we go to the polls this november the real choice isnt between democrat or republican its about who will have the power to shape our children for the next four years of their lives its also about the kind of country we want to be and what we want to leave behind for future generations people have to decide are we going to make our economy work for everyone or just those at the top are we going to bring people together or pit americans against each other and rip our country apart are we going to work with our allies to keep us safe or are we going to put a loose cannon in charge who would risk everything generations of americans have worked so hard to build

now i have a lot of confidence in the american people and in our country my opponent keeps running us down saying were weak a disaster an embarrassment every time he says things like that i think about janelle and her strength in the face of cancer or martha and sarah in the face of their health challenges and that little boy in flint who gets up every day and goes to school even though he cant drink the water see my opponent has america all wrong theres nothing we cant do when we come together as one nation set big goals and pursue them

and the american dream  the american dream is big enough for everyone to share in its promise so if you believe the minimum wage should be a living wage that no one who works fulltime should have to raise their child in poverty join us if you believe that every man woman and child in america has the right to affordable health care and women should be free to make our own health decisions join us if you believe  if you believe your working mother wife sister or daughter deserves equal pay then join us get involved these last  days go to hillaryclintoncom or text join join to  we need volunteers right here in north carolina we cant do this without you

and remember the presidential race isnt the only one this fall weve got a lot of important statewide races lets come together and send deborah ross to represent the people in the senate starting on october th you can register and vote early at the same time at any onestop early voting site in your county so the heat is on spread the word tell your friends your family your neighbors if you share our vision for americas future come be part of helping us shape it we do not have a minute to lose

we have so many blessings now its our job to deliver on those and to make sure every single person and particularly every child no matter who they are what they look like or who they love is part of the american dream now and way into the future let that be our message let that be our mission please come out and help us fight fight for you fight for our children fight for our families lets make america all that it should be thank you and god bless you"

now how many of you participated in the caucuses well weve got a bunch of active iowans here are you ready to go to the polls well luckily in iowa you can start today lots of folks dont have that opportunity across the country and a lot of our campaign volunteers are going to direct people right from this rally to early voting sites weve got one right down the street so when you finish here you can go vote and we can be on the path to victory here in iowa

any of you see that debate on monday night well one down two to go well i have to tell you it was an extraordinary experience because i did get to say a few things about the positive agenda that we want to have for our country because i want this election to be about something not just against somebody and so i am going to close this campaign the way i started decades ago fighting for kids and families because its been the cause of my life it will be the mission of my presidency because i know from my own experience that strong families are the base of a strong america and i know from personal experience how important it is to give people the tools they need to make sure that they can go as far as their hard work their talent will take them

now you may have heard me say this i started talking about this way back in the beginning of the campaign here in iowa but i was very fortunate none of us picks our parents but i really was fortunate my dad was a navy veteran a small businessman and he worked hard every single day to build a good life to provide financial security a good solid middle class life and i know how hard he worked because occasionally id go down to his print plant where he printed fabrics for draperies and it was not a very big building it didnt have any natural life there were no windows in it its what he could afford

and there were two long tables and hed roll out the fabric and then he would take a silkscreen any of you ever seen a silkscreen an oldfashioned silkscreen not far from here theres a wonderful tshirt store right and they still use silkscreens for some of their printing so he would take that silkscreen and hed put it down and he would pour the paint in then hed take a squeegee and hed go across it and then hed lift it up and hed go all the way down the table and if there was going to be more than one color hed do it all over again and then when he finished he would gather it up and put it in his car and hed go deliver it to the customer who had ordered it

thats how i was raised to think about doing business you do your best you enter into a contract or an agreement somebody orders your goods or your services and then they pay you for it right and as i said the other night one of the things that we have found out is that as his own campaign manager said about him donald trump has built a lot of businesses on the backs of the little guy her words and i have met people who have been the victims of his refusal to honor contracts to pay what had been bargained for i just am grateful that my dad never did business with him or somebody like him because we couldnt have survived all that

all that work and then to be told were not going to pay you or maybe well pay you  cents on the dollar or  cents thats just wrong what kind of person does that takes advantage of dishwashers and painters and architects and glass installers and so many people weve been looking into the records and theres a long list of people who have been mistreated i just dont believe thats the way were supposed to treat each other in america and that sure is not the way our president should be treating our citizens in our country

now my mom had a very different story my dads father was a factory worker but they had a strong family my mom was abandoned by her parents and then sent to live with grandparents and they didnt want her so she was out on her own by the age of  she was working as a housemaid and a babysitter and it may sound harsh but i will quickly tell you that it was the first time in her young life that she ever was in a family that showed love and respect for each other so for her it was a gift

and then she got another gift the woman she worked for knew that my mom wanted to go to high school and so the woman said if you can get up really early and you can get your chores done and get the little kids off to school you can go to high school but youll have to come right back that may sound harsh for a yearold but for my mother it made all the difference and thats exactly what she did for four years and most days she had to run  run  to get there but she didnt care because she wanted to get an education

so when i learned more about my moms life i knew that what i wanted to do was to stand up for kids and families and especially for kids whove been left out or left behind in some way thats why i went to work for the childrens defense fund and learned quickly that kids with disabilities were not in our public schools back then and we worked to put together a coalition and convince congress to pass the law and boy every day i am so thankful for your former senator tom harkin who made the rights and opportunities of people with disabilities the centerpiece of his distinguished career

so thats been my mission how are we going to do more to help kids and families and so when i talk about the economy  because i think we have three big issues facing us number one we need an economy that works for everyone not just those at the top right we need to keep our country safe and we need to lead the world with strong and steady leadership in accordance with our values and we need to bring our country together we have to heal these divides

but when i think about the economy yes i want more new good jobs with rising incomes i see my friends from the laborers here we need to do work that builds our roads our bridges our ports our airports our tunnels our water systems our sewer systems this is good honorable work and boy do we have a lot of it in america we are living off the investments that our parents and our grandparents  and sometimes even greatgrandparents  made if were going to have a competitive economy we need to be building america again and we also need to do more advanced manufacturing and some of the most exciting developments i saw throughout this whole campaign were right here in iowa i saw in your community colleges some of the most advanced training that ive seen anywhere in the country and i met young men and women who were getting credentialed to be able to leave high school to get good jobs as machinists and tool and die makers and as designers using d printing i was so impressed and i think we need to do that across america and we need to bring technical education back to our high schools it was a mistake when we took vocational education out of our high schools

another way that iowa has influenced and inspired me is what youve done with clean renewable energy now it wasnt a partisan issue in iowa it really got a big boost from your wonderful former governor tom vilsack but its been continued over the years and look at the results look how much energy you are getting here in iowa from clean renewable sources most particularly wind right and look at the number of jobs  its nearly  jobs now that are related to that plus the renewable fuel standard which has motivated people to be creative about using biological material and experimenting with cellulosic material i was in the forefront of moving toward a clean renewable energy future and im excited by that

im running against someone who thinks climate change is a hoax perpetrated by the chinese i know its real i believe in science but ill tell you what else is real whats real are the economic opportunities the new jobs and businesses were going to create by assuming the responsibility to combat climate change and the young people of our country are going to lead the way to doing that now we also need to help small businesses iowa is filled with small businesses it should be easier to start one it shouldnt be so cumbersome to deal with all the multitude of regulations were going to try to streamline that process being the daughter of a small businessperson i believe in giving people the chance to have their destinies in their own hands and were going to work hard i want to be a firstclass small business president in honor of my dad and im going to do everything i can to help you get started and grow small businesses

but while were growing the economy we need to make it fairer and here are a couple of things i want to do lets raise the national minimum wage so people who work fulltime are not still in poverty ive met  you know two thirds of the people on minimum wage are women  and ive met a lot of minimumwage workers right here in iowa and across america sometimes they have to take two minimumwage jobs because a fulltime minimum wage job will earn you  at the end of a fulltime year of work we also could give the biggest boost to incomes and particularly family incomes if we finally guaranteed equal pay for womens work

and the other thing i want to do is make sure more companies adopt profitsharing so if you helped to create the profits all of you not just the top executives will be able to share in those profits you know at the debate the other night one of my wellknown supporters mark cuban was there in the front row and he really i think unsettled my opponent but ill tell you mark cubans a real billionaire who actually uses profitsharing and not only while the business is ongoing but one thing i really appreciate first business he sold he shared the profits with all of his employees  employees became millionaires because they had a boss who rewarded them for the hard work they did to make it a successful company all together

and the final point i want to make about this is about family economics you know lets tackle the cost of childcare between  and  childcare costs went up  percent incomes barely budged right so were going to increase federal investment and provide more tax relief to working families so no parent has to pay more than  percent of their income for quality childcare now if you dont have small children or grandchildren right now you might not realize the cost of childcare in a lot of states is more expensive than tuition at public colleges and universities a lot of families are just so stressed out

the other thing i want to do is to finally have our country join the rest of the advanced economies and provide paid family leave so you can take care of your family members now a lot of people think this is primarily about newborn babies adopted babies and of course thats a big part of it last year in newton a mom said to me im counting on you to know what its like trying to take care of a newborn and having to go right back to work right

thats a lot of you there you are okay and ive got to tell you i hear that all over when my granddaughter was born and i was in the hospital with my daughter i was talking to one of the nurses and i said so what is your biggest worry she said well my biggest worry is that so many of these new moms have to go right back to work right back to work but its not just for babies its for sick children sick spouses elderly members of your family who are having health problems there is nothing more important than caring for each other and i will tell you it is wrong to make it so difficult for american families

the other big expense for family economics is education every one of our children deserve good teachers and good schools no matter what zip code they live in right and we also have to make college affordable yesterday in new hampshire i was with my friend and my former opponent senator bernie sanders i am very proud of the campaign that bernie and i ran it was a campaign about issues not insults and we shared a lot of the same goals even though we have different ways of getting there and so after it was over he and i sat down and we began to hammer out some ideas about what we could do together and one of them was to make college tuition free for any family whose income is  or less and to make it debtfree for everybody else so that you only pay what you can afford to pay without going into debt

now right now iowans hold more than  billion in outstanding federal student loans an education should give you a boost not hold you back and were going to offer relief to those of you who already have debt we have  million people who already have student debt in america  of them right here in iowa were going to help you refinance it is outrageous that you can get a home mortgage at  percent a car payment at  percent and i met people in iowa who were paying    percent interest on their student loans ill tell you what i am not going to let the federal government make a profit off of lending money to young people to get their educations

and college is crucial but this is not said often enough fouryear college is not and should not be the only path to a good job that supports a middleclass life so were going to have real apprenticeships not the kind where youre told youre fired but the kind where youre told youre hired were going to help more people in high school and community college on the job learn a skill

so im excited about what we can do together i know so much of this campaign has been about you know whatever my opponent says and who he attacks and who he derides and denigrates and the list is long but its not about that its about you its about your families and your futures and each of us should be telling you what we intend to do in the job now i have this oldfashioned idea im asking for your vote i should tell you what im going to do what my plans are so tim kane and i have actually put out this little paperback book and i see somebody holding one in the front row its called not surprisingly stronger together you can pick it up at a bookstore or an airport wherever they sell paperbacks and you can see what were trying to do and where were going to get the money to pay for it and the simple answer to that is were going to make the wealthy and corporations finally pay their fair share to support america

now my friends my opponent has a very different vision for america he actually bragged about gaming the system to get out of paying his fair share in taxes maybe not paying any taxes at all and what i really find so disturbing about this is he spends all of his time just dumping on america calling us a third world country saying our military is a disaster that everything about america is in bad shape but then its probably true he hasnt paid a penny in federal taxes to actually support our military or our vets or our schools or our roads or our education systems he actually is proud of the fact that he lets everybody else pay taxes he says that makes him smart

well ill tell you what if not paying taxes makes him smart what does that make the rest of us my husband and i have put  years of our tax returns out into the public you can go and look at them and you can see that weve been blessed and were grateful for that but we have paid the highest marginal tax rates and we are glad we could because we have both benefited from this great country of ours and we want to pass that on to the next generation and the one after that

donald trump is also proud that he rooted for the housing crisis back in  and  think about that five million families lost their homes and he rooted for it because he said he could make money off of it he even said that it is just business well what kind of person believes that  that throwing people out of their homes foreclosing on them destroying the dreams of hardworking people is just business well ill tell you thats a person who should never be president because they dont understand the american dream and how hard it is for people to make it

so look i think after  thank you i think after what we saw monday night well have two more debates to be able to contrast and compare i have no idea what hes going to say the next time but you know i will spend some time preparing for it

but we cant do any of the things that i just talked about or anything that you see in our book without your help the future of our country the future of our economy and the future of our society will be on the ballot it breaks my heart to see all the meanspirited divisive bigoted things that are being said in our country we can have our differences for heaven sakes were americans thats in our dna but we should respect one another we should listen to one another thats the way were going to get things done together

and so i want you to join this campaign the election will be close but we can win iowa and were going to win on november th so if you can text join join to  or go to hillaryclintoncom and sign up to volunteer if youre not sure if youre registered see these signs i will vote iwillvotecom you can go to iwillvotecom put in your name and your address to make sure youre registered because sometimes people get dropped off the registration lists and they are surprised when they show up to vote that theyre not on it so check that out and then vote and get everybody you know to vote and i hope that a lot of you will go to vote after today after this beautiful rally were having because we will prove that we are stronger together and you know what else well prove we will prove that love trumps hate

thank you all very much"
124,"Clinton","thank you so much wow it is great to be here and thank you i am so honored to be introduced by mae wiggins and someone who made such a contribution throughout her life as a nurse to so many people and who as you can tell just feels still the pain of being rejected on the basis of her race

it took a lot of courage to come here mae thank you thank you for being with us

i also want to thank a longtime friend of mine a great activist extraordinary advocate in congress and thats us representative eleanor holmes norton i want to thank mayor allen thomas for welcoming me here and either youre all related to him or you think hes doing a good job

well i told him i want to be a good partner with mayors like him and work to help communities like greenville that are growing and striving and attracting young people he told me that the average age in the residents here in greenville was  years old

i also want to acknowledge josh stein candidate for north carolina attorney general patsy keever chair of the north carolina democratic party and state senator don davis

and i saved the best for last someone who ive gotten to know over the years someone who i really look forward to working with first thing that congressman butterfield said to me is i have to talk to you about our farmers very first thing he said proceeded to tell me that he was out on a acre sweet potato farm earlier today we talked about the damage that hurricane matthew has done the lives lost the homes lost and also the agricultural damage with all the flooding and my heart goes out to everyone who has been affected weve got to be really focused on what were going to do with this extreme weather were getting more of it in more places and im going to make that a priority for my presidency to make sure communities are well prepared theyre resilient but that we also work to try to limit the damage by taking on the challenge of climate change and changing weather patterns

and nobody knows more about weather than our farmers and i am very committed to supporting farms of all sizes but particularly small farms you know i think you said the farm you went to this morning gk was  acres you know thats a lot of land but thats not a gigantic multithousandacre farm and sometimes i think that we spend too much time and money looking after the big giant farms and not enough taking care of the smaller farms the familyowned farms farms that have been in peoples families for generations

and i will do my very best working with gk and eleanor and others in congress to focus federal attention and resources on places that need it and eastern north carolina is a place that needs it there are still too many people who feel like they have been left out and left behind and so weve got to spend time thinking about how we bring everybody along

that is my goal as your president i want to knock down the barriers that stand in the way of people and places getting ahead now also on a personal note i was in arizona last night and had a great rally there i dont know    people it was just extraordinary but i was a little anxious during my speech because the cubs were playing in the world series

and you know ive been a fan all my life started watching baseball with my dad went to wrigley field and you know its been a long time  years to win a championship and make history and i only wish that my late father and the great ernie banks mr cub could have seen it happen so last night was very special on lots of fronts and who knows maybe well see even more history made in a few days you know the last time the cubs won women couldnt vote and i think women are making up for that in this election

so thank you thank you so much for being here are you ready to vote how many  how many folks have already voted 

well thats really impressive are you ready to volunteer these last few days are you ready to elect ray cooper your governor have a governor who puts families first and your needs i know hell do a terrific job

are you ready to elect deborah ross to the united states senate she will be the independent voice that north carolina families deserve and unlike her opponent shes never been afraid to stand up to donald trump and then are you ready to elect our next president and commander in chief

you know did any of you  any of you see those debates well you know i spent fourandahalf hours standing next to donald trump proving conclusively i have the stamina to be the next president and commander in chief

but you know he kept saying things like well you know what have you done for  years well we know what hes done for  years starting with discriminating against african americans and denying them housing back in the s

i chose a different path i have spent my career fighting for kids and families and i helped to create the childrens health insurance program as first lady that now provides healthcare to  million children a year and i have to tell you i know it doesnt make headlines its not going to you know get a big twitter war going but when i travel around and shake hands like ill do after my remarks and somebody says to me the childrens health insurance program saved my son life i met a woman here in north carolina whose daughter was born deaf and the doctor said you know shes never ever going to be able to talk shes not ever going to be able to hear her mother who is determined began doing investigations she found out that there were some possible treatments but they were expensive she didnt know what she was going to do and she took her daughter to the doctor and the doctor said i just heard about this new program the childrens health insurance program maybe you can qualify for that

because its really for families that arent poor but dont have much money and a lot of families isnt it and families that dont have an employer that provides health insurance self employed independent contractors

so the mom found out about this thing call the childrens health program and low and behold they did qualify and they started the treatments for their daughter i met that young woman and she said hello to me and she talked to me she just graduated from college right here in north carolina so dont let anybody tell you it doesnt matter what you stand for what you fight for and who you are trying to help when you make your decision about who to vote for in this election

as a senator from new york i worked to rebuild new york city after the  attacks and to provide healthcare to the brave first responders who ran toward danger not away from it and many of them

 

 where you there god bless you thats another thing i meet people all over who were there and who worked there and i meet people who got sick because they worked there and as your secretary of state i traveled to  countries negotiated cease fires reduced the threat of nuclear weapons stood up for human rights and womens right and lgbt rights around the world

and everything ive done its because ive been listening to people and again i know thats not very exciting i plead to that you spend time listening not talking you know what are the poor journalists going to say uh there hillary clinton was listening again right

but ill tell you it is what motivates me to hear peoples stories to hear the tribulations and triumphs you get good ideas bring people together find common ground even with people we disagree with i disagree with people on lots of issues but i believe the only way we can get things done is to actually listen and respect each other and try to find common that common ground and that will enable us to get results for people and if you elect me next tuesday that is the kind of president ill be

and from the first day of this campaign ive been telling you what i want to do putting forth my ideas about what i think will help you i truly believe that you deserve a candidate that you can vote for not just someone to vote against and so if we are gonna make this choice we have got to be clear the positives and the negatives because one way or the other come this january america is going to have a new president and it will be either me or donald trump

and you know what else people say all the time you know i want change will come that is certain the question is what kind of change are we going to have are we going to work together to build a stronger fairer better america or are we going to fear the future and fear each other and hunker down and be paralyzed by all of our prejudices our discrimination that stops us from coming together so here is what i want you to do in these next days as you talk with people who maybe havent yet voted maybe havent yet made up their mind i want you to ask them imagine it is january th  and it is donald trump standing in front of the capital taking the oath of office

imagine what that will be like to have him in the oval office making the decisions that effect your lives and your futures imagine having a president who demeans women mocks the disabled insults african americans and latinos who pits people against each other instead of pulling them together someone who always puts himself first and doesnt care who gets hurt along the way

a president with a very thin skin who lashes out at anyone who challenges him who praises adversaries like vladimir putin and picks fights with our allies and even attacked the pope the truth is we dont have to imagine what that would be like because everything that donald trump has said and done both in his career and in his campaign is a preview of what could happen

you know as michelle obama says the presidency doesnt change who you are it reveals who you are and we have all see all we need of donald trump if donald trump were to win this election we would have a commander and chief who is completely out of his depth and whose ideas are incredibly dangerous someone who wants more countries to have nuclear weapons and who could easily insult a foreign leader and start a real war instead of just a twitter war and yet this morning in florida donald stood on a stage and said and i quote i am honored to have the greatest temperament that anyone has ever had now  he knows we can see and hear him right

this is someone who at another rally yesterday actually said out loud to himself stay on point donald stay on point his campaign probably put that in the teleprompters stay on point donald stay on point you know we have seen it over and over again we know his true self his instinct is to say whatever pops into his head no matter how wrong he is he cant help himself so is this someone we want to put in charge of our military

is this someone that we want to treat people the way he has demonstrated his disrespect throughout this campaign in a country that values religious liberty and freedom someone who would ban every muslim in the world from ever coming to our country someone who thinks the lives of black people are all crime and poverty and despair he has no idea none about the strength of the black church the vibrancy of black owned businesses the excellence of historically black colleges and universities the rise of a new generation of black activists for social justice and the success of black leaders in every field remember how he denied housing to mae brown wiggins and mae wasn not alone whenever african americans tried to rent an apartment their application was marked with a for colored

in fact donald his father fred and their entire company were sued by the justice department for discriminating against african americans and latinos in the s they settled the case but the justice department was forced to go after them again because they continued to discriminate against people of color think about that if he were to win he would be in charge of the federal housing department if he doesnt respect all americans how can we trust him to serve all americans

and then another recent example is the way donald trump treated what are called the central park five these were five black and latino kids some as young as  who it turns out were wrongly convicted of a terrible crime in new york back in 

donald trump took out fullpage ads in four newspapers calling for the death penalty for these kids nearly three decades later they were exonerated by dna evidence also someone else confessed to the crime so they were finally released from prison and justice was done but not only did donald trump refuse to apologize for calling for their execution he actually said they should still be in prison

to him those kids will still and always be guilty no matter what the evidence says do we want this man appointing judges do we want him controlling the justice department

 no

 well people who are voting for him thats what they would get he has spent this entire campaign offering a dog whistle to his most hateful supporters he retweets white supremacists and spreads racially tinged conspiracy theories and you better believe hes being heard loudly and clearly

just a few days ago and i want you to hear this because this has never happened to a major  to a nominee of a major party just a few days ago donald trump was endorsed by the official newspaper of the ku klux klan

they wrote their endorsement under the slogan of his campaign make america great again they said its about preserving white identity and they placed their faith and hope in him youve got to ask yourself do any of us  any of us who believe in our constitution who believe in the rule of law who believe that we are stronger together who believe that we want to keep moving positively toward the vision of freedom and equality set forth by our founders  do any of us have a place in trumps america

its not just about communities of color its about young people its about any of us who dont ever want us to go back to a time when you could officially discriminate where people could be intimidated that is not who america is and were not going to let it ever go back to that

but it doesnt end there youve also got to ask do women and girls have a place either imagine our daughters or in my case now my granddaughter growing up with someone who ranks women by their looks gives them numbers and brags about doing things to them without their consent just imagine what that would mean to young womens confidence and selfworth and how that will affect our young men and boys who we want to teach and nurture also to respect each other and respect girls and women as well

so this is a pretty clear choice north carolina ive said many times in this campaign that donald trump has showed us who he is now we have to decide who we are right

and across america people are doing just that  rejecting trumps dark and divisive vision for one that is much more hopeful inclusive and unifying we know that america is bighearted not smallminded we want to lift people up not tear people down

we are called  we are called in fact we are commanded those of us who are christians to love our neighbor as ourselves arent we we are not asked we are not requested we are not urged  we are commanded and we know how hard that is when i used to teach sunday school i often taught on that not because it was well known but because i think its so hard and challenging

love your neighbor as yourself well first youve got to love yourself youve got to respect yourself and then you have to love your neighbor as yourself i believe with all my heart that we are better than this and thats why i want to paint a different picture because heres what were going to do if we win this election were going to take on systemic racism with a full commitment and real follow through

we are not going to accept the status quo what happened to that church in mississippi yesterday should not be normal people painted vote trump on the side and then they set it on fire who would do that to a house of worship in america that can never be acceptable what happened in flint michigan should not be normal or acceptable  little babies toddlers children drinking water that was poisoning them and there are too many young african americans who are dying either in police incidents or from random gun violence you know their names trayvon martin eric garner sander bland key scott so many we cant accept that as normal either

so we are going to get to work im just telling you if im fortunate enough to be your president were going to roll up our sleeves and get to work because thats when were at our best solving our problems

were going to dismantle the socalled schooltoprison pipeline and replace it with a cradletocareer pipeline for every child in this country i want to make sure that our kids have the chance to thrive with good schools and good teachers no matter what zip code they live in

we will reform our criminal justice system from end to end it is wrong and i don t care whether you are black or white it is wrong that black men are far more likely to be stopped by police charged and sentenced to longer prison terms than white men for the same crimes its wrong and were going to do something about that and donald trump whenever he is face with these issues says well the answer to our problems is more law and order he does not tell you what he means by that but its kind of code for fear and division what i think we need to do is to work together to restore trust between our police and our communities

i think we are all safer when everyone has respect for the law and everyone is respected by the law and it is not all we are going to take common sense steps to reduce gun violence and save lives because right now we have got too many people who should not have excess to weapons the mentally ill felons domestic abusers terrorists you know we ca not just bow down and say theres nothing we can do commensurate with the second amendment donalds always trying to say oh you know shes going to repeal the second amendment what nonsense absolute nonsense but i believe we can respect and honor the second amendment and keep people safer by keeping guns out of the wrong hands

and were going to make significant investments in communities that have been let down and left behind congressman butterfield and i were talking about this theres some good ideas in the congress to focus on communities white black latino native american wherever they might be that have been left out we need to get the engine of economic growth going because we believe that we should have an economy that works for everyone not just those at the top we believe that we should raise the national minimum wage because anyone who works full time in poverty should not be mired and left behind and i think not only do americans deserve a raise which donald doesnt agree with and wanted to eliminate the national minimum wage i think its finally time for women to get equal pay for the work we do

i dont know about you but this is not just a womens issue im always accused by donald and his supporters that whenever i talk like that im playing the womans card well ive always said if thats playing the womans card deal me in you got that right

but i actually think im playing the family economics card because if you have a mother a wife a sister or a daughter she deserves to be paid fairly for what she does in the work force

and were going to have a big investments in new jobs infrastructure jobs our roads our bridges our tunnels our ports our airports our water systems and were going to do more to bring advanced manufacturing to inner cities and rural communities put people to work doing work that has a really productive purpose were going to invest in more clean renewable energy jobs these are jobs that cannot be exported they have to be done right here in eastern north carolina

now its fair to say ok that sounds good how are you going to do all that ok i will tell you two things first i have said and you can hold me to it i will not  will not raise taxes on anyone making less than  a year you see i come from the middle class my dad never made anything near that even in those dollars back in those days but i know that the best way to grow our economy is from the middle out and the bottom up not the top down that does not work for most americans and so secondly im going where the money is the money has gone to the wealthiest of americans and big corporations in the last  years and if you ask donald trump what is his economic policy it is to give trillions  trillions of dollars in tax cuts to himself to his family to the wealthy to corporations i just think thats a bad bad idea

were going to make the wealthy pay their fair share and were going to make sure wall street never threatens main street again and were going to make public colleges like east carolina university tuitionfree tuitionfree for working and middle class families and debt free for everybody else and if youre struggling with student debt we have a plan to ease that burden and cut your bills and get you out from under debt and were going to create  billion fund specifically aimed at supporting historically black colleges and universities

but i dont think that every young person needs to go college if you want to im going to make it affordable for you but if you also want some other way of making a good living lets bring technical education back into high schools and connect them up with community colleges and business apprenticeships

there is such a stark difference on every issue that matters between me and my opponent and im asking folks who are still making up their minds to really search your heart about what kind of country we are and what kind of future we want i just dont believe were at our best when we stoke fear about each other now that does not mean we have to agree about everything of course not but it does mean we have to be willing to listen and to come together to solve problems that affect us individually and as a society

i dont think i have all the answers i dont think anybody does when donald trump at his conventions said he alone could fix everything in america i thought about our founders meeting in philadelphia it wasnt one person creating our country it was many people working together think about every social movement every economic advance every university like this one every achievement that youve made in your own life somebody helped you you worked with somebody look at this community everybody working together making greenville really grow and thrive making this university better and better every single year that is my experience of america so heres what i hope you will do i hope you will get everybody you know and yourselves  if you havent voted yet to vote early because the others strategy is to scare people and intimidate people from going to the polls now donald trumps campaign knows that if women turn out if people of color turn out if young people turn out if people who share our vision of a positive unified country turnout theres no way he can win because that is more than half the people in america"
125,"Clinton","thank you wow thank you all woo
thank you thank you i i got to i got to say after hearing after hearing from these two extraordinary men i  i feel all fired up and ready to go for the next five days

it is so great to be back here with all of you and there are a few people in the audience that i just want to acknowledge because im delighted theyre there  us congressman david price i saw right therethank you david

state senator dan blue jr i know right there thank you danand im not sure shes still here but deborah ross who i hope is your next senator there she is

because everything pharrell and bernie just said is not only about the presidential election and whats at stake it is about whos going to represent you as your governor as your senator as members of congress and the legislature and you have some excellent candidates and we are so hopeful that you will vote for them and vote for what they represent

now i really want to thank my friend bernie sanders for everything that he has done

i  i got to serve with bernie we were colleagues in the senate i saw firsthand his commitment to the people of vermont and to the values that have guided his life and when we faced each other in the primary heres what i was so proud about we ran a campaign on the issues that matter to the american people

and i  i think because of that campaign we were able to raise a lot of the issues that you heard bernie talking about to the level that they are part of this presidential campaign and they will be part of our agenda after january th bernie

and ive got to say too this election has been a lot more fun now that were on the same side

and i want to thank bernie for everything hes done hes crisscrossing our country energizing people getting folks off the sidelines and engaged in politics and theres no question that his efforts are paying off

and what he said at the beginning of his remarks is absolutely true my name may be on the ballot but it is not about me its not about my opponent its not about bernie its not about david or deborah it is about you and your lives and what were going to do together

now bernie and i have already worked weve worked on the plan that he told you about to make college tuitionfree for the middleclass for working families for poor kids and debtfree for everyone

because as bernie said earlier this year when people who care about progressive causes stand together we win and then we can get to work on making those causes into realities for the lives of our people so i am proud to be here with you and i am so excited about  of the election about everything that were going to do together

and im especially pleased to have pharrell here

now every time i see him which is not often enough we always have a good conversation like we did before this event he always gets you to think not only is he a worldclass talent but he is a passionate advocate for issues that are too often overlooked and ignored he wants to  and im going to do everything i can help him  to deliver  giving kids who are at risk access to educational and arts programs that they deserve to have just as much as any other child

so tell me this tell me this north carolina tell me north carolina are you really really really happy that were here tonight

well we sure are theres nowhere wed rather benow let me ask you this how many of you have already votedwell i hope youre going to bring more people to vote as well rightare you ready to volunteer

we can all use you in these last days are you ready to elect roy cooper

well im glad to hear that because its time you had a governor who puts families first not radical ideologyand i love seeing our educators stand up and applaud because you need a governor who actually cares about the education of the children of north carolina

now are you ready to elect deborah ross to the united states senate ill tell you  ill tell you deborah and her race are the talk of everywhere people know she will be an independent voice for north carolina families that she will represent you with integrity and excellence and unlike her opponent shes never been afraid to stand up to donald trump

are you ready now to choose our next president and commanderin chief

well im  im excited did any of you see the debateswell you know theres several  theres several notable aspects of those debates

i mean one is the very fact that i stood on the stage for four and a half hours with my opponent proving once and for all i have the stamina to be president and commanderinchief

but you know  but you know he  he also kept saying like oh well you know what have you done for the last  years and you know occasionally i would interject and say what i had done

and today in greenville we had a perfect comparison i started my career fighting for children and families with the childrens defense fund when i got right out of law school in the s

i went to south carolina to gather evidence to stop the government in south carolina for  from putting young men teenagers in jails with adults i went to alabama undercover to gather information about segregated academies to deprive them of taxexempt status which they did not deserve

i went doortodoor in new bedford massachusetts gathering information to make the case that every child in america including children with disabilities should have the right to a public school education

and as we heard this morning from a  just a wonderful distinguished older woman by the name of mae wiggins who came all the way down to tell her story she was a nurse in new york city back in the s excited about being a young nurse getting her career off to a start and she was looking for a place to live and she had a budget like everybody does and she found what she thought would be the perfect place it was within her budget it was close to work

she went to apply for an apartment it was a new building  brand new building it wasnt even totally finished yet she went into the little office and asked for an application and they said oh we dont have any apartments she said but i saw the advertisement well we have no apartments left

well she thought that was pretty peculiar and so she decided to do a little investigation and she found out that all of her african american friends who had gone to that apartment run by donald trump and his father fred had been told there were no apartments

so she had the gumption to go and make a complaint which led to the justice department suing them for discrimination they settled the suit but then they had to come back a year later and sue them again because they were still discriminating

so when you hear as bernie so powerfully said at the end of his remarks that we are standing against the possibility of returning and normalizing discrimination take it seriously my friends because it truly is  it truly is at stake in this election

and i was also very very grateful i had a role in helping to create the childrens health insurance program as first lady and let me tell you one of the great  one of the great honors as i travel across the country is meeting young people who are the beneficiaries or meeting their families

i met a woman here in north carolina who told her story and we actually recorded it because all of us were so moved by what she had to say when her baby was born her daughter she was deaf and the doctors all said shell never  shell never communicate so she cannot learn to speak so you need to teach her sign language

and the mom did all this research and concluded that there were some treatments that might help her daughter but she didnt have that kind of money they didnt have that kind of insurance and she was telling her doctor she didnt know what to do and the doctor just serendipitously said you know theres this new program its called the childrens health insurance program its for people who are not poor but they dont make enough money to afford that kind of insurance and they dont work for an employer who provides it you should look into it and she did and that began the process of her getting the treatment that her daughter needed

and when i met the mother i also met the daughter right here i talked with her she told me how proud she was because she had just graduated from college george washington university

so yes you know i do sweat the details and i do have a lot of plans tim kaine and i put a whole book out called stronger together telling you exactly what were going to try to do if were fortunate enough to be president and vice president because i actually think its important for you to know what were going to do together

and as your as a senator i helped to rebuild new york city after  and provided health care to our brave first responders as your secretary of state i traveled to  countries negotiated ceasefires reduced the threat of nuclear weapons stood up for human rights and womens rights and lgbt rights all around the world

and you know everything ive done started by listening to people listening to hear your stories what youre worried about and then working to bring people together to find common ground even with people who disagreed with me on lots of issues

you know when i was first lady i had a great commitment to kids in foster care and i wanted to improve our foster care and adoption laws and i was looking for some republican to work with me and i found one because i did my research and found out that one of the most partisan republicans congressman tom delay from texas had a heart for children in foster care he and his wife had fostered children and i called him up

i said congressman would you work with me to change the laws on foster care and adoption there was a silence he said well what do you want me to do i said well come to the white house come to a meeting well sit down and figure out what we can do and we did and i meet those kids and i meet those families kids who were taken out of foster care and given the chance to have a loving permanent family for the first time

now im telling you this because i really believe thats the only way were going to get things done and if you elect me next tuesday that is the kind of president i will be

so let me just mention a few of the ideas that weve been putting forward to help you and your families get ahead and stay ahead because i truly believe you need a candidate you can vote for not just someone to vote against

but as youre making this choice we need to be clear about what the choice is because come january th america will have a new president it will either be me or my opponent

now i think its fair to say things are going to change change is part of life that much is certain the question is what kind of change are we going to see are we going to build a stronger fairer better america or are we going to fear each other and fear our future

i want you just to imagine imagine the different kinds of futures that are available depending upon whos elected on january th because by imagining it i want you to think about every issue you care about everything that is dear to you everything that you heard from pharrell and from bernie

its hard for me to imagine that we would have a president who has demeaned women mocked the disabled insulted africanamericans and latinos pitted people against each other instead of bringing them together that is unfortunately though what we have seen in this campaign what we have seen whats been said and how distressful its been

i know there are a lot of people who are upset about whats going on in this campaign arent there people come and talk to me ive had people say that they cant sleep that their stomachs are bothering them they have headaches and i think thats an important signal because this is a big decision and as michelle obama has said the presidency doesnt change you  who you are it reveals who you are

and i think its fair to say that my opponent has already revealed who he is and he wants to ban every muslim in the world from coming to the united states our country is founded on religious freedom it is one of the most important building blocks of our democracy

he has said that he thinks the lives of black people are all crime and poverty and despair he has no idea  no idea about the strength of the black church the vibrancy of blackowned businesses the excellence of historically black colleges and universities

he seems not to recognize the rise of a new generation of black activists for social justice and the success of black leaders in every field

and we saw that again in the way he treated the central park five these were five black and latino kids some as young as  who were wrongly convicted of a terrible crime in new york city back in  donald trump took out fullpage ads in four newspapers calling for the death penalty for these kids nearly three decades later they were exonerated by dna evidence

and in addition someone else confessed to the crime so they were finally released from prison but not only did trump refuse to apologize for what he had said about them and even calling for their executions he actually said they should still be in prison evidence didnt matter the law didnt matter to him those kids would always be guilty

so think about it if he wants to keep exonerated people in jail how can we trust him to fight for the rule of justice and fairness and criminal justice reform in america

do we want him appointing our judges

 no

 do we want him controlling the justice department

 no

 well ive said many times he has shown us who he is now it is up to us to decide who we are and right now people across our country are coming together to do just that they are rejecting the dark and divisive vision for one that is more hopeful and inclusive we know that america is bighearted not smallminded we want to lift people up not tear each other down

and thats why i do believe we are stronger together so let me paint you a different picture heres what were going to do together were going to take on systemic racism with a full commitment and real followthrough because we refuse to accept as normal some of what were seeing across america

what happened to that church in mississippi yesterday should not have happened and it should never be accepted people painted the words vote trump on the side and then set it on fire who would do that who would do that to a place of worship where people seek solace that can never be normal it can never be acceptable

what happened in flint michigan as bernie said can never be normal can never be acceptable

little children drinking and bathing in poisoned water that will affect their health for years to come

and then we know dont we too many young africanamericans are dying in police incidents or because of gun violence

we know their names trayvon martin and eric garner and sandra bland and keith scott and so many others we have got to face this and were going to get to work to do just that we are going to  we are going to dismantle the socalled schooltoprison pipeline and were going to replace it with a cradletocollege pipeline

and were going to start with our youngest kids and their families to give them the support that they need and were going to take a hard look at what we need to do to make sure every child has the chance to attend good schools with good teachers no matter what their zip code is

and we will reform our criminal justice system from endtoend it is wrong my friends that black men are far more likely to be stopped by police charged and sentenced to longer prison terms than white men for the same offenses

when i  when i launched this campaign back in april of  the very first speech i gave was on the topic of criminal justice reform i said then and i have repeated it throughout this campaign we must end the era of mass incarceration

too many families have been broken up too many communities have been so badly affected we have to reform these mandatory minimums and sentencing we have to ban the box so people who have served their time can get a real chance at a good job and a fresh start

and we have to restore trust between police and communities we are all safer when everyone has respect for the law and everyone is respected by the law

this is important of course to families and communities but it is important to all of us this is about who we are as a country about whether we really are a nation that believes in freedom and justice for all too often despite the progress weve made we fall short of that goal and we have to be honest about it

i am determined to make this one of the most important projects of my presidency and i hope all of you will join me in doing that

and i have to say  i have to say that is only part of what must be done because the leading cause of death for young africanamerican men more than the next nine causes

we have  people a year dying from guns i just cannot tolerate this any longer i have met the families of those who have lost loved ones who have lost the first graders in sandy hook the bible study churchgoers in charleston the clubgoers in orlando the moviegoers in aurora colorado people going about their lives being cut down and cut senselessly short we have to take steps to reduce gun violence and i know we can do that because the vast majority of americans agree something must be done and a very big majority of gun owners agree as well

and weve got to make investments in those communities that are struggling especially communities of color

when i was in eastern north carolina today and i was talking to people there who had been devastated by hurricane matthew people who didnt have very much to start with who lost everything farmers with   acres growing sweet potatoes wiped out weve got to help everybody get ahead

i believe that the economy must work for everyone not just those at the top and i think hardworking americans deserve a raise and women deserve equal pay

so how are we going to do this well were going to go where the money is just as bernie said were going to make the wealthy pay their fair share and make sure wall street never threatens main street again

and i cant wait to work with bernie to make public colleges and universities like nc state right here at raleigh tuitionfree

i know that this is another issue pharrell feels passionately about as well if youre struggling with student debt were going to cut that and help you pay it back and get out from under it

and in my plan is a  billion fund specifically aimed at supporting historically black colleges and universities  schools like shaw and saint augustine  because you know they produce some of the finest leaders in our country and i want to make sure they keep doing that vital work

so we could go on all night i mean bernie and i could really keep you here until breakfast because we get excited about what we can do but of course we cant do anything if you dont get out and vote and get everybody you know to vote

this is going to be one of the most consequential elections in our countrys history you know that because we are at a crossroads its not just who my opponent is pharrell is right we dont even have to mention his name very much right its not just about him although there are some special features that certainly raise deep concerns its about who we are its about what we want what were going to do to make our mark on our country at this time in our history

i believe  i believe americas best days are still ahead of us if we do what were supposed to do

every social movement every economic advance has only come about because people were willing to work and sacrifice and keep pushing forward in the face of adversity its not easy it wasnt easy to get the vote for women it wasnt easy to have the final efforts made to ensure that the civil rights act was enforced it wasnt easy because there are powerful interests still trying to push us back and push us down

and right now you know because in this state a lot of effort was put into trying to suppress the vote right

and some people got discouraged about that ive met some people who say well you know i dont even know what they want what kind of identification it gets a little discouraging you cannot get discouraged do not grow weary while doing good right

it is now our turn  our turn to stand up to people like your governor and your legislature who wanted to shut you down and push you back because we are fundamentally a good nation and we need to make sure we deliver on that promise

and in this election president obamas entire legacy is on the line everything that he has worked so hard to do against implacable opposition as the president said yesterday everything weve done is dependent upon him being able to pass the baton to somebody who believes in the same things he believes in

so i got to tell you ive told the president im ready to take the baton but hes going to have to bend over because hes a lot taller than i am

but im not just taking it all of us are taking it we are ready to grab that baton to defend and build upon the progress of his presidency and that is why everyone must vote early vote and vote on tuesday if you cant get to early voteand listen to this more than two million right here in north carolina have already voted

so make no mistake about it you can make the difference not only in who you elect but in the agenda that those people will then get to work on i want you to hold me accountable i want you to be my partners but i cant do any of this

you know when i was with our wonderful first lady last week she reminded she reminded the big crowd we had in winstonsalem that president obama in  won this state by about  votes

if you break that down you know what the difference between winning and losing is roughly two votes per precinct so dont let anybody tell you their vote doesnt matter youve got to get everyone you know to come out and vote you can vote early through this saturday november th if you dont know where to vote go to iwillvotecom to confirm your voting location because the best way to repudiate the bigotry and the bluster and the bullying and the hateful rhetoric and discrimination is to show up with the biggest turnout in american history

and then that will be the story of this election lets make that one for the history books please be part of what were doing in these next days and lets make sure that we not only have a future we can believe in but one we can help create together and demonstrate once and for all that love trumps hate

thank you all"
126,"Clinton","hello grand valley thank you thank you
it is great to be back in western michigan thank you are there any lakers here

oh my gosh i am so thrilled to be here i want to thank the president of this great university tom haas the faculty the staff the students i want to thank brandon dillon the chair of the michigan democratic party and i especially really want to thank you for sending debbie stabenow to the united states senate

i have also the great personal experience and privilege of having worked with debbie gotten to know her become a friend of hers and i am so excited at the possibility that ill be able to work with her again but i want you to know this  and i really really hope youll tell folks because there is no more dedicated effective member of the united states senate than debbie stabenow

she fights for all of you every day but she does it with that smile that never leaves her face and she brings people together who are on opposite sides of issues because she just keeps talking and dont we need more of that in washington where people actually talk and listen to each other so its wonderful to be with all of you and to be introduced by debbie

are you ready to vote tomorrow michigan are you ready to help get your friends to vote tomorrow that is clearly the right answer because we have a really important election tomorrow

the choice in this election could not be clearer and i know that for many people youve gone back and forth youve thought about what to do and i really respect that but let me say this let me say this this election is basically between division and unity in our country

its between strong and steady leadership or a loose cannon who could put everything at risk it is between an economy that works for everyone or one that is even more stacked for those at the top and i want each and every one of you to be thinking through about all the issues that you care about because although my name and my opponents name will be on the ballot those issues and those values are on the ballot as well

and as you think about what you care about and what you want your future to look like you have to recognize this is a consequential election i have been privileged to know a lot of our presidents over the past decades and people who ran for president i was privileged to know as a college student gerald ford

in fact i had an internship with the house republican conference committee which he headed after my junior year in college so when i say ive gotten to know a lot of our presidents and people whove run for president it goes back a ways and heres what i want you to understand i didnt agree with everything they did or said even the democrats we had differences and politics and policies and sometimes on principle but i never doubted i never doubted that they were fit to serve as our president and commanderinchief

thats why this election is so different and its why so many republicans have spoken out to endorse me and support me and who have taken very courageous stands against the nominee of their own party because they believe that we must put country ahead of party when it comes to this election

i was at kent state in ohio last week and i was introduced by a gentleman by the name of bruce blair and mr blair had served in the air force he was a young officer assigned to be what was called a launch officer that meant he served his time every day sitting in a bunker where the controls for launching nuclear weapons were housed and his job  imagine the responsibility a young air force officer in his twenties waiting to hear whether or not an order is given for him to launch nuclear weapons

and bruce blair explained that there is no appeal from a presidents order to do that the joint chiefs of our military forces cant say no dont do it theres no veto from congress or anyone else and the time between the order being given and the actual launch is four minutes

so after watching this election mr blair began contacting others who had served in this incredibly responsible position to share his concerns about what he was hearing and seeing and several dozen of them  id never met them before  several dozen of them wrote a letter explaining why they could never support donald trump to be our commanderinchief

the awesome responsibility that is housed in one person is something i want you to think about between now and the time you vote because i will pledge to you that i will exercise the greatest care and responsibility in all of the powers invested in the office of the presidency

i also want to pose to you a contrast in visions did any of you see the debates first of all i did stand for four and a half hours with donald trump on the stage proving conclusively i have the stamina to be president

but i have to say in addition to that there were so many things that he said that of course i sometimes was surprised by but the theme that ran through much of his rhetoric was the presentation of a dark and divisive vision for america now i have to tell you i know weve got problems ive spent  months traveling around our country talking to  by now  hundreds and hundreds of thousands of people hearing whats on peoples minds weve got challenges but americas always had challenges and since when do we become pessimistic and not able to think about what we can do to overcome those challenges and solve those problems together

i often didnt recognize the country that donald trump was describing because from my perspective looking back at our history we have a tremendous opportunity ahead of us and you can vote for a hopeful inclusive bighearted america that will set the stage for an even better future

and i want to say especially to the students who are here  i really believe that americas best days are still ahead of us if we reach for them together

make no mistake our core values are being tested in this election but my faith in our future has never been stronger last night in manchester new hampshire i was introduced by mr khizr khan

some of you know or remember that his son captain khan serving in the united states army was killed serving in iraq and like at the democratic convention this summer he spoke powerfully about what america means to him and how we have to defend our values and our constitution that are the envy of the rest of the world people look at us with yearning they see that we are a beacon of freedom hope and opportunity for people right here at home

when i heard mr khan speak at the convention and i heard him again last night i was so touched because what he said exhibited a love of our country he said that when he started hearing donald trump speak and all of the things he said about so many people not only muslims but africanamericans and latinos and pows and women and so many people  when he heard it he couldnt help but think as he walked around his house  he has a room where his sons medals  he got the bronze star he got the purple heart  the flag that was draped on his coffin  is respectfully presented in the box that he was given it in and he thought to himself would there be any room for my son in donald trumps america

think about that for a minute because every single one of us has something to contribute to this great country we are already great but we can be greater and we will be greater

i love our country and i believe in the american people and i know there is nothing we cant do when we make up our minds throughout our history generations of americans have risen together to meet the tests of their time they defended democracy they built the greatest middle class the world has ever known they marched for civil rights and voting rights for workers rights and union rights for lgbt rights rights for people with disabilities

and now now weve got to come together and we have to prove we can meet the challenges of our time weve got to get the economy working for everybody not just those at the top

if you believe as i do that america thrives when the middle class thrives then you have to vote tomorrow

we are going to make the biggest investment in good paying jobs since world war ii jobs in infrastructure our roads our bridges our tunnels our ports our airports our water systems

these are jobs we need doing in american and these are jobs that cannot be exported theyve got to be done right here in michigan and across our country

and we are going to invest in new jobs in advanced manufacturing i am not one of these folks who think we just cant make it in america anymore and ill tell you why because if we have a plan and we actually commit to fulfilling that plan we can lead the world in precision machining in d printing were not competing for lowwage jobs we are competing with germany for high manufacturing high skilled jobs

and we are going to have clean renewable energy jobs as a way to fight climate change as you heard my opponent chose to make many of his products overseas and as i pointed out in the last debate he buys cheap chinese steel and aluminum instead of good american steel made by american steel workers

hes gone all over this country and hes gone all over michigan talking about how hes gonna really get more jobs and hes going to bring back what used to be there well ill tell you what look at his record dont just listen to his rhetoric

because i have a different idea were going to invest in america again and for everybody who is frustrated and anxious and maybe even angry because they feel left out left behind that americas not working the way it should  i understand that i understand that i represented upstate new york for eight years and i saw first hand a lot of the loss of jobs and factories picking up and moving out

but i also realized that anger is not a plan youve got to come together and figure out what is it were gonna do to bring new jobs back and create more opportunity for people

and ill just tell you that i believe that weve got to defend the american workers right to organize and bargain for better wages and benefits

were gonna get incomes rising here in western michigan and across this state and were also gonna do more to help small business my dad was a small businessman he worked really hard he ran a printing plant that printed fabrics for draperies and i would from time to time help him out you take a silkscreen you put it down on the long table you pour the paint in you do the squeegee you pick it up  it wasnt automated we were the automaters  and youd go all the way down to one table youd go to the other table so i know how hard people in small business work

and i also know something else donald trump made a lot of money off the backs of small business people and contractors by stiffing them and refusing to pay his bills and i have said i am sure glad my dad never got a contract from donald trump because we could not have afforded that

but its not just enough to grow the economy we have to make it fairer and if you believe we need a fairer economy then you have to vote i think the best antidote for whatever ails a person is a good job i believe in hard work thats how i was raised but i also believe that if you work hard and you work full time you shouldnt still be in poverty at the end of the year and im gonna raise the national minimum wage

and one of the things ive heard all over america especially from young families really from all families but particularly young families is how hard it is to do so many of the things that are expected  like where do you find affordable quality childcare in lots of states its more expensive than college tuition were gonna get the cost of childcare down were going to have a paid family leave program so that when you have a sick relative or youre sick you wont lose your job

i saw the folks over there holding up the tim kaine sign and i really appreciate that thank you thank you i got to tell you  tim and i were in pittsburgh last month with a big crowd and we couldnt get everybody in like today so tim went out to say hello to people and he saw a woman holding a baby probably about three years old and he stopped to talk to her and she said i came here because i wanted to tell you and to tell hillary clinton what happened to me she said that i had my baby it was a hard labor and delivery and i needed some time off and i called by boss and said the doctors want me to take some time off and so i wont be in for  i think she said two weeks  and they said ok youre fired

that is legal in america still and what that does is to say that  wait a minute do we really value children do we really value families and weve got to have a system that is fair to employers and fair to employees because you got to be able to balance work and family in todays america

and then finally i think it is way past time to guarantee equal pay for womens work

and you know i gotta say  this always gets a huge round of applause as you can tell  but this is not just a womans issue its a family issue if you have a wife a mother a sister a daughter whos in the work force you want her to be paid what she deserves to be paid to help you and your family

just about everything ive said so far my opponent disagrees with and whenever i talk about affordable childcare and paid family leave and equal pay  he says im playing the womans card and you know what i say if thats the case then deal me in

and heres what else i want you to know its fair to ask how are you going to pay for that thats not only fair thats necessary to ask because i want to be a good steward of your tax dollars just as i expect youre a good steward of your family budget i have proposed a very simple formula i will not raise taxes on anyone making less than  a year

and for small businesses were gonna cut your taxes because i know a lot of small businesses need that kind of tax relief so instead were going where the money is to the millionaires and the billionaires and the big corporations

and that is in stark contrast to what donald trump has proposed his whole economic plan is cut trillions of dollars in taxes from millionaires and billionaires and corporations that is trickledown economics on steroids i profoundly disagree i think the way you build an economy is from the middle out and the bottom up not from the top down

when you think about it donald hasnt paid anything for  years hes paid zero to support our military our vets pell grants for students here at grand valley our highways  and i am still pondering i am just pondering how anybody can lose a billion dollars in one year

especially when youre running casinos i do not understand that but that will be one of the mysteries in this campaign because hes not going to release his tax returns now and the time you start voting and that sort of suggests there must be something really terrible in those tax returns because everybody else for more than  years has released them

so well still wonder but what we know is his economic approach will cost us jobs not create jobs and we cant afford that we need to keep building we have recovered from the worst financial crash since the great depression but were not where we need to be yet the last thing we need is a failed economic policy coming back in and pushing us back down and depriving people of the jobs that we want to create

and if you believe all of our kids should have good schools and good teachers no matter what zip code they live in then you have to vote

and if you believe college should be affordable you have to vote ive got to say i am proud of the campaign that bernie sanders and i ran it was a campaign about ideas and issues not insults and when it was over we actually got together what a novel idea we wanted to figure out how we can work together to actually produce on some of the goals that we both shared so bernie and i worked on this plan together

public colleges and universities should be tuitionfree for everyone who makes less than a  a year and they should be debtfree for everyone else because nobody should go into debt and if you have gone into debt if youre among the millions of americans who are struggling  as i see some hands pointing in the air  paying back your student debt we are going to help you pay it down and pay it off

it makes no sense at all we have interest rates that are really low right now buy a car for what  or  percent you can buy a house for  percent there are so many people who are paying    higher     percent interest  how much twelve point seven fourteen point one i got to tell you friends that is outrageous the federal government should not be making money off of sending kids to college

i cant wait to roll up my sleeves with debbie and bernie and were gonna get to work right after this election if i am fortunate enough to win

look working for children and families has been the cause of my life but its never been more important than it is right now and that has to be our mission together doing all we can to help every american and especially every young american and every child in america to have the chance to live up to their godgiven potential i will wake up every single day in the white house trying to figure out what i can do to make that a reality for you

so after tomorrow the work will begin and one of the highest priorities that i feel an obligation to address is how we bring our country together a lot of people say weve got to heal our country or as the bible says repair the breach because we have so much divisiveness right now weve got to start listening to each other respecting each other i know it is unusual i admit for somebody running for president especially the day before an election but ive been saying this for months to say that we need more of two things right now

we need more love and kindness in america

i dont know about you i dont know about you but i bet everyone of us has received a kindness and maybe i hope weve all extended one i am standing here today because my mother who was abandoned by her parents rejected by her grandparents went to work at the age of  as a maid and a babysitter was extended kindness not by those who should have loved her but by others the first grade teacher who saw she had nothing to eat at lunch who began bringing extra food the woman whose house she went to work in who knew that my mother wanted to go to high school she would have been a freshman in high school when she had to leave her grandparents home and she got this job and that woman said i know you want to go to high school if you get up early and you get your chores done you can go to high school but youll have to come back because well need you in the late afternoon

now that may sound harsh to say to a year old but to my mother it was a gift i tell you this because we all have to start thinking about how we want to be treated and what that means about how we treat others

theres a version of the golden rule in every major religion and it is a reminder that every one of us gets knocked down the question as my mother would say is are you gonna get back up and for people in our country who feel like theyve been knocked down and nobody cares nobodys paying attention heres what i want you to know if you give me the honor of being your president im gonna do everything i can to get this country and everybody in it back up on our feet moving forward together

because i want to be a president for all americans

democrats republicans independents not just the people who support me everybody in this country because i believe with all my heart each of us has a role to play in building a better future so lets take that first step tomorrow if you dont know where youre supposed to vote go to iwillvotecom  you can get all the information you need if you want to help us bringing out the vote here in western michigan in the last   hours you can still sign up to volunteer go to hillaryclintoncom or you can text join or stop by one of our offices we would be really excited to see you because when your kids and grandkids ask what you did in  when everything was on the line i hope youll be able to say that you voted for a better stronger fairer america

an america where we build bridges not wallsand an america where we prove that yes love trumps hate

thank you all so much"
127,"Clinton","thank you thank you all hello everyone its great to be here at unc greensboro i want to thank martha for that wonderful introduction it means so much to have her here along with her wonderful daughter sara and her mother barbara and the story she told is really one that motivates me every day because it is kids like sara that led me to politics in the first place to try to make our country and our world better for them so to see sara grown up and thriving is very special and your whole familys support really means the world to me thank you martha sara barbara
i have to say its great to be back on the campaign trail as you may know i recently had a cough that turned out to be pneumonia i tried to power through it but even i had to admit that maybe a few days of rest would do me good and im not great at taking it easy even under ordinary circumstances but with just two months to go until election day sitting at home was pretty much the last place i wanted to be

but it turns out having a few days to myself was actually a gift i talked with some old friends i spent time with our very sweet dogs i did some thinking the campaign trail doesnt really encourage reflection and its important to sit with your thoughts every now and then and that did help me reconnect with what this whole campaign is about

people like me  were lucky when im under the weather  now i just want to have a conversation and other people can wave their arms and their signs but i want you to think with me for a minute about how i certainly feel lucky when im under the weather i can afford to take a few days off millions of americans cant they either go to work sick or they lose a paycheck dont they

lots of americans still dont even have insurance or they do but its too expensive for them to actually use so they toss back some tylenols they chug orange juice and they hope that the cough or the virus goes away on its own

lots of working parents cant afford childcare which in many states costs as much as college tuition so for millions of moms and dads if they get sick theres no backup theyre on their own arent they

thats the story for too many people still in america when illness strikes or an accident happens you feel youre on your own if you lose your job or cant afford college youre on your own if your aging parent starts needing more help and you dont know what to do youre on your own

life events like these are catastrophic for some families but mere bumps in the road for others i have met so many people living on a razors edge one illness away from losing their job one paycheck away from losing their home and that goes against everything we stand for as americans because some things should not come down to luck some things should be within reach for everyone no matter what like financial security like affordable health care like the peace of mind that comes with knowing that if something goes wrong your family will be okay and above all the knowledge that no matter what your president is fighting for you and will always have your back

that right there thats why i got into this race i am running for everyone working hard to support their families everyone whos been knocked down but gets back up the factory workers on their feet all day and the nurses looking after patients all night im running for young people like so many of you here who dream of changing our world for the better and for all the parents and grandparents supporting those dreams by dedicating every dollar they can spare to your education

im running for the lgbt teenager here in north carolina who sees your governor sign a bill legalizing discrimination and suddenly feels like a secondclass citizen and if anyone wonders what the costs of discrimination are just ask the people and businesses of north carolina look at whats happening with the ncaa and the acc this is where bigotry leads and we cant afford it  not here not anywhere else in america

im running for women like janelle turner back in may of last year janelle was diagnosed with breast cancer she went through nearly six months of very tough treatments last october she brought her eightyearold daughter to one of our rallies in iowa and they made a huge sign that read thirteenth chemo yesterday three more hear me roar wouldnt you want to meet the woman behind that sign well i sure did so we got talking and weve stayed in touch she keeps promising me shell see me at the inauguration and i tell her ill keep working to get there but shed better be there too

im running for her and all the mothers and fathers trying to get and stay healthy so they can be there for their kids but perhaps most of all im running for those kids standing up for children has been the work of my life as a lawyer with the childrens defense fund as first lady in arkansas in the white house as a senator i have fought for kids housed in adult jails kids who have been neglected and abused kids who couldnt get health insurance because of preexisting conditions kids with disabilities so they could go to school you heard today from someone ive known for a long time now grown up and a lovely young woman anastasia somoza i learned from my family and my methodist faith that we are each called to do all the good we can for all the people we can for however long we can and to me that means making sure all our children have the chance to live up to their godgiven potentials

so when i meet a little girl in nevada terrified that her parents are going to be deported it hits me right in the gut when i meet a little boy in flint michigan who cant drink the water at home or in school because its poisoned with lead that gets me going all i want to do is get to work making things better for them

thats why i care so much about national security too i want to give our kids a safer world to me that means a world with strong allies more friends fewer enemies and fewer nuclear weapons it also means leading the fight against climate change so we can leave our kids a health planet

my opponent in this race disagrees with me on every one of these fronts just a few days ago he said that if another countrys troops taunted ours  not fired at them but taunted them just taunts  hed responded  he would respond by blowing them out of the water he would start a war over that that is just one more reason my friends why the stakes in this election are as high as any in our lifetimes

ive been involved in politics in one way or another for many years it is not an easy business it can get rough and ive built up some defenses when it comes to public service im better at the service part than the public part but this is why i do it and this is who im in it for to make life better for children and families and thats what this race has always been about for me

well now were in the final stretch there are just  days till election day just  days till the most consequential vote of our lifetimes and just a little more than a month until early voting starts here in north carolina lets make these days count particularly here because you know what your governor and legislature tried to do  make it harder for young people to vote harder for people of color harder for people with disabilities harder for the elderly there cant be any more motivation than that to make sure every young person every person of color every person with a disability every older person turns out and votes

so in these final days lets try to tune out all the chatter and the nonstop analysis that doesnt often have much to do with what the next president has to do to create good jobs to create opportunity to make it possible for every young person to afford to go to college or get the skills that you need for the jobs of the future lets talk about what really matters

and heres my promise to you im going to close my campaign the way i began my career and the way i will serve as your president should you give me that great honor  focused on opportunities for kids and fairness for families

next week ill go to philadelphia to talk about challenges facing our young people in florida to focus on building an economy that welcomes everyones contributions including people with disabilities then ill be back here in north carolina to meet with more working families from now until november th everywhere i go im going to talk about my ideas for our country my campaign has rolled out detailed plans in  different policy areas  yes somebody actually counted everything from reining in wall street to creating goodpaying jobs to fighting alzheimers to supporting people with autism you see i have this oldfashioned notion that if youre running for president you should say what you plan to do how youre going to get it done and how youre going to pay for it you can read it all on my website hillaryclintoncom we even put it in a new book called you guessed it stronger together get a copy of it because it tells you everything tim kaine and i intend to do

now like a lot of women i have a tendency to overprepare i sweat the details whether were talking about the exact level of lead in the water in flint or how many north carolina kids are in early enrichment programs or the precise interest rate on your student loans right down to the decimal because you know what its not a detail if its your kid its not a detail if its your family its a big deal and it should be a big deal to your president

now i confess ill never be the showman my opponent is and thats okay with me just look at  look at the show he put on with dr oz today but i am going to deliver for you and your family just like i did for sarah all those years ago with the childrens health insurance program that gave her the chance to be the extraordinary young woman she is and ill tell you something else people accuse me of all kinds of things you probably have seen that but nobody ever accuses me of quitting and i will never give up ill never walk away no matter how tough the going gets im actually asking americans to hold me accountable for my ideas and hold my opponent accountable for his

we dont need a president who says the minimum wage is too high we need a president who knows that americans deserve a raise to get to a living wage we dont need a president who wants to take away peoples health coverage we need a president who wants everyone to have quality affordable health care and we dont need a president who apparently thinks only married people deserve paid leave and only mothers stay home with kids we dont need someone who rushes out a halfbaked plan just weeks before an election after decades of ignoring or putting down working moms we need a president who has spent years fighting for these issues who has a plan to support all families in all their various shapes ask yourself which candidate you can count on to be on your side respect your family stand up and fight for you and your kids

that is who you should vote for on november th because as michelle obama said in her fabulous speech at the democratic convention when we go to the polls this november the real choice isnt between democrat or republican its about who will have the power to shape our children for the next four years of their lives its also about the kind of country we want to be and what we want to leave behind for future generations people have to decide are we going to make our economy work for everyone or just those at the top are we going to bring people together or pit americans against each other and rip our country apart are we going to work with our allies to keep us safe or are we going to put a loose cannon in charge who would risk everything generations of americans have worked so hard to build

now i have a lot of confidence in the american people and in our country my opponent keeps running us down saying were weak a disaster an embarrassment every time he says things like that i think about janelle and her strength in the face of cancer or martha and sarah in the face of their health challenges and that little boy in flint who gets up every day and goes to school even though he cant drink the water see my opponent has america all wrong theres nothing we cant do when we come together as one nation set big goals and pursue them

and the american dream  the american dream is big enough for everyone to share in its promise so if you believe the minimum wage should be a living wage that no one who works fulltime should have to raise their child in poverty join us if you believe that every man woman and child in america has the right to affordable health care and women should be free to make our own health decisions join us if you believe  if you believe your working mother wife sister or daughter deserves equal pay then join us get involved these last  days go to hillaryclintoncom or text join join to  we need volunteers right here in north carolina we cant do this without you

and remember the presidential race isnt the only one this fall weve got a lot of important statewide races lets come together and send deborah ross to represent the people in the senate starting on october th you can register and vote early at the same time at any onestop early voting site in your county so the heat is on spread the word tell your friends your family your neighbors if you share our vision for americas future come be part of helping us shape it we do not have a minute to lose

we have so many blessings now its our job to deliver on those and to make sure every single person and particularly every child no matter who they are what they look like or who they love is part of the american dream now and way into the future let that be our message let that be our mission please come out and help us fight fight for you fight for our children fight for our families lets make america all that it should be thank you and god bless you"
128,"Clinton","hello broward countywhoa it is so great to be back in florida there are just  days two weeks from today
the most important election in our lifetimes im so grateful to see all of you and i want to thank the elected officials who are here congresswoman debbie wassermanschult

congressman alcee hastings congressman ted deutch commissioner mark bogen and others who are here along with senator bill nelsons wonderful wife grace nelson so we are glad you are all here with me

and i got to tell you i was thrilled to be introduced by the person i hope will be the next senator from the great state of florida congressman patrick murphyyou know i think patrick is exactly the kind of senator that florida needs and deserves because he will help us break through gridlock and create more good jobs with rising incomes and patrick knows we have to build an economy from the middle out and the bottom up not from the top down

i also appreciate the fact that we now are seeing an emerging bipartisan consensus that we need to fix our broken criminal justice system do you agree but its going to take strong and committed leaders like patrick murphy who are ready to show up and fight hard and work to get this done and  and this is important my friends unlike his opponent patrick murphy has never been afraid to stand up to donald trump

i think florida deserves a senator whos going to fight for comprehensive immigration reform that will keep families together against a deportation force

this is what is so unimaginable of law enforcement officials to go door to door house to house business to business school to school rounding up  million people i think that is so wrong and it is not going to happen in america so you deserve also a senator who actually believes climate change is real as opposed to someone who every time hes asked says well im not a scientist and i always wonder why dont you talk to a scientist like start here at broward college you could talk to scientists

and you deserve a senator who would never say that social security and medicare have and this is a quote weakened us as a people

his solution patricks opponents solution is to privatize medicare

 boo

 that is exactly the right response but dont boo vote right

and you deserve a senator who would never support cutting  million from floridas schools because patrick knows every child in florida deserves a worldclass education so my friends patrick murphy is a smart toughminded legislator and an independent voice

thats what we need more of in washington people like patrick who are going to get up every day and go to work for you a better life for you and your families instead of blocking progress at every turn listening to the special interests and powerful forces that really are not interested in what its going to take for every one of you to get ahead and stay ahead

so please when you get out and vote please remember you can send patrick murphy to the united states senate and you will be glad you did

now i know theres an overflow crowd outside and im so sorry they cant be in but im told that they can hear us and maybe even see us and i want to thank them for coming as well

i got to ask you did anybody see the last debate

well the good news  the good news was it was the last debate

 happy birthday to you

 well thank you

thank you yeah you know youre right that last debate was like an early birthday present right but heres what i wanted you to remember i stood next to donald trump for four and a half hours proving once again i have the stamina to be president and commander inchief

you know i tried as much as i could to talk about all issues that are on your minds that i believe we can work together to improve and in fact my wonderful running mate i senator tim kaine wrote a book called stronger together and we put all of our policies in it because i want you to know what were going to try to do if were so fortunate enough to be the next president and vice president

and i think its important because i want you to have confidence that were going to work every day to implement the plans that we have put forth and i tried in the debate to draw the contrasts with donald trump who doesnt really have very many plans you know ive tried to run a campaign based on issues hes run a campaign based on insults and so in the debate we didnt have a lot to talk about other than he continued true to form to throw out his insults

but in that last debate he said something that i found horrifying well he said a lot of things cut theres one thing in particular that i wanted to point out because no presidential candidate republican or democrat has ever said this he refused to say that he would respect the outcome the election

i guess we shouldnt be too surprised this is the same guy who said he thought the emmys were rigged against him but this is serious you know on january th the first thing a president does is to take an oath to preserve protect and defend the constitution and i have serious doubts about whether donald trump even understands what that means

in america we dont say were going to keep you in suspense about whether we will respect the outcome of an election we have free and fair elections and the peaceful transfer of power that is one thing that makes american great it makes america who we are

and we dont impose religious tests at our borders because we are a country that was founded on religious liberty and we dont punish newspapers or journalists that try to cover the news or are critical of politicians or threaten to restrict the first amendment because our democracy depends on a free press and we dont incite violence and turn people against each other we respect the open exchange of ideas that a democracy depends on

you know ive got to say i bet some of you or maybe your parents or your grandparents came from places where none of that was true right there is a reason why america is the greatest and longest lasting democracy the world has ever known because we believe that no matter what you look like or where your parents were born or who you love you have the right to be treated equally and fairly in the united states

and donald trump is attacking everything that has set our country apart for  years now after spending his entire campaign attacking one group of americans after another  immigrants african americans latinos women pows muslims people with disabilities  now his final target is democracy itself so heres what i want you to know in the four years we are going to change some things in america right

i do want to get the economy working for everyone not just those at the top and were going to do that along with other positive changes but we are not going to change the fundamental values that made america the greatest nation in the history of the world

you know i think it all started  i think this all started when george washington refused to become a king right now donald trump probably would have called him a loser

instead that was one of the most important decisions any president has ever made eight years its time to move on we fought a revolution so that we would not have a king we would not be subjects we would be independent citizens i cherish that idea

so heres the good news americans are coming together at the very moment when donald trump is making an unprecedented attack on our democracy millions of people are registering voting early and volunteering in this campaign

and heres something very exciting we have reached a milestone more than  million americans are now registered and that includes  million young people the most ever in history

and you know what more than six million people have already voted and more than one million of them are right here in florida

so i think you only see numbers like this when people are standing up for what they really believe in and that includes not just democrats but republicans and independents coming together to reject hate and division and i am so excited about what that means

but the energy we are seeing across florida and america is not just because of what we are against its about what were for it really is its about fighting for that future where everyone counts everyone has a place and no one is left out or behind but i want you to know we still have a lot of work to do i feel good but boy i am not taking anything for granted im going to work as hard as i can between now and the close of the election thats two weeks from today

and you know its so important for florida there are so many issues that we need to remind people about last time i was here i campaigned with al gore and he said a lot about the climate crisis and you know why because were seeing the reality of climate change every day in florida we are seeing areas in miami even on sunny days without a drop of rain where the streets are flooding and the ocean is rising

and what weve got to do is make sure that this issue  fighting climate change creating clean renewable energy jobs  stays at the top of the priorities and thats why you need a new senator like patrick murphy

i have to say nobody should want to wake up on november th and wonder whether there was more you could have done i hope you will wake up on november th proud that you took a stand and voted for an america that belongs to all of us where we set big goals and we work together to achieve them

i got to tell you i believe america is great because america is good

and i want to tell you one other thing i want to say one other thing thats really very important to me we should honor the men and women in uniform who fight for our country

thats why i was so appalled when donald trump tweeted that the new effort underway to push the terrorists out of the key city of mosul is already and i quote him a total disaster and that our country is again a quote looking dumb really hes declaring defeat before the battle has even started hes proving once again he is unqualified to be commander in chief of our military

heres another example he was asked if he would defend our allies he said well first hed want to know if they made any payments to us to defend them and when asked specifically about israel he said and i quote again he would love to be neutral

now we cant have a president who says hes neutral on monday proisrael on tuesday and who knows what on wednesday because in his mind everything is negotiable

i have a different view we stand with our allies we stand with those who will help us defeat terrorism

so i  i get pretty excited about what we could to together and with your help were going to make the biggest investment in new jobs since world war ii  jobs in infrastructure and advanced manufacturing and clean renewable energy and small businesses i want us to make america the clean energy super power of the st century

we can create millions of jobs and protect our planet at the same time and ive got to say no state no state should care more about this issue than florida right and you know ill tell you something that its kind of sad to be honest with you ive traveled all over the country and in new jersey and massachusetts they have more solar power than the sunshine state

why well because you have a governor and a legislature who like your current senator doesnt want to believe the science of climate change doesnt see the opportunity that florida has to be literally the global leader in clean energy

and so i want to deploy a halfbillion more solar panels by the end of my first term and enough clean energy to power every home in america within  years

and were also going to strengthen education at every level starting with universal prek and working  working with our teachers to make sure every child has a good school with good teachers in every zip code and heres what i want all the students to hear were going to make college more affordable for everyone

you know after our primary which was hardfought and i was proud of the primary we ran because it was about issues senator sanders and i got together came up with a plan to make public colleges and universities tuitionfree for any families making less than  a year

thats the vast majority of families and if youre over that were going to make it debtfree so pay what you can afford but i dont want to see young people and their families going into debt i view this as an investment and thats why were going to make it easier for you to afford to pay back your college debt  pay it down and pay it off

and i also want more pathways to good jobs that dont require a fouryear college degree lets return technical education to high schools lets do more with our community colleges lets have more apprenticeship programs so that everybody has a chance at a good job

and you know in addition  in addition to making the economy grow and making sure people are ready with the skills to do these jobs i want to make it fairer thats why i want to raise the national minimum wage if you work fulltime you shouldnt still be in poverty and dont you think it is finally maybe past time to guarantee equal pay for womens work

and you know i always tell crowds this is not a womens issue its a family issue if you have a wife a mother a sister or a daughter working its your issue and thats why we have got to get this fixed once and for all

and lets make childcare affordable and lets have more profit sharing and lets do the kinds of things that will lift everybody up now you know when i talk about raising equal pay for women as one of my primary issues you know donald trump or somebody always says well there she goes playing the woman card and ive got to tell you i dont believe thats what it is i think were paying  playing the smart card

because we want everybodys incomes to go up thats how were going to get this economy really moving forward creating new jobs and so if thats playing the woman card you know what we say deal me in

ive also said i will pledge not to do anything that would raise taxes on people making less than  a year because we dont need to do that we can go where the money is the millionaires and the billionaires the corporations to make them pay their fair share to support the kind of growth that we need in our economy

were going to close the loopholes and make sure no multi millionaire can get away with paying a lower rate than a nurse or a police officer or a teacher

now remember when we learned in one of the debates that donald trump hadnt paid any federal taxes

for about  years is the best guess weve got and his excuse i love his excuse his excuse was well he lost  billion in a year

ive been really pondering this how does anybody lose  billion in a year especially when youre running casinos think about it has anybody here ever been to a casino

 yes

 well you know usually they say the house wins so donald trump said it was smart for him to avoid paying taxes well if losing  billion is smart i think thats kind of upside down and backwards i think people should be working hard to make their incomes to support their families and thats what were going to do because we dont want the kind of values that donald trump used in running his business to be in our government

he stiffs  he stiffs small businesses my dad was a small business owner donald trump has refused to pay all kinds of folks workers small businesses installing drapes or marble or glass or where he bought pianos he didnt pay them he just doesnt pay them and he gets away with it because he turns and he says to these small businesses well go ahead and sue me

well my dad because he was a small business man i know he could never have afforded that so im just glad he never got a contract from donald trump because our family would have been hurt by that

so heres the bottom line and heres what i need you to do we have got to get everybody you know to turn out and vote and you have early voting now and its going to be much easier for some of you to vote early and if you believe in any of the issues that we have talked about in this campaign if you believe that women and girls should be treated with respect if you believe that marriage equality should be protected

if you believe  if believe in science and believe we should take action if you believe america belongs to everybody willing to work for it and we should stand up against any kind of negative tax then i hope you will come out and vote because its going to be a close election pay no attention to the polls dont get  dont get complacent because weve got to turn people out

so im asking you to vote for me im asking you to send patrick murphy to the senate im asking you most importantly to vote for yourselves because really thats what is at stake so early voting began here in south florida yesterday it goes through sunday november th you can go to your early voting site in your county between  am and  pm in fact you can go across the street right now to the north regional library and cast your ballot today

and we have volunteers and staff ready to escort you so hey go ahead and vote now and you can go to iwillvotecom to confirm your polling place and make sure you have a plan to vote but dont stop there if you will join us in these next two weeks every phone call you make every door you knock on will make a difference so please go to hillaryclintoncom sign up to volunteer take out your phone text join to  and get involved because the bigger the turnout the bigger statement we will make about the kind of country we are and the future we want to build together

now let me just end by saying that people ask me all the time you know what motivates you how do you do this day after day and you know look i love this country and i feel blessed i feel blessed and i want everybody to have the same chance to go after your part of the american dream and i think the american dream is big enough for everybody

i think a lot about my two grandchildren because obviously i would do anything to help them but its not just them i want to help everybodys children and grandchildren because the kind of country we will have when they become adults will be affected by the decisions we make now on education on healthcare on ending the epidemic of gun violence on getting the cost of prescription drugs down on preserving and protecting social security and medicare doing what we must to make sure were passing on a country that provides the same level of opportunity to all who come after us

so please join me this is bigger than me its bigger than any of us its even bigger than donald trump if you can believe it

this is a crossroads election thats going to determine so much about what kind of country we have in the decades ahead i want to wake up in the white house with your help making it my mission to do everything i can to give every person and particularly every child the chance to live up to his or her godgiven potential

if you will stand with me if you will work with me over the next two weeks lets go out and build the kind of future we want for ourselves for our kids and lets prove once and for all that love trumps hate

thank you all very much"
129,"Trump","thank you ohio it is so great to be in the great city of canton
we just got new polls from bloomberg and cnn were up five points in ohio and the la times poll has us up  points nationwide

the people of the united states are ready for change theyre ready to discard a failed political establishment that disdains disrespects and looks down on hardworking people

this election is about a choice between the control of an arrogant ruling class in washington dc versus the hopes and dreams of everyday citizens

for years our leaders have looked out only for themselves

there is no greater example of this in our country than flint michigan the city of flint was once known as buick city more than  workers were employed by gm in   today its less than  forty percent of the citys residents are living in poverty violent crime is among the nations highest

today i went to flint michigan to address the water crisis the water crisis in flint demonstrates failure at every single level of government

its tragic and its heartbreaking and it should never happen in the united states of america

this is the catastrophe that happens when we build up other countries instead of our own

it used to be cars were made in flint and you couldnt drink the water in mexico now the cars are made in mexico and you cant drink the water in flint

we are going to turn this around we are going to bring our jobs back and protect our people

driving through the city you see the shuttered homes and businesses the dilapidated infrastructure

this is what our politicians have done to this city this is what our politicians have done to america

but nowhere has the pain been worse than our inner cities democratic politicians have ran our inner cities for    years their policies have produced massive poverty joblessness and failing schools

theyve trapped americans in suffering for years and im running to offer a better future lower crime better schools more jobs  safety security opportunity

now i understand there are going to be some people in these communities who arent planning on voting for me right now i will campaign hard for their votes  we cant stay the course our country is on if you keep voting for the same people youll keep getting the same results

i am willing to campaign anywhere i am willing to go anywhere visit anywhere even if some voters openly oppose me in a community i will go there and ask them for their support

hillary clinton calls people who arent supporting her deplorable and irredeemable i call people who arent supporting me american citizens who are entitled to the same respect as anyone else  and i will not stop campaigning for every last american vote in every last american community right up until november th

i will take my message to communities that are  democrat or that have voted democrat for generations i am running to be president for all americans to represent all americans and to liberate our poorest citizens from crime and poverty and violence

the economic policies of hillary clinton  on trade on the economy on immigration  have devastated the inner cities of america her policies are the problem we are offering the solution

hillary clinton believes in globalism  taking jobs from flint and moving them to other countries i am not running to be president of the world  i am running to be president of the united states i am running to bring hope to flint to canton and to every party of this country

if we dont break free from our partisan boxes then nothing will ever change  its time to vote for america and america first

hillary clintons refugee plans will cost  billion dollars in the longterm thats enough money to rebuild the entire water infrastructure of the united states

president obama just announced a  increase to refugee admissions bringing the total to  refugees in just one single year

instead of providing free healthcare and jobs to millions of refugees we need to rebuild our inner cities and take care of americans

our support comes from every part of america and every walk of life you are cops and soldiers mechanics and accountants young and the old black white and latino you are moms and dads children and grandparents you are from cities small and large and inbetween but above everything else you are all americans

hillary clintons attacks on you display the same sense of arrogance and entitlement that led her to violate federal law as secretary of state hide and delete her emails destroy her phones with a hammer put classified information in the reach of our enemies lie to congress and sell government favors and access through the clinton foundation

now the people who destroyed the emails are all pleading the fifth amendment in front of congress

there is no greater threat to democracy than when a public official puts their office up for sale look at what she did with russian uranium or with ubs bank or with the contracts in haiti

hillary clintons record as secretary of state is one of historic failure just look at what she did to the middle east  in iraq in syria in libya not to mention her failures in russia china and north korea

one failure after another  all while raising millions and millions from her friends in wall street

the policies of hillary clinton have produced only destruction overseas and poverty at home

 in  american households do not have a single member in the labor force another  million people left the labor force entirely since  and the national debt has doubled

i am running to reverse these policies and to create a future of prosperity for all americans

my economic agenda can be summed up in three words jobs jobs jobs

that begins with a new americafirst trade policy

hillary clintons bad judgement was seen in her support for bill clintons nafta her support for chinas entry into the world trade organization and her support for the tpp  she called it the gold standard

ohio has lost nearly  in  manufacturing jobs since nafta and  in  since china entered the wto

our trade deficit in goods with the world is now nearly  billion dollars

i will renegotiate nafta i will defend your jobs and i will bring back vehicle production to the united states of america

americas trade deficit with the proposed tpp member countries cost the state of ohio more than  manufacturing jobs last year imagine how many more jobs would be lost if tpp was actually approved  which hillary clinton  would do if she ever got the chance

we wont let that happen but you have to get out and vote

my first day in office i am also going to order a review of every single regulation issued over the last eight years all needless jobkilling regulations will be cancelled millions of new jobs will come pouring in

we are going to lift the restrictions on american energy

also on my first day i am going to ask congress to send me a bill to immediately repeal and replace disastrous obamacare

i will fight for you against the special interests against the corrupt politicians and against the powerful insiders let me be your champion

in all things its time to put americans first  and start taking care of each other

yesterday i rolled out a plan to help our mothers and our families get affordable quality childcare for their children

on policy after policy we are going to bring opportunity and prosperity to all americans

i am going to lower you taxes i am going to get rid of massive amounts of unnecessary regulations on business and in your life im going to repeal and replace obamacare im going to appoint justices to the supreme court who will follow the constitution im going to rebuild our depleted military and take care of our vets im going to save your nd amendment  im going to stop illegal immigration and drugs coming into our country and yes we will build the wall  and im going to so importantly renegotiate your horrible trade deals especially nafta  which is the single worst trade deal ever made by any country anywhere in the world and a oneway street for jobs out of the united states  and we will make great trade deals that put the american worker first

and apple and our other major companies will start making their iphones computers and other products inside of the united states  not in china and all over the world

we dont make our products anymore in the united states but we will again  like never before

we will rebuild our roads bridges tunnels highways airports schools and hospitals we will rebuild our water infrastructure and our epa will abandon political agendas and focus on its core mission clean air and safe water

american cars will travel the roads american planes will soar in the skies and american ships will patrol the seas

american steel will send new skyscrapers into the clouds

american hands will rebuild this nation  and american energy mined from american sources will power this nation american workers will be hired to do the job

we will put new american steel into the spine of this country

i will fight for every neglected part of this nation  and i will fight to bring us all together as one american people

imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as one people under one god saluting one american flag

it is time to break with the bitter failures of the past and to embrace a new inclusive and prosperous american future

jobs will return incomes will rise and new factories will come rushing back to our shores

once more we will have a government of by and for the people

we will make america wealthy again

we will make america safe again

and will make america great again

thank you and god bless"
130,"Trump","thank you i always look forward to coming back to iowa a state where i have so many friends  including your incredible governor terry branstad
we are doing so well in iowa a recent reuters poll had us up by  points

on november  we are going to win this state and we are going to win the white house

its going to be a victory for you the american people

we are going to take on the special interests the lobbyists and the corrupt corporate media that have rigged the system against everyday americans

we are going to create a new government that serves you your family and your country

lower taxes less regulation more affordable childcare fair trade deals secure borders thriving family farms and millions and millions of new jobs

we are going to end the clinton corruption and restore dignity and honesty to government service

hillary clinton is an insider fighting only for insiders

i am an outsider fighting for you

everything you need to know about hillary clinton can be understood with this simple phrase follow the money

in her campaign for president hillary clinton has received  million dollars in contributions from wall street and the hedge funds

she received  million in speaking fees from financial firms

the same groups paying bill and hillary for their speeches were lobbying the federal government

twentytwo groups paying bill clinton for speeches lobbied the state department while hillary was secretary of state

and dont forget the clinton contributors were appointed to advisory boards by secretary clinton  or all the favors and access granted to those who wrote checks she even gave up  of american uranium to russia

she disgraced the office of secretary of state by putting it up for sale  and if she ever got the chance shed put the oval office up for sale too

we cant let that happen thats why you have to go out and vote on november th and early voting in iowa starts tomorrow

she deleted and bleached  emails after a congressional subpoena  phones missing several destroyed with a hammer her staffers taking the fifth amendment and her ringleaders getting immunity deals foreign enemies with easy access to hack her server lies to congress under oath about turning over her workrelated emails

the clintons have perfected the politics of profit

the large corporations who support terrible trade deals that offshore jobs  they are donating to hillary clinton

the wall street investors who have rigged the regulations against the middle class  they are donating to hillary clinton

the wealthy donors who want to shut down american energy  they are donating to hillary clinton

the special interests who want open borders are donating to hillary clinton thats why hillary clinton is pushing for a  increase in syrian refugees

she and her financial backers will say anything do anything lie about anything to keep their grip on power  to keep their control over this country

the american people have had it with corrupt clinton ways they are tired of the lies they are tired of the trivial politics they are tired of being talked down to looked down upon and treated like second class citizens

how many more clinton scandals can this country take  one after another after another they are the sordid past we are the bright future

while our campaign outlines big changes and bold solutions to make your life better the clinton campaign focuses only on small and petty distractions

never in american history have so many serious challenges been met with so unserious a campaign as the campaign of hillary clinton

this will be the year the american people say enough is enough

its time for real change  a new foreign policy a new economic policy a new immigration policy a new trade policy

hillary clinton has been a disaster for so many communities but especially for africanamerican communities i dont think africanamericans are going to come out and vote for clinton  they are too smart and they know they are being used they also know that shell do nothing for them once the election is over  she never does and that will never change many of them will never forget her calling young africanamerican men superpredators

same thing goes for hispanic voters  they are tired of being used by people like hillary clinton that have no intention of doing anything for them once the election is over

hillary clinton is a vessel for the special interests trying to strip this country of its wealth its jobs and its status as a sovereign nation she is a globalist who has made a career taking jobs from our country and giving them to other countries

i am not running to be president of the world i am running to be president of the united states of america

from now on its going to be america first

have you ever wondered why it is that all things that the american people want never seem to happen

why cant we have the schools we want and the borders we want and the security we want why cant we have policies that support small business or family farms or the miners and the steelworkers

the answer is simple because the financial interests who control our politics and our media dont want these changes to happen

these special interests control hillary clinton she is their chosen representative you can disregard everything she says and just remember this phrase follow the money shes there for only one reason to protect her donors

look at her career shes been there for  years and has never done anything for you and your family shes failed at everything she failed in iraq in libya in syria in iran in egypt she failed on russia on china on north korea

she failed upstate new york

she failed the inner cities

shes failed women and children ive created thousands of jobs for women in this country of incredible talent hillary clinton has been in washington for  years and now  million american women and children are in poverty or on the brink of poverty

and she has been a disaster on our borders

id like to invite on up here michelle root the mother of sarah root who was killed by an illegal immigrant released into the country under the obama catchandrelease policies championed by hillary clinton

hillary clinton supports sanctuary cities where was the sanctuary for sarah

the only people hillary clinton has ever delivered for are her donors just follow the money

her single greatest achievement may be getting away with her massive email scandal and criminal coverup

our campaign is taking on big business big media and big donors  were taking them on for you so you can have the future you want

that includes keeping your family safe

new fbi statistics shows that homicide rose  last year in americas large cities and that its the largest singleyear increase in  years

more than  people have been shot in chicago since january

 of murder victims under the age of  in this country are africanamerican

 of africanamerican children under the age of  are living in poverty

i will never back down from fighting to save american lives

i will never back down from fighting to create safety and wealth for our inner cities

my economic agenda can be summed up in three very beautiful words jobs jobs jobs

we will cut your taxes reduce regulations  including on our farmers  negotiate great trade deals unleash american energy and we are going to repeal and replace obamacare

we are also going to end common core and offer school choice to every disadvantaged child  including every poor hispanic and africanamerican child in america

the people getting rich off the rigged system are the people throwing their money at hillary clinton remember follow the money

our campaign is about breakingup the special interest monopoly in washington dc were trying to disrupt the collusion between the wealthy donors the large corporations and the media executives

theyre all part of the same political establishment they go to the same restaurants they attend the same conferences they have the same friends and connections and they nod along when hillary clinton slanders you as deplorable and irredeemable

i call you hardworking american patriots and together we are going to save this country

government will start working again fixing things is what i do just look at my projects in new york and around the world where i revitalized neighborhoods and lifted up skylines

an article in the new york post was published recently called how donald trump helped save new york city

the article said quote trump waded into a landscape of empty fifth avenue storefronts the dustbowl mugging ground that was central park and a wall street area seemingly on its last legs as companies moved out almost by force of will  rode to the rescue expressing rare faith in the future he was instrumental in kickstarting the regeneration of neighborhoods and landmarks almost given up for dead

thats what i want to do for our country  i want to go into the neglected neighborhoods the failing schools the forgotten stretches of this nation and unlock their potential for all of our people

together we can accomplish anything we want

but that means you need to show up and vote on november th  and it means you need to start voting early early voting is so important

you have to knock on doors you have to pick up that phone you have to campaign on the streets spread the love that we have in this room to the people of our country to beat the system you have to lift your voice pound the pavement and get out the vote visit our website to find out how you can help

you have six weeks until the election you have six weeks to make every dream you ever dreamed for your country come true

you have one magnificent chance to deliver justice for every forgotten man woman and child in this nation

the arrogance of washington dc will soon come face to face with the righteous verdict of the american voter

this november th we are going to show the whole world that america is back  bigger and better and stronger than ever before

here is just some of what will happen starting in january of 

i am going to lower your taxes eliminate every unnecessary regulation repeal and replace obamacare unleash american energy end illegal immigration keep radical islamic terrorists out of our country save the nd amendment support the men and women of law enforcement and appoint justices to the supreme court who will uphold and defend the constitution of the united states

we will rebuild our roads bridges tunnels highways airports schools and hospitals

american cars will travel the roads american planes will soar in the skies and american ships will patrol the seas

american steel will send new skyscrapers into the clouds

american hands will rebuild this nation  and american energy harvested from american sources will power this nation american workers will be hired to do the job

we will put new american steel into the spine of this country

i will fight for every neglected part of this nation  and i will fight to bring us all together as americans

imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as one people under one god saluting one american flag

it is time to break with the bitter failures of the past and to embrace a new inclusive and prosperous american future

once more we will have a government of by and for the people

we will make america wealthy again

we will make america strong again

we will make america safe again

and we will make america great again

thank you and god bless"
131,"Trump","thank you thats so nice thank you
well thats so nice and bishop jackson i want to thank you and dr jackson and you have some voice i have to say incredible and some spirit some spirit talent

thank you well i just wrote this the other day knowing id be here and i mean it from the heart and id like to just read it and i think youll understand it maybe better than i do in certain ways

for centuries the africanamerican church has been the conscience of our country so true its from the pews and pulpits and christian teachings of black churches all across this land that the civil rights movement lifted up its soul and lifted up the soul of our nation its from these pews that our nation has been inspired toward a better moral character a deeper concern for mankind and spirit of charity and unity that binds us all together and were bound together and i see that today this has been an amazing day for me

the africanamerican faith community has been one of gods greatest gifts to america and to its people there is perhaps no action our leaders can take that would do more to heal our country and support our people than to provide a greater platform to the black churches and churchgoers you do right everyday by your community and your families you raise children in the light of god i will always support your church always and defend your right to worship    so important

i am here today to listen to your message and i hope that my presence here will also help your voice to reach new audiences in our country and many of these audiences desperately need your spirit and your thought i can tell you that

christian faith is not the past but the present and the future make it stronger and well open it up to great great leaders like pastor jackson bishop jackson dr jackson and so many others and so many others actually sitting here darrell scott who is phenomenal who has been with me for so long so long omrosea who is a very nice person and i dont want to say that because ill destroy her image by saying that shes actually a very very fine person and pastor and i want to thank all the folks and there is somebody thats been very special to me dr ben carson whos been    stand up ben come here come here come here ben this is a great man and great guy

so as i prepare to campaign all across the nation and in every community i will have an opportunity to lay out my plans for economic change which will be so good for detroit and so good for this community because were going to bring jobs back i will have a chance    thank you were bringing them back were taking them from mexico and everywhere else because theyre gone

i will have a chance to discuss school choice its very important and how to put every american on the ladder of success a great education a great job but today i just want to let you know that i am here to listen to you and i have been doing that and we had a fantastic interview with bishop jackson it was really an amazing interview he is better than the people who do that professionally i will tell you its true its true its true hes better

and i didnt really know what i was getting into i didnt know is this going to be nice is this going to be wild hes a great gentleman and a very smart guy i just hope you dont lose him to hollywood thats the only problem and especially and especially dr jackson she may be gone hollywood is calling look at all those television cameras back there look at all the television cameras im sorry to do that to you bishop because its just one of those things right

our nation is too divided we talk past each other not to each other and those who seek office do not do enough to step into the community and learn what is going on they dont know they have no clue im here today to learn so that we can together remedy injustice in any form and so that we can also remedy economics so that the africanamerican community can benefit economically through jobs and income and so many other different ways

our political system has failed the people and works only to enrich itself i want to reform that system so that it works for you everyone in this room i believe true reform can only come from outside the system i really mean that being a businessman is much different than being a politician because i understand what is happening and we are going outside the establishment

becoming the nominee of the party of abraham lincoln  a lot of people dont realize that abraham lincoln the great abraham lincoln was a republican  has been the greatest honor of my life it is on his legacy that i hope to build the future of the party but more important the future of the country and the community

i believe that we need a civil rights agenda for our time one that ensures the rights to a great education  so important  and the right to live in safety and in peace and to have a really really great job a good paying job and one that you love going to every morning that can happen we need to bring our companies back

it also means the right to have a government that protects our works and fights really fights for our jobs i want to help you build and rebuild detroit and we can do that especially with people like bishop jackson and dr jackson i mean that its been an amazing experience its been an amazing experience really

nothing is more sad than when we sideline young black men with unfulfilled potential tremendous potential i met some people this morning that are incredible people and theyre looking for jobs these are incredible people    young people our whole country loses out when were unable to harness the brilliance and the energy of these folks

were one nation and when anyone hurts we all hurt together that is so true so true

were all brothers and sisters and were all created by the same god we must love each other and support each other and we are in this all together all together

i fully understand that the africanamerican community has suffered from discrimination and that there are many wrongs that must still be made right and they will be right i want america prosperous for everyone i want to make this city the economic envy of the world and we can do that we can do that again

factories everywhere new roads and bridges new schools  especially schools  and new hope

i have been so greatly blessed and in so many ways with no greater blessing than my family ive had a great family

nothing would make me happier and more fulfilled than to use what i have learned in business and in traveling all over the world  ive sort of seen a lot  to bring the wealth and prosperity and opportunity to those who have not had these opportunities before and thats many many people in detroit

id like to conclude with a passage from  john chapter  you know it see most groups i speak to dont know that but we know it if you want we can say it together no one has ever seen god but if we love one another god lives in us and his love is made complete in us and that is so true

thank you very much this has been such an honor thank you very much bishop thank you sir thank you thank you thank you"
132,"Trump","thank you its wonderful to be back in north carolina
come november  we are going to win this state and we are going to win the white house

we are going to bring back your jobs

we are going to cut your taxes

we are going to renegotiate our disastrous trade deals

and we are going to protect our country from radical islamic terrorism

over the weekend there were islamic terrorist attacks in minnesota and new york city and in new jersey these attacks were made possible because of our extremely open immigration system which fails to properly vet and screen the individuals or families coming into our country

attack after attack  from  to san bernardino to orlando  we have seen how failures to screen who is entering the united states puts all of our citizens in danger

so let me state this very clearly immigration security is national security

my opponent has the most open borders policy of anyone ever to seek the presidency as secretary of state she allowed thousands of criminal aliens to be released into our communities because their home countries wouldnt take them back

now obama wants to bring in an additional  refugees and hillary wants a  increase in syrian refugees altogether hillary clintons plan would bring in  refugees in her first term  with no effective way to screen or vet them her plan would cost  billion dollars in terms of lifetime welfare and entitlement costs

this isnt just a matter of terrorism but also quality of life we want to make sure we are only admitting people into our country who love our country

my highest duty as president is to protect our citizens and to uphold the constitution of the united states i will honor that duty to the fullest extent every single day  and i will never waver in that sacred obligation

its just a plain fact that our current immigration system makes no real attempt to determine the views of the people entering since  hundreds of immigrants and their children have been implicated in terrorism and terroristrelated activity in the united states

now we learn that another  immigrants from dangerous countries have slipped into our country and been granted citizenship despite pending deportation orders this is unacceptable

altogether there are nearly  million individuals in the united states with deportation orders who have not yet been removed

in the th century the united states defeated fascism nazism and communism

now we must defeat radical islamic terrorism

yet my opponent wont even say the words radical islamic terrorism in fact hillary clinton talks tougher about my supporters than she does about islamic terrorists she calls the patriotic americans who support our campaign  many of them cops and soldiers  deplorable and irredeemable has she ever talked that way about radical islam or about those who oppress and murder women and gays overseas has hillary clinton ever called people who support these practices deplorable and irredeemable in many countries overseas nonbelievers face the death penalty  where is hillarys condemnation here

lets ask hillary clinton how many people who subscribe to radical islamic views and support the oppression of nonbelievers would you call deplorable or irredeemable  or are those words reserved only for hardworking americans that truly love their country and that support donald trump

america can never elect a president like hillary clinton who apparently with her choice of words thinks decent american citizens are a bigger threat than radical islamic terrorists

anyone who cannot name our enemy is not fit to lead this country anyone who cannot condemn the hatred oppression and violence of radical islam lacks the moral clarity to serve as our president

the commanderinchief of this nation must speak with moral clarity and conviction our system of government is the best in the world and as your president i will defend our values  and speak out against all those who assault our values in any way

its also time to remember one very important word accountability all this disaster with isis happened on hillary clintons watch

her policies in iraq libya and syria are responsible for the rise of isis her attacks on me are all meant to deflect from her record of unleashing this monstrous evil upon us

her timetable withdrawal from iraq her push for regime change in libya and syria her open borders policies  these are the actions that unleashed the isis disaster

so she will say and do anything to distract from that record of total failure

her claim that my opposition to radical islamic terrorism is a recruiting tool demonstrates a level of ignorance about the terror threat that is disqualifying

when she says my opposition to radical islamic terror provides aid and comfort to the enemy we know that hillary clinton has once again demonstrated that she is dangerously unfit for office her comments are not only reckless but beneath the dignity of the office she seeks

isis is torturing murdering executing and exterminating people in a campaign of genocide and what is hillary clintons suggestion that we should censor our vocabulary so as not to upset these butchers i have news for hillary clinton refusing to call out radical islam will not lessen the danger it will only increase and embolden the danger  just like we have seen during her disastrous and failed tenure as secretary of state

the rise of isis is hillary clintons foreign policy legacy

secretary clinton has helped to topple regimes displace millions and then opened the door to isis to enter our country how is this a smart policy

hillary clintons decisions overseas have left us with the threat we face today  and her immigration policies will invite this threat onto our shores

we must stop the massive inflow of refugees  which hillary clinton is trying to drastically increase we should temporarily suspend immigration entirely from regions where safe and adequate screening cannot occur

pew polling shows that in many of the countries from which we draw large numbers of immigrants extreme views about religion  such as the death penalty for those who leave the faith are commonplace

it is the job of a responsible government to admit only those who we expect to succeed and flourish here and to become part of our incredible home hillary clinton disagrees with this common sense rule and its one more reason why she can never be president

its time to break with the corruption the bad judgement and the failures of the past

it is time to have a new american future

we are going to change our immigration system to reflect american values

we are going to stop the policy of regime change overseas and instead focus on working with our allies on a military campaign to utterly destroy isis and defeat islamic terrorism this will not only require military warfare but also financial warfare cyber warfare and ideological warfare

but to win this struggle we need to be strong at home

we are going to rebuild our country

and at the center of that effort will be the rebuilding of our inner cities

nearly  in  africanamerican children live in poverty including  of africanamerican children under the age of six  of africanamerican youth are not working

violent crime rose in americas fifty largest cities last year homicides are up nearly  in washington dc and more than  in baltimore

more than  people have been shot in chicago since january of this year

the schools are failing the jobs are leaving and millions are trapped in poverty

to the africanamerican community i say vote for donald j trump i will fix it  i will bring back your jobs i will fix your schools and i will fight for you as no one ever has before

it is time for a new civil rights agenda one that promises safe communities great education and goodpaying jobs

my whole life has been about creating jobs hillary clinton has spent her career destroying jobs  just look at upstate new york and her terrible trade deals

hillary clinton supported nafta she supported chinas entrance into the world trade organization and she supported the jobkilling deal with south korea that she helped to push through

the south korean deal was supposed to create  jobs  instead we lost  jobs and our trade deficit with south korea has more than doubled

next hillary clinton wants the transpacific partnership

your state has lost more than  in  manufacturing jobs since nafta i am going to renegotiate this disastrous deal  and if we dont get the deal we want i will walk away

our trade deficit is now nearly  billion a year  this is the economic legacy of hillary clinton

but we are going to turn it all around

my economic agenda can be summed up in three very beautiful words jobs jobs jobs

i am going to lower your taxes i am going to get rid of massive amounts of unnecessary regulations on business and in your life im going to repeal and replace obamacare im going to create american energy independence im going to make our government lean responsible and efficient im going to fix our terrible trade deals and defend american workers im going to rebuild our depleted military and take care of our vets and im going to appoint justices to the supreme court who will follow the constitution of the united states

we will rebuild our roads bridges tunnels highways airports schools and hospitals

american cars will travel the roads american planes will soar in the skies and american ships will patrol the seas

american steel will send new skyscrapers into the clouds

american hands will rebuild this nation  and american energy harvested from american sources will power this nation american workers will be hired to do the job

we will put new american steel into the spine of this country

i will fight for every neglected part of this nation  and i will fight to bring us all together as one american people

imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as one people under one god saluting one american flag

it is time to break with the bitter failures of the past and to embrace a new inclusive and prosperous american future

jobs will return incomes will rise and new factories will come rushing onto our shores

once more we will have a government of by and for the people

we will make america wealthy again

we will make america strong again

we will make america safe again

and we will make america great again

thank you and god bless"
133,"Clinton","hank you thank you all hello everyone its great to be here at unc greensboro i want to thank martha for that wonderful introduction it means so much to have her here along with her wonderful daughter sara and her mother barbara and the story she told is really one that motivates me every day because it is kids like sara that led me to politics in the first place to try to make our country and our world better for them so to see sara grown up and thriving is very special and your whole familys support really means the world to me thank you martha sara barbara
i have to say its great to be back on the campaign trail as you may know i recently had a cough that turned out to be pneumonia i tried to power through it but even i had to admit that maybe a few days of rest would do me good and im not great at taking it easy even under ordinary circumstances but with just two months to go until election day sitting at home was pretty much the last place i wanted to be

but it turns out having a few days to myself was actually a gift i talked with some old friends i spent time with our very sweet dogs i did some thinking the campaign trail doesnt really encourage reflection and its important to sit with your thoughts every now and then and that did help me reconnect with what this whole campaign is about

people like me  were lucky when im under the weather  now i just want to have a conversation and other people can wave their arms and their signs but i want you to think with me for a minute about how i certainly feel lucky when im under the weather i can afford to take a few days off millions of americans cant they either go to work sick or they lose a paycheck dont they

lots of americans still dont even have insurance or they do but its too expensive for them to actually use so they toss back some tylenols they chug orange juice and they hope that the cough or the virus goes away on its own

lots of working parents cant afford childcare which in many states costs as much as college tuition so for millions of moms and dads if they get sick theres no backup theyre on their own arent they

thats the story for too many people still in america when illness strikes or an accident happens you feel youre on your own if you lose your job or cant afford college youre on your own if your aging parent starts needing more help and you dont know what to do youre on your own

life events like these are catastrophic for some families but mere bumps in the road for others i have met so many people living on a razors edge one illness away from losing their job one paycheck away from losing their home and that goes against everything we stand for as americans because some things should not come down to luck some things should be within reach for everyone no matter what like financial security like affordable health care like the peace of mind that comes with knowing that if something goes wrong your family will be okay and above all the knowledge that no matter what your president is fighting for you and will always have your back

that right there thats why i got into this race i am running for everyone working hard to support their families everyone whos been knocked down but gets back up the factory workers on their feet all day and the nurses looking after patients all night im running for young people like so many of you here who dream of changing our world for the better and for all the parents and grandparents supporting those dreams by dedicating every dollar they can spare to your education

im running for the lgbt teenager here in north carolina who sees your governor sign a bill legalizing discrimination and suddenly feels like a secondclass citizen and if anyone wonders what the costs of discrimination are just ask the people and businesses of north carolina look at whats happening with the ncaa and the acc this is where bigotry leads and we cant afford it  not here not anywhere else in america

im running for women like janelle turner back in may of last year janelle was diagnosed with breast cancer she went through nearly six months of very tough treatments last october she brought her eightyearold daughter to one of our rallies in iowa and they made a huge sign that read thirteenth chemo yesterday three more hear me roar wouldnt you want to meet the woman behind that sign well i sure did so we got talking and weve stayed in touch she keeps promising me shell see me at the inauguration and i tell her ill keep working to get there but shed better be there too

im running for her and all the mothers and fathers trying to get and stay healthy so they can be there for their kids but perhaps most of all im running for those kids standing up for children has been the work of my life as a lawyer with the childrens defense fund as first lady in arkansas in the white house as a senator i have fought for kids housed in adult jails kids who have been neglected and abused kids who couldnt get health insurance because of preexisting conditions kids with disabilities so they could go to school you heard today from someone ive known for a long time now grown up and a lovely young woman anastasia somoza i learned from my family and my methodist faith that we are each called to do all the good we can for all the people we can for however long we can and to me that means making sure all our children have the chance to live up to their godgiven potentials

so when i meet a little girl in nevada terrified that her parents are going to be deported it hits me right in the gut when i meet a little boy in flint michigan who cant drink the water at home or in school because its poisoned with lead that gets me going all i want to do is get to work making things better for them

thats why i care so much about national security too i want to give our kids a safer world to me that means a world with strong allies more friends fewer enemies and fewer nuclear weapons it also means leading the fight against climate change so we can leave our kids a health planet

my opponent in this race disagrees with me on every one of these fronts just a few days ago he said that if another countrys troops taunted ours  not fired at them but taunted them just taunts  hed responded  he would respond by blowing them out of the water he would start a war over that that is just one more reason my friends why the stakes in this election are as high as any in our lifetimes

ive been involved in politics in one way or another for many years it is not an easy business it can get rough and ive built up some defenses when it comes to public service im better at the service part than the public part but this is why i do it and this is who im in it for to make life better for children and families and thats what this race has always been about for me

well now were in the final stretch there are just  days till election day just  days till the most consequential vote of our lifetimes and just a little more than a month until early voting starts here in north carolina lets make these days count particularly here because you know what your governor and legislature tried to do  make it harder for young people to vote harder for people of color harder for people with disabilities harder for the elderly there cant be any more motivation than that to make sure every young person every person of color every person with a disability every older person turns out and votes

so in these final days lets try to tune out all the chatter and the nonstop analysis that doesnt often have much to do with what the next president has to do to create good jobs to create opportunity to make it possible for every young person to afford to go to college or get the skills that you need for the jobs of the future lets talk about what really matters

and heres my promise to you im going to close my campaign the way i began my career and the way i will serve as your president should you give me that great honor  focused on opportunities for kids and fairness for families

next week ill go to philadelphia to talk about challenges facing our young people in florida to focus on building an economy that welcomes everyones contributions including people with disabilities then ill be back here in north carolina to meet with more working families from now until november th everywhere i go im going to talk about my ideas for our country my campaign has rolled out detailed plans in  different policy areas  yes somebody actually counted everything from reining in wall street to creating goodpaying jobs to fighting alzheimers to supporting people with autism you see i have this oldfashioned notion that if youre running for president you should say what you plan to do how youre going to get it done and how youre going to pay for it you can read it all on my website hillaryclintoncom we even put it in a new book called you guessed it stronger together get a copy of it because it tells you everything tim kaine and i intend to do

now like a lot of women i have a tendency to overprepare i sweat the details whether were talking about the exact level of lead in the water in flint or how many north carolina kids are in early enrichment programs or the precise interest rate on your student loans right down to the decimal because you know what its not a detail if its your kid its not a detail if its your family its a big deal and it should be a big deal to your president

now i confess ill never be the showman my opponent is and thats okay with me just look at  look at the show he put on with dr oz today but i am going to deliver for you and your family just like i did for sarah all those years ago with the childrens health insurance program that gave her the chance to be the extraordinary young woman she is and ill tell you something else people accuse me of all kinds of things you probably have seen that but nobody ever accuses me of quitting and i will never give up ill never walk away no matter how tough the going gets im actually asking americans to hold me accountable for my ideas and hold my opponent accountable for his

we dont need a president who says the minimum wage is too high we need a president who knows that americans deserve a raise to get to a living wage we dont need a president who wants to take away peoples health coverage we need a president who wants everyone to have quality affordable health care and we dont need a president who apparently thinks only married people deserve paid leave and only mothers stay home with kids we dont need someone who rushes out a halfbaked plan just weeks before an election after decades of ignoring or putting down working moms we need a president who has spent years fighting for these issues who has a plan to support all families in all their various shapes ask yourself which candidate you can count on to be on your side respect your family stand up and fight for you and your kids

that is who you should vote for on november th because as michelle obama said in her fabulous speech at the democratic convention when we go to the polls this november the real choice isnt between democrat or republican its about who will have the power to shape our children for the next four years of their lives its also about the kind of country we want to be and what we want to leave behind for future generations people have to decide are we going to make our economy work for everyone or just those at the top are we going to bring people together or pit americans against each other and rip our country apart are we going to work with our allies to keep us safe or are we going to put a loose cannon in charge who would risk everything generations of americans have worked so hard to build

now i have a lot of confidence in the american people and in our country my opponent keeps running us down saying were weak a disaster an embarrassment every time he says things like that i think about janelle and her strength in the face of cancer or martha and sarah in the face of their health challenges and that little boy in flint who gets up every day and goes to school even though he cant drink the water see my opponent has america all wrong theres nothing we cant do when we come together as one nation set big goals and pursue them

and the american dream  the american dream is big enough for everyone to share in its promise so if you believe the minimum wage should be a living wage that no one who works fulltime should have to raise their child in poverty join us if you believe that every man woman and child in america has the right to affordable health care and women should be free to make our own health decisions join us if you believe  if you believe your working mother wife sister or daughter deserves equal pay then join us get involved these last  days go to hillaryclintoncom or text join join to  we need volunteers right here in north carolina we cant do this without you

and remember the presidential race isnt the only one this fall weve got a lot of important statewide races lets come together and send deborah ross to represent the people in the senate starting on october th you can register and vote early at the same time at any onestop early voting site in your county so the heat is on spread the word tell your friends your family your neighbors if you share our vision for americas future come be part of helping us shape it we do not have a minute to lose

we have so many blessings now its our job to deliver on those and to make sure every single person and particularly every child no matter who they are what they look like or who they love is part of the american dream now and way into the future let that be our message let that be our mission please come out and help us fight fight for you fight for our children fight for our families lets make america all that it should be thank you and god bless you"
134,"Trump","hello kent state and happy halloween everybody its great to be back in ohio  even if even if the world series is making life very stressful for cubs fans everywhere
i want to thank bruce blair for that introduction and for his service to our nation i think every american should hear your story over the next  days before they vote i also want to thank everyone who was part of the preprogram in particular let me thank senator sherrod brown such a great senator my dear friend and great congressman tim ryan state representative john boccieri state representative kathleen clyde and let me thank the kent clarks the acapella group that sang during the preprogram

my friends we are about to enter the final week of this election so i wanted to come back to ohio one of the most competitive and consequential battlegrounds in the country to talk about whats at stake in this election but let me start with this im sure a lot of you may be asking what this new email story is about and why in the world the fbi would decide to jump into an election with no evidence of any wrongdoing with just days to go thats a good question

and first of all for those of you who are concerned about my using personal email i understand and as ive said im not making excuses i said it was a mistake and i regret it and now they apparently want to look at emails of one of my staffers and by all means they should look at them and i am sure they will reach the same conclusion they did when they looked at my emails for the last year there is no case here and they said it wasnt even a close call and i think most people have decided a long time ago what they think about all of this

now what people are focused on is choosing the next president and commanderinchief of the united states of america and did any of you see the debates well i think it was important because i had a chance to talk about my  years of public service and my plans for our country and then people could weigh that against what my opponent has done and said i am running against a man who says he doesnt understand why we cant use nuclear weapons he actually said then why are we making them and he wants more countries to have nuclear weapons japan south korea even saudi arabia imagine nuclear weapons smack in the middle of the middle east

and if youre telling yourself hell surround himself with smart people wholl stop these crazy ideas remember this when he asked who he consults on foreign policy donald trump said he didnt need to consult because he said and i quote i have a very good brain he said he knows more about isis than our generals do no he does not and of course the people donald trump has had around him include two men whose activities are reportedly being investigated for their ties to russia  vladimir putin and putins allies

so in these last days lets not get distracted from the real choice in this election and the consequences for your future i started saying last june i believe that donald trump has proven himself temperamentally unfit and totally unqualified to be president and commanderinchief and ive got to tell you i did not take any pleasure in saying that i have known i have known for years now people who ran for president republicans and democrats and i had my differences with republicans and even with democrats but i never doubted their fitness to serve donald trump is different thats as serious as it gets

so today i want to talk about our national security because when the election is over and people wake up on november th we will have picked the person who will carry the responsibility for all these weighty decisions and that should really convince anyone how high the stakes really are in this election and i just want to focus on three of the most crucial questions facing the next president can you be trusted to command our nuclear arsenal and make literally life and death decisions about war and peace how do you handle a crisis and do you know the difference between our allies and our adversaries

well start with nuclear weapons now i know there are some who will say that any discussion of this topic could be fearmongering but i dont think so and in part of what you just heard from bruce blair when dozens of retired nuclear launch officers publicly state that donald trump should and i quote not have his finger on the button then this is a topic that cant be avoided and as ive said donald has repeatedly suggested that more countries should have nuclear weapons he must not realize or care that the more nuclear material there is in the world the more likely terrorists are to get their hands on it  or that someone will miscalculate and start a war that cant be stopped and when a few more countries go nuclear their neighbors will feel pressure to do so as well

one of the reasons i worked so hard to impose sanctions on iran so that we could get them to the negotiating table was so we would not have a nuclear arms race in the middle east and i am proud that we put a lid on irans nuclear weapons program but even the prospect of an actual nuclear war doesnt seem to bother donald trump good luck enjoy yourselves folks was what he had to say about a potential nuclear conflict in asia

i wonder if he knows that a single nuclear warhead can kill millions of people these are weapons today far more powerful than the bombs that destroyed hiroshima and nagasaki during world war ii

to talk so casually so cavalierly about mass annihilation is truly appalling president ronald reagan once said  and he worked hard for arms control and i admired what he did working with the soviet union  and he once said he feared and this is a quote from president reagan some fool or some maniac or some accident triggering the kind of war that is the end of the line for all of us that has been the fear and the commitment of democratic and republican presidents since the dawn of the atomic age

so what would he think about donald trump who says he wants to be and i quote unpredictable about using the most powerful weapons ever produced and heres the thing with nuclear weapons  as bruce told you when the president gives the order thats it theres no veto for congress no veto by the joint chiefs the officers in the silos have no choice but to fire and that can take as little as four minutes thats why all those retired launch officers stepped forward and said donald trump should never be put in charge of our nuclear arsenal

earlier you heard from one of them bruce blair and his story is worth remembering in  bruce was a young military officer working in an underground bunker in montana his job was to launch as many as  nuclear weapons if the president ever gave the order then one night in october as the united states and the soviet union squared off over an escalating conflict in the middle east the emergency message he had trained for arrived prepare for nuclear war like other american officers in bunkers and submarines and bombers around the world bruce and his colleagues started the process because that was their duty they unlocked the safe took out the launch codes and the keys and then strapped into their chairs to brace for the shockwaves that would come if a russian warhead detonated above them then they waited for the final order from the president thankfully it never came but when bruce looks at donald trump and sees his hairtrigger temper and he thinks about what it felt like inside that bunker that night as ive said many times a man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons

and that brings me to the second question i think voters should pose to both candidates how do you handle a crisis weve seen in this campaign that donald trump loses his cool at the slightest provocation when hes gotten a tough question from a reporter when hes challenged in a debate when he sees a protestor at a rally when hes confronted with his own words so imagine him in the oval office facing a real crisis imagine his advisors afraid to tell him what he doesnt want to hear racing against his legendarily short attention span to lay out lifeanddeath choices too complex to be reduced to a single tweet and then imagine him plunging us into a war because somebody got under his very thin skin

now thankfully hes never been in a position where he had to help make lifeanddeath decisions for our country but there was one national crisis where we did get a good look at how donald trump handles himself donald is a new yorker and his finest moment in this campaign was when he defended new york against ted cruzs attacks in a debate and then he invoked the days after  when new yorkers really came together and took care of each other and i couldnt agree more thats why it was so upsetting to learn what donald was actually doing on  after the world watched with horror as the twin towers fell he called in to a new york tv station and even on that horrible day when thousands of people lost their lives he couldnt stop himself from pointing out that now because the towers had fallen a building he owned was now the tallest in lower manhattan what kind of a person brags at a moment like that ill tell you someone who should never set foot in the oval office and serve as commander in chief

for me i take this very personally my friends because i was one of new yorks senators along with chuck schumer on  he and i were on the ground the very next day meeting with the governor the mayor emergency officials and i will never forget the sight of ground zero the thick smoke made it hard to breathe or see some of the firefighters and other first responders we met had been on duty nonstop since the planes hit the towers they had all lost friends in a makeshift command center we were briefed on the damage and it was clear we were going to need a lot of help to recover new york and we were going to have to really make it our absolute mission to not only rebuild new york but to keep america safe

thats what i did for eight years as a senator i never stopped fighting to keep our country safer and to ensure that first responders got the medical care they needed and i think its important to reflect on what each of us has done in moments like that because a lot of the crises that come at a president are not predicted they happen ill tell you a quick story it was after presidentelect obama asked me to be secretary of state but before the inauguration and i got a call to come to an emergency meeting in the white house in the situation room and the new obama national security team was on one side of table and the outgoing bush national security team was on the other side and the bush administration had gotten credible intelligence that there was going to be an attack at our inauguration

so even before we were sworn in to do our jobs we were faced with helping to make such a consequential decision it really matters what your experience has what your values are whether you can be counted on to make that decision you learn a lot about people in moments like that and as i sat there with the pressure on having to think through in my own head how we evaluated this intelligence how we did everything we could to preserve our inauguration of our first african american president on the mall in washington

we made the decision to go forward obviously some of you might have been there but we also did everything we could to double our efforts to find out about the intelligence and to secure the hundreds of thousands of people who would be there so you have to ask yourself in a crisis who would you trust who will listen to good advice keep a level head and make the right call because thats the person you want as our president and commander in chief

now lets get to the third question for all of the voters to consider about each of us do you know the difference between our allies and our adversaries now this may seem like an easy question if you got it on an exam i think youd be able to answer it but apparently its hard for donald he has picked fights with our friends i mean the president of mexico the british prime minister the german chancellor pretty much the entire nation of japan and he even picked a fight with the pope and at the same time he is praising tyrants and dictators like saddam hussein and kim jong un in north korea and bashar alassad for their supposed strong leadership he even praised the chinese government for massacring protesters in tiananmen square trump has repeatedly suggested he would abandon our allies in europe and asia

he has called nato quote obsolete obsolete nato is the greatest military alliance in the history of the world and its based on something called article v which says an attack on one is an attack on all and article v has only been invoked one time when our allies came to our defense after  we still have nato allies fighting side by side working side by side with american troops in afghanistan they joined us in going after al qaeda and bin laden now were supposed to tell them we wont have their back

and by the wayright now our nato allies are helping identify and track terrorists who threaten america and europe theyre hosting radar and missile defense installations that protect us against potential threats from iran and elsewhere and as our nato forces in afghanistan stand shouldertoshoulder with american troops they share the risks and burdens now theyre moving into the baltic states to deter russian aggression

treating our allies like the small businesses and contractors that trump exploited and stiffed in atlantic city  hanging them out to dry  would make our country and our world less safe and it would play right into the hands of russia and china which are envious of our alliances and eager to see them weaken or fail but maybe thats the point because whats most striking about all of this  and i would argue most important for voters to consider  is the relationship between donald trump and russian president vladimir putin

as former secretary madeleine albright put it and i quote her we have never seen a mind meld of the kind between the russian leadership and a candidate for the presidency of the united states michael morell who ran the cia and grew up just a few miles from here has said that putin is manipulating donald putin is a trained intelligence officer from the old kgb he knows he can use flattery to get into donalds head  to make donald the kremlins puppet and it seems to be working

donald has signaled to putin that he will let russia do whatever it wants from ukraine to syria and beyond hes even said putin is a stronger leader than president obama and it gets worse the us intelligence community has now confirmed that the russian government which means putin is directing cyberattacks against targets in the united states to influence the outcome of our election

so ask yourself why would putin be trying to get donald trump elected president could it be because of all of the nice things donald has said about him or the fact that hes promised to adopt prokremlin policies or maybe because of his extensive business dealings with russian oligarchs with ties to putin since donald still wont release his tax returns and dont hold your breath we dont know the full extent of his business relationships but what we do know is disturbing

and we know this we are dealing with something unprecedented in the history of our country a foreign adversary trying to influence our presidential election that should scare everyone democrat republican and independent with the election just eight days away this cant wait any longer donald trump should immediately disclose all of his ties and connections to the kremlin and its associates the american people deserve to know the full extent of these links and how they relate to what the russians are doing in our election

when you step back and take it all in its no surprise that  republican national security experts wrote an open letter saying that they will not vote for donald trump because he would be  in their words  the most reckless president in american history its no surprise that not a single former president secretary of state or defense or national security advisor from either party has endorsed him its no surprise that bob gates who served eight presidents over  years democrats and republicans alike has said trump is and i quote beyond repair stubbornly uninformed about the world and how to lead our country and government temperamentally unsuited to lead our men and women in uniform unqualified and unfit to be commanderinchief

i hope you and voters across ohio and america will think about all of these national security issues when you cast your vote in this election think about what it takes to lead  and how we want to secure the safety of our country our children and our grandchildren and who is best to do that so make no mistake that really is what is on the ballot this year its not just my name and donald trumps name its our future our security our values its who we are as a country

donald trump has a dark and divisive vision for america that could tear our country apart but the good news is theres another vision for america instead of dark and divisive its hopeful and inclusive and optimistic and unified and it is bighearted not smallminded its about lifting people up not tearing each other down its a vision that says as i believe in my heart that we are stronger together

millions of people across our country are standing up and saying we believe in an america that is great because it is good that is democrats republicans and independents because we believe in an america where women are respected an america where veterans are honored parents are supported and workers are paid fairly  an america where marriage is a right and discrimination is wrong an america that leads in the world and lives up to our values where everyone counts and everyone has a place where the american dream is big enough for everyone

this goes way beyond policies and partisanship were talking about what it really means to be an american in the st century about the basic lessons we want to teach boys and girls kids and grandkids it turns out if you dig deep enough through all the mud of politics eventually you hit something hard and true a foundation of fundamental values that unite us as americans  basic beliefs about equality and opportunity and freedom and common decency

thats something to defend  and to build on and in the end thats what this election is all about here in ohio you can make the difference early voting has already begun so now is the time every phone call you make every door you knock moves us forward you can go to hillaryclintoncom and sign up to volunteer or text join to  to do the same

sometimes  if you have studied history  you know the fate of the greatest nations comes down to single moments in time this is one of those makeorbreak moments for the united states and it truly is in your hands as it should be when your kids and grandkids ask you what you did in  when everything was on the line i hope you will be able to say i voted for a better stronger fairer america a place where our future will be created and charted by people will have confidence that that the best days of america are still ahead of us particularly young people who i believe absolutely should help make that future

so lets come together let us make clear that we are going to stand up for an america that we believe in because that america believes in us and we are going to prove once and for all that love trumps hate thank you"
135,"Clinton","this is amazing what a great place thank you very much we have thousands of people outside trying to get in but we should start do we agree 
we should start so theyll come in theyll come in

first of all i want to thank you special special place its a special place with incredible people in one day do you believe this one day we are going to win the great state of north carolina

and we are going to win back the white house 

this election will decide whether we are ruled by a corrupt political class youre seeing whats happening everybodys watching or whether we are ruled by the people were going to be ruled by the people folks 

that is going to be the choice a failed political establishment has delivered nothing but poverty nothing but problems nothing but losses nothing but losses we dont win anymore as a country were going to start winning again 

they get rich by making america poorer in many cases its time to reject the media and political elite that has bled our country dry 

and these are among the most dishonest people they dont give you the truth folks they dont give you the truth 

they rarely give you the truth you know it and they know it thats the scary part they know it

its time to fight for america im not a politician i can say proudly my only special interest is you its you 

were going to bring back the jobs that have been stolen from you were going to bring back the wealth that has been taken from our country were going to bring back the miners and the factory workers and the steel workers were going to put them back to work 

the economic policies of bill and hillary clinton have destroyed manufacturing in your state and throughout the entire country

the corrupt clintons gave us nafta chinas too horrible entry into the world trade organization one of the disasters the jobkilling deal with south korea that was a hillary clinton beauty and the transpacific partnership which will be a total disaster 

that hillary clinton said this is the gold standard and you know what it is the gold  she lied she lied during the debate she said  hey by the way who won the debate did we win that debate 

but she lied during the debate she lied during the debate she said its the gold standard and then she said she never said it

dont worry about coal were bringing back coal sir hes holding up a couple of

clean coal clean coal right were going to do clean coal the miners the miners are going to be back not if hillary clinton gets in the miners i guess you got to start thinking about something else but the miners are going to be back clean coal clean coal

you know thinking about it though also people the press doesnt talk about it donna brazile gets the questions through a debatebut then it turns out to be a number of debates 

who cares about donna brazile shes turned out to be not what people thought she gets illegally  illegally she gets the questions to the debate she then takes those questions and gives them to crooked hillary clinton 

now does crooked hillary report it does she say i shouldnt have these questions or these answers i think they gave them the answers also right no she doesnt they doesnt

i wonder if she had  i wonder if she had the questions in my debates i dont think so because she didnt do that well i dont think so i dont think so but the years of betrayal will end and they will end and theyre going to end quickly theyre going to end as of the day we take office which is going to be very very soon 

the theft of north carolina jobs will end youve taken in harder than most states

real change begins with immediately repealing and replacing obamacare 

sadly its just been announced that the residents of north carolina are going to experience massive doubledigit premium hikes ninetyfiveof the  north carolina counties will only have one insurer in the obamacare exchange next year lots of luck negotiating

honestly its not going to matter because were going to win and were going to terminate it youre going to have such great health carefor much less money it wont matter 

premiums are searching companies are leaving insurers are fleeing doctors are quitting

by the way doctors theyre leaving theyre quitting i have a friend whos a doctor he said that i have more accountants than i have nurses its so complicated

and deductibles are going through the roof yet hillary clinton wants to double down and expand obamacare and make it even more expensive 

im asking for your vote so we can repeal and replace obamacare and save health care for every family in north carolina 

thank you thank you

thank you 

people are pouring in folks theyre pouring in

did you see last night in michigan the crowd we had and the crowd we had  by the way how about  maybe  right next to fort brag you saw that the other night 

and we went to minnesota minnesotas been treated very very badly we went to minnesota where were doing very well everyone said why minnesota that doesnt go republican its going republican this year ill tell you minnesota great place

and you know youve been watching and youve been seeing and these people are being driven crazy the dishonest media were winning ohio were winning iowa were winning we think new hampshire were going to do great in new hampshire i hear were winning north carolina big 

i hear

then were winning plenty of other places so we have to go the big key you have to go you dont win a rigged system folks were in a rigged system you got to go you got to vote got to make sure that vote gets registered

real change also means restoring honesty to our government

thank you thank you wow great great spirit

i have a job right next to  we have a beautiful beautiful property right next to  right near charlotte you know about it folks its great right some of the people but its an amazing place its an amazing place to work and to live and we love it

hillary clinton is the most corrupt person ever to seek the office of the presidency of the united states 

she threatened national security she sold her office to the highest bidder and then to cover her tracksshe deleted  emails after receiving a congressional subpoena nothing happens to her nothing happens 

shes being protected by a totally rigged system  general james cartwright a fourstar general two weeks ago probably going to jail for up to five years for doing nothing by comparison but he said he did it for national security reasons and i can understand that go to jail for up to five years general betrayes his life was destroyed and here she is she is running for president  times worse than anybody has ever dreamt its a rigged system it is a rigged rigged system 

dont worry folks the cameras will never spin around and show this crowd they never do they show my face and the two people behind me not the thousands behind me they never do they never do  

so dishonest there they are there they are my group women for trump 

women for trump 

theyve been following me these ladies for a long time how are we doing are we doing well

great people women for trump

and now its up to the american people to deliver the justice that we deserve at the ballot box tomorrow at the ballot box were going to win

i think its a great way of showing what we have to show in light of whats going on with justice in this country i really do i think its a great way you show it tomorrow we show it tomorrow

my contract with the american voter begins with a plan to end government corruption and to take our country back from the special interests 

and folks i was on the other side for a long time its a very good place to be but i love the country i love this country ive really gotten to love the people of this country because i have been everywhere we have the greatest people on earth but i love this country

and i couldnt watch it when they made the iran deal they gave them  billion a terrorist state 

a state that was ready to collapse until we made them rich and powerful we gave them a path to nuclear weapons they were ready to collapse we gave them remember  billion right we gave them  million then we found out that was  it wasnt  million it was  billion in cash in cash do you know what  billion in cash is you could take that whole side of the arena and you wouldnt have enough room how stupid are we to allow this to happen our leaders are incompetent president obama is campaigning today with hillary clinton because she cant campaign 

she cant campaign 

so obama is taking air force one which costs a fortune you know hes very much into the environment and hell take a massive old engine  very much into the environment very much into the ozone layer and yet hell fly that  all over the place to campaign for crooked hillary

and i dont think its going to work and shes not getting any crowds so she gets beyonce and jayz i like them 

i like them 

and you know what they do i get bigger crowds than they do 

its true i get far bigger crowds 

look at this place i mean look at the crowds we had in michigan

by the way michigan is in play it hasnt been in play for republicans for  something years michigan is in play because theyre tired of watching their car factories be taken out theyre tired of losing their jobs to mexico

ford ford right now moved all of its small car production to mexico theyre building the biggest plants in the world in mexico and michigan has been complaining about it for five years to mexico 

no were going to have some  tomorrows going to be a very historic day i really believe that i think its going to show  i think its going to be a brexit plus plus plus does that make sense 

plus plus plus 

it will be amazing it will be amazing

i want the entire corrupt washington establishment to hear the words were all about to say this is a phrase i told you i didnt like it i thought it was hokie but its not hokie its called drain the swamp

were going to go to washington were going to drain the swamp cant believe it

i told the story i hated that expression i said no way im going to say that no way thats so hokie and i said it the place went crazy

then i said it to another place it went crazier then i said it with more confidence because you know confidence is  and it went wild now i love the expression i think it was genius

drain the swamp drain the swamp 

is there any place better to be than a trump rally are we having fun 

are we having fun no and i dont have a guitar and i dont have a piano all we have is great concepts for our country which is the most important thing because frankly when people get on stage and theyre entertainers and they entertain in order to get people to fill up a room for hillary clinton

and by the way they use the dirtiest language the other night and it was  many of the people left you know theyre political people they heard words theyve never heard before they left

so the place was half empty by the time  actually it never got full even with them then it was pretty much empty midway through and then most of the people just left and when hillary got up there was practically  she might as well just have started with a few people it wouldve been easier 

but you know she hears those words i wont use the words i wont even address the words because if i do the crooked media will say did you hear what donald trump said today

but honestly  yes 

those words were disgusting if i ever said those words that jayz said or that beyonce said the other night you know what would happen to me the reinstitution of the electric chair

it would be  how about if i got the answers to the debate or if i got the questions supposing instead of hillary getting the questions to the debate which is cheating shes a cheat she is a cheat she never reported it she is a cheat

so supposing instead of her  supposing somebody gave donald trump the questions to the debate headlines all over the world he must withdraw from the race you dont even hear anything about crooked hillary she got the questions

to me thats such a big difference some people say my people oh dont mention that its just  i say to me its a big deal

its a big deal but its not a big deal for the dishonest media to say they dont want to report it but just think about it supposing it was us

at the core of my contract is my plan to bring back our jobs bring them back to america 

and by the way you have a great governor support your governor hes a great guy  where is he hes here someplace hes a great guy and hes in a tough fight and hes going to win that fight but hes a great guy so hopefully youll support your governor

north carolina has lost nearly half of its manufacturing jobs since nafta a deal signed by bill clinton and his lovely wife hillary 

well think of it think of it think of the numbers of jobs

heres the one that gets me the most two things get me the most two things that just dont seem real because were going to take care of our veterans right like big league because our veterans are great

but two statistics i cant believe twentytwo suicides a day for our veterans

think of it you wouldnt think thats possible because theyre treated so badly they wait on line for six seven eight days for simple procedure that could solve their problem or for a prescription

but two numbers i dont  it just doesnt make sense twentytwo suicides a day for our veterans ok it doesnt make sense

and heres another one america has lost  factories now i thought they meant  or  maybe its  factories since china entered the world trade organization another bill and hillary clintonbacked disaster

think of it though 

think of what  factories is

so those are the two numbers they just dont seem to be real sad numbers sad numbers especially the vets to be honest with you

were living through the greatest jobs theft in the history of our world theres never been anything happened to a country like has been happening to the united states our jobs are fleeing our companies are being taken and leaving and leaving

a trump administration will stop the jobs from leaving america and we will stop the jobs from leaving north carolina believe me 

if a company wants to fire their workers and leave as an example north carolina and move to another country and then ship their products back into the united states through what will be a very strong border by the way

we will make them pay a  percent tax on every product that they ship back here 

and heres whats going to happen theyre not going to leave theyre not going to leave

now your politicians some of them dont understand it some only cut taxes for the middle class and by the way hillary clinton wants to raise your taxes and you know that 

substantially

so one of the highest taxes in the world she wants to raise your taxes same old story

we will unleash the power of american energy including shale oil natural gas and clean coal our plan will end the epa intrusion into your family farms and stop double taxation of a family farm at that 

we will cancel billions in global warming payments to the united nations billions and billions of dollars and we have no idea what they do with that money i actually have a pretty good idea youre not going to like it and use that  were going to use that money to rebuild the infrastructure of our country 

and we will rebuild our inner cities the africanamerican community the hispanic communityhave had such lies told to them they live  many many people living in the inner cities of our country theyre getting worse and worse the crime is unbelievable you cant walk to the store and get a loaf of bread often you get shot

chicago thousands and thousands of shootings since jan  you read it the murder rate of the united states is the highest its been in  years the dishonest media doesnt tell you that stuff because they want you to like obama they want you to think obama is doing a good job and hes not  and hes not 

and hes not 

so you live in the inner cities youre africanamerican youre hispanic the schools are no good there are no jobs and its totally unsafe and i say i will fix it what the hell do you have to lose im going to fix it 

we are all going to fix it 

were going to fix it were going to bring back jobs were going to bring back safety and were going to get really good education going there is tremendous potential folks in the inner cities believe me tremendous potential

we will become a rich nation again but to be a rich nation we must also be a safe nation hillary clinton wants a  percent increase in syrian refugees flowing into our country 

unbelievable its unbelievable 

her plan will import generations of terrorism extremism and radicalism into your schools and throughout your communities and you dont even know where theyre going your government doesnt even know where theyre going

when im elected president we will suspend the syrian refugee programand we will keep radical islamic terrorists the hell out of our country 

have no choice 

we have no choice

 usa usa usa

 we have no choice

but were going to work because we all have hearts and its a big problem caused to a large extent by obama and hillary clinton

the migration caused to a large extent  isis was caused by them they left a big vacuum there was no isis when she first served as secretary there was no isis she created it

now she stands at the debate i will fight isis shes got no chance shes going to fight nobody she wants to go home and go to sleep 

unbelievable shes going to fight isis

so were going to build  were going to build we are going to build safe havens were going to have the gulf states who have nothing but money theyre going to pay for it we have  trillion in debt and if its ok im not going to spend a penny we have  trillion in debt and we still have to rebuild our country

you know its one thing like when you buy a company and its got some debt we have  trillion in debt but the countrys a mess the roads are bad the bridges are bad the schools are bad the hospitals are bad the tunnels are bad everythings bad the military needs massive amounts of money

so we have all this horrible debt its one thing if we had it and everythings in tippy top shape i like to say you know i like the properties give me them i want them give me them but we have them and theyre a mess and we have  trillion which is far too much

so were going to get it down and were going to rebuild our country we have so many things were going to be doing were going to be a rich nation again 

a trump administration will also secure and defend the borders of the united states 

and yes we will build a great wall and mexico will pay for the wall  percent 

one hundred percent 

mexico will pay if you look at the incredible  if you look at the incredible deficits we have with mexico its unbelievable what we have the cost of that wall is peanuts is peanuts compared to the numbers youre talking about on trade with mexico

and the numbers with china trade deficit i mean we will have a trade deficit with china of close to  billion this year we are going to lose in worldwide trade of goods were going to lose worldwide close to  billion what are we doing

you really ask who is negotiating these deals where do these people come you know where they come from theyre political hacks

youre dealing with the smartest people in the world you have chinese people every  you have from japan you have from all these other countries they put their smartest and the best we put political hacks that dont know what theyre doing

so we have an  and we have the greatest in the world we have the greatest business people we have the greatest negotiators we dont use them we dont use them we use political people some of them got their job because they give campaign contributions 

were going to get it straightened out folks starting tomorrow go vote go vote 

right

my women hillary supports totally open borders there goes your country and strongly supports sanctuary cities like san francisco where kate steinle was murdered violently by an illegal immigrant deported at least five times we will cancel all federal funding to sanctuary cities 

we will stop illegal immigration deport all criminal aliens and dismantle every last criminal gang and cartel threatening our citizens 

we will also repeal the obamaclinton defense sequester and rebuild our badly depleted military 

there have been few times in our history where weve needed it more few times north carolina will be at the very center of this effort with brand new advanced fighters flying from seymour johnson air force base 

beautiful beautiful beautiful beautiful new fighters from seymour johnson

and were going to have more battalions you know the marines are way way off in terms of numbers you know that i know has there ever been yes there have been but rarely do we have times when we need this strong presence like now the world hates us the world hates us

so were going to increase  thank you were going to increase marine battalions at camp lejeune ive been to camp lejeune

they make major new investments where i was the other night right next to it i guess like  or  people at fort bragg 

great people all soldiers are tough a couple of them shook my hand it was like oy whoa take it easy fellas they are tough cookies they are strong they dont know how strong they are these are great people

and new military technologies will be researched and developed right here at the research triangle right here 

im honored to have the endorsements of more than  top admirals and generals and  medal of honor recipients and every day those numbers go up big league big league show less text

and i asked some of the generals and admirals the other night by fort bragg i asked them i said fellas let me ask you a question they want to take over mosul am i getting something wrong whatever happened to the element of surprise for us

im talking to admirals now and generals thats what they do i do other things but you know its called like common sense

you got to say weve made a lot of right calls i said why is it that four months away from going into mosul theyre announcing we are going into mosul were going into mosul because we want to get the leaders of isis and theyre staying in mosul and then three months theyre saying we are going in in three months to mosul and then were going in in two months

and every time i hear i put my hands i go like this i dont want to hear this please and as you know theyve been met with tremendous resistance much more than they wouldve been

and i guarantee you this i cant say it with certainty only about  percent ok i cant say  nothings  percent even our victory isnt  percent but its starting to look pretty close isnt it 

those numbers those numbers 

oh these guys are unhappy look at them theyre not happy they are unhappy campers starting to look good 

starting to look good

but wouldnt it be nice if instead of announcing four months ago and there months ago then they have last  two weeks ago they go next week were getting ready to raid

the leaders all left theyre gone and the other people are putting up much more of a fight horrible theyre using human shields its a horrible situation i mean its hell its hell

but why do we just watch whats going on hillary and her failed establishment have trillion dollars on wars in the middle east that we never win we just keep fighting and fighting its like a hose the money just keeps pouring out we never win

and now the middle east is in worse shape by far than its ever been we have the great migration the whole thing theyve dragged  thank you 

i dont even want to look ill get myself i dont want to look 

theyll make it  i wont even say i love you too because theyre going to make it a major headline if i said that worlds most dishonest people the worlds really dishonest people 

they dragged us into foreign wars that have made us less safe shipped our jobs and wealth all over  right open at home you ever notice we send these incredible troops so much death so much injury in order to create a border for a country that most people have never even heard of and yet we dont protect our own borders isnt it an incredible thing

that will change starting tomorrow 

because from now on its going to be america first america first 

so just in summing up to all americans i say its time for a real leadership and time for change we have to have change 

can you imagine having hillary for four years 

im being serious about that i wouldnt want to watch the news every night

i mean look at what shes done with the emails as an example i mean did you ever see a mess like this did you ever see  of course the fbi  the director was obviously under tremendous pressure so they went through  emails in eight days right

so sad whats going on and she still deleted them after getting a subpoena from congress i mean thats a crime what happened thats a crime you dont even need the new stuff she shouldnt be allowed to run shouldnt be allowed to run

just think about what we can accomplish in the first  days of a trump administration 

were going to have the biggest tax cuts since ronald reagan

and hillary is going to raise your taxes substantially

were going to save and protect your social security and medicare 

and hillary is going to cut your social security and really injure medicare thats whats going to happen

we will eliminate every unnecessary jobkilling regulation well cancel every illegal obama executive order 

by the way a man that loves this state its his birthday today billy graham  

the father of franklin billy graham what a great one right ninetyeight years old he is a fantastic man franklins a fantastic man and its so wonderful to have support of people like that

were going to protect religious libertyrebuild our military and take care of our great veterans were going to take care of our veterans 

we will provide school choice and put an end to common core we move our education locally 

we will support the men and women  these are great people the men and women of law enforcement 

were going to save our second amendment 

and appoint justices to the united states supreme court who will uphold and defend the constitution of the united states 

this sounds so good to me because i started this on june th of last year because i couldnt stand when i looked at what was going on with our country i couldnt stand it i couldnt stand it

coming down the escalator right with melania coming down that escalator june  of last year and they were all saying  there were all the dishonest pundits actually a few of them thought i had a hell of a chance if you want to know the  the smarter ones but they were all saying but hes not involved with  ive been involved with politics all my life on the other side but ive been involved

we had  people  by the way one of the great people in here tonight mike huckabee where is mike huckabee 

hes such  is he here someplace he is here he is so great mike wherever you are come on out because you are great i just saw him

but we had  people of great talent ben carson endorsed us mike

mike endorsed us tremendous  i mean very talented people and one by one by one  and they used to say  well i remember we were down to like  or  in one state i got  percent and one of these clowns said he has not reached the  percent mark i got  percent with like  people how do you get  percent with  people and they said he hasnt reached the  percent mark theyre very dishonest people

so we ended up with  people right dont forget thats hard because nobody else ever had a field that big or that violent or that violent

and we have a couple that didnt endorse and thats too bad you know they signed a pledge they didnt honor it but

but  no but for the most part

no for the most part they were very honorable but it was rough they said it was the roughest primary every i would say this is the roughest election

you know the nfl ratings are way down you know why because everyones watching this its actually tougher its actually tougher 

everyones watching the nfl ratings are way down a lot of people say its because of this

so you had  people youve came down  but weve got  and this is a tribute to everybody in this room we got the highest number of voters in the history of the republican primary system 

so well done 

thats a long time you know starting with honest abe lincoln right thats a long time i got more than honest abe thats really the only thing i did better than honest abe honest abe was pretty  he was pretty good

so heres the beauty you have one day until the election and its not even one day its a half a day to make every dream youve ever dreamed for your country and for your family to come true you have one magnificent chance and honestly in four years its over folks

there has never been a movement like this even these dishonest people in the media say there has never  bill oreilly he said its the single greatest political phenomena that hes witnessed in his life thats a pretty good statement 

but others have said it others have said it others have said it and its not going to happen again it wont be able to happen again four years itll never happen so you got to get out there and you got to vote got to get out

somebody said what youve done has never been done before it doesnt matter if you win or lose i said believe me it matters no they said that itll be down in the history books i said you know what you may be right about that

but if we dont win i will consider this the single greatest waste of time energy wow do i  you need energy for this the single greatest waste of time energy and money

i have over  million thats a lot of money that i dont take in from the special interests because i dont need it thats nice

and we have the biggest internet  you know the small donors the small donors are giving us money at record clips i think we had  million and then we had close to  million and it comes in and i think the average was like  each i love those people those are people that love this country 

and usually thats for the democrats you know in all fairness thats usually for the democrats to do that but were beating everybody nobodys seen anything like what were doing

so we dont want to blow it we dont want to waste it go vote go vote because believe me if we dont win all of us honestly weve all wasted our time ill be honest because nothings going to happen

they may say good things about us as a movement wont mean a damn thing folks you got to go out we got to vote and we got to win change

so you have one magnificent chance to beat the corrupt system that youre witnessing today and to deliver justice for every forgotten man and woman and child in this nation do not let this opportunity slip away were fighting for every citizen who believes that government should serve the people not the donors and not the special interests 

and were fighting were fighting to bring us all together as americans were a very divided country people dont realize we are an unbelievably divided country were going to come together

just imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as one people under one god saluting one american flag 

just imagine

im asking you to dream big because with your vote we are just one day away from the change youve been waiting for for your entire life 

because if we win tomorrow we will be able to make america wealthy again to make america strong again to make america safe again and to make america great again

thank you god bless you thank you north carolina 

thank you folks thank you"
136,"Clinton","thank you it is so great to be here in florida
in  days we are going to win the state and we are going to win the white house

our movement is about replacing a failed and corrupt political establishment with a new government controlled by you the american people

there is nothing the political establishment will not do and no lie they will not tell to hold on to their prestige and power at your expense

the washington establishment and the financial and media corporations that fund it exists for only one reason to protect and enrich itself

the establishment has trillions of dollars at stake in this election as an example just one single trade deal theyd like to pass involves trillions of dollars controlled by many countries corporations and lobbyists

for those who control the levers of power in washington and for the global special interests they partner with our campaign represents an existential threat

this is not simply another year election this is a crossroads in the history of our civilization that will determine whether or not we the people reclaim control over our government

the political establishment that is trying everything to stop us is the same group responsible for our disastrous trade deals massive illegal immigration and economic and foreign policies that have bled this country dry the political establishment has brought about the destruction of our factories and our jobs as they flee to mexico china and other countries throughout the world our justannounced jobs numbers are anemic and our gross domestic product or gdp is barely above one percent workers in the united states were making less than they were almost  years ago  and yet they are working harder

its a global power structure that is responsible for the economic decisions that have robbed our working class stripped our country of its wealth and put that money into the pockets of a handful of large corporations and political entities

just look at what this corrupt establishment has done to our cities like detroit and flint michigan  and rural towns in pennsylvania ohio north carolina and across our country they have stripped these towns bare and raided the wealth for themselves and taken away their jobs

the clinton machine is at the center of this power structure weve seen this firsthand in the wikileaks documents in which hillary clinton meets in secret with international banks to plot the destruction of us sovereignty in order to enrich these global financial powers

and likewise the emails show that the clinton machine is so closely and irrevocably tied to media organizations that she is given the questions and answers in advance of her debates clinton is also given approval and veto power over quotes written about her in the new york times and the emails show the reporters collaborate and conspire directly with the clinton campaign on helping her win the election

with their control over our government at stake with trillions of dollars on the line the clinton machine is determined to achieve the destruction of our campaign which has now become a movement the likes of which our country has never seen before  and we wont let them do that

the most powerful weapon deployed by the clintons is the corporate media lets be clear on one thing the corporate media in our country is no longer involved in journalism they are a political special interest no different than any lobbyist or other financial entity with an agenda and their agenda is to elect the clintons at any cost at any price no matter how many lives they destroy

for them it is a war  and for them nothing is out of bounds

this is a struggle for the survival of our nation this election will determine whether we are a free nation or whether we have only the illusion of democracy but are in fact controlled by a small handful of global special interests rigging the system

this is not just conspiracy but reality and you and i know it

the establishment and their media enablers wield control over this nation through means that are well known anyone who challenges their control is deemed a sexist a racist a xenophobe and morally deformed they will attack you they will slander you they will seek to destroy your career and reputation and they will lie lie and lie even more

the clintons are criminals this is welldocumented and the establishment that protects them has engaged in a massive coverup of widespread criminal activity at the state department and clinton foundation in order to keep the clintons in power never in history have we seen such a coverup as this one that includes the destruction of  emails  phones laptops missing boxes of evidence and on and on

people who are capable of such crimes against our nation are capable of anything

and so now we address the slander and libels that was just last night thrown at me by the clinton machine the new york times and other media outlets as part of a concerted coordinated and vicious attack

it is not coincidence that these attacks come at the exact same moment and all together at the same time as the wikileaks documents expose the massive international corruption of the clinton machine  including  more emails this morning

these claims about me of inappropriate conduct with women are totally and absolutely false  and the clinton machine knows it is its all fabricated its pure fiction and outright lies these events never happened the claims are preposterous ludicrous and defy truth common sense and logic

we already have substantial evidence to dispute these lies and it will be made public in the appropriate way and at the appropriate time these lies come from outlets whose past stories and past claims have already been discredited the media outlets did not even attempt to confirm the most basic facts because even a simple investigation would have shown these are false smears

whats happening to me is no different than what happened to other innocent people like the story written in rolling stone magazine  and that magazine should be put out of business

six months ago the new york times wrote a massive story attacking me and the central witness they used said the story was false that she was quoted inaccurately she said i was a great guy and never made those remarks

we demanded a retraction but they refused to print it  just like they refused to print the comments from another source who praised me in her book or the words of another wonderful woman who said nice things

that story was a fraud and an embarrassment to the new york times it will be part of the lawsuit we are preparing against them now today the same two discredited writers who should have been fired from the times tell a totally fabricated and false story that supposedly took place on an airplane more than  years ago  another ridiculous tale no witnesses no nothing

also a writer from people magazine who wrote a story on melania and myself on our first anniversary the story was lovely but last night we hear after  years a new claim that i made inappropriate advances i ask a very simple question why wasnt it part of the story that appeared  years ago i was one of the biggest stars on television and it would have been one of the biggest stories of the year take a look at her words it would have been the headline no it only appears  days before the election

this invented account has already been debunked by eyewitness testimony  the very witness identified by the author has said the story is entirely false

this weekend the new york times published a fullpage hit piece with another claim from an individual who has been totally discredited based on the emails and letters she has sent to our office over the years but the new york times refused to use the evidence we presented them others have likewise were presented with this story but after seeing the evidence we provided refused to print it

this is part of a concerted effort led by the new york times which is fighting desperately for its relevance and survival and which probably wont even be around in a few years based on its financial outlook has become more and more vicious and vile

i will not allow the clinton machine to turn this campaign into a discussion of their slanders and lies but will remain focused on the issues facing the american people

but let me state this as clearly as i can these attacks are orchestrated by the clintons and their media allies they are false and slanderous in every respect we are now less than a month from the most important election of our lifetime  indeed one the most important elections in modern history  and the polls show us in a dead heat and the new rasmussen poll shows us  points ahead

so now the clinton machine has put forward a small handful of people out of the tens of thousands i have met worked with and employed  in order to make wild and false allegations that fail to meet even the most basic test of common sense again this is nothing more than an attempt to destroy our movement and for the clintons to keep their corrupt control over this government

when i declared my candidacy i knew what bad shape our country was in i had seen firsthand the corruption and the sickness that has taken over our politics i knew they would throw every lie they could at me and my family and my loved ones

i knew they would stop at nothing to try to stop me

but i take all of these slings and arrows for you i take them for our movement so that we can have our country back

our great civilization here in america and across the civilized world has come upon a moment of reckoning

weve seen it in the united kingdom where they voted to liberate themselves from global government and global trade deals and global immigration deals that have destroyed their sovereignty

but the central base of world political power is here in america and it is our corrupt political establishment that is the greatest power behind the efforts at radical globalization and the disenfranchisement of working people

their financial resources are unlimited their political resources are unlimited their media resources are unlimited and most importantly the depths of their immorality is unlimited

our political establishment has no soul

i knew these false attacks would come i knew this day would arrive and i knew the american people would rise above it and vote for the future they deserve

the only thing that can stop the corrupt clinton machine is you the only force strong enough to save this country is you the only people brave enough to vote out this corrupt establishment is you the american people

they control the department of justice and they even clandestinely meet with the attorney general of the united states  in the back of her airplane while on the runway  for  minutes  to most likely discuss her reappointment in a clinton administration just prior to the attorney general making a decision over whether or not to prosecute hillary clinton

likewise they have corrupted the director of the fbi to the point at which stories are already saying the great men and women who work for the fbi are embarrassed and ashamed to what hes done to one of our great institutions hillary clinton is guilty of all of the things that director comey stated at his press conference and congressional hearings and far more  and yet he let her off the hook while others lives are being destroyed for far less

this is a conspiracy against you the american people

this is our moment of reckoning as a society and as a civilization

i didnt need to do this i built a great company and i had a wonderful life i could have enjoyed the benefits of years of successful business for myself and my family instead of going through this absolute horror show of lies deceptions and malicious attacks im doing it because this country has given me so much and i feel strongly it was my turn to give back

some people warned me this campaign would be a journey to hell but they are wrong it will be a journey to heaven because we will help so many people

in my former life i was an insider as much as anybody else  and i know whats like to be an insider now i am being punished for leaving their special club and revealing to you their great scam because i used to be part of the club im the only one who can fix it im doing this for the people and this movement is just right  and we will take back this country for you and make america great again

the corrupt establishment knows that we are an existential threat to their criminal enterprise they know that if we win their power is gone and returned to you the clouds hanging over our government can be lifted and replaced with a bright future  but it all depends on whether we let the new york times decide our future or whether we let the american people decide our future

if this clinton campaign of destruction is allowed to work then no other highly successful person  which is what our country needs  will ever again run for this office

i will not lie to you these false attacks hurt to be lied about to be slandered to be smeared so publicly and before your family is painful

what the clinton machine is doing to me and my family is egregious beyond words it is reprehensible beyond description

but i also know its not about me  its about all of you its about all of us together as a country

its about the veterans who need medical care the mothers whove lost children to terrorism and crime its about the inner cities and the border towns who desperately need our help its about the millions of jobless americans this election is about the people being crushed by obamacare and its about defeating isis and appointing supreme court justices who will defend our constitution

this election is also about the africanamerican and hispanic communities whose communities have been plunged into crime poverty and failing schools by the policies of hillary clinton theyve robbed these citizens of their future and i will give them their hope jobs and opportunities back i will deliver

this election is about every man woman and child in our country who deserves to live in safety prosperity and peace

we will rise above the lies the smears and the ludicrous slanders from ludicrous reporters

we will vote for the country we want

we will vote for the future we want

we will vote for the politics we want

we will vote to put this corrupt government cartel out of business we will remove from our politics the special interests who have betrayed our workers our borders our freedoms and our sovereign rights as a nation we will end the politics of profit we will end the rule of special interests we will put a stop to the raiding of our country  and the disenfranchisement of our people

our independence day is at hand and it arrives finally on november th join me in taking back our country and creating a bright and glorious new dawn for our people"
